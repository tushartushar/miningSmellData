Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Octopus.Platform.Util,SilentProcessRunner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\Util\SilentProcessRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExecuteCommand
Deficient Encapsulation,Octopus.Platform.Util,CPINFOEX,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\Util\SilentProcessRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MaxCharSize' DefaultChar' LeadBytes' UnicodeDefaultChar' CodePage' CodePageName
Broken Modularization,Octopus.Platform.Util,CPINFOEX,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\Util\SilentProcessRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MaxCharSize' DefaultChar' LeadBytes' UnicodeDefaultChar' CodePage' CodePageName
Broken Hierarchy,Octodiff.Tests,DeltaFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\DeltaFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Octodiff.Tests.Util.CommandLineFixture
Broken Hierarchy,Octodiff.Tests,HelpFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\HelpFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Octodiff.Tests.Util.CommandLineFixture
Broken Hierarchy,Octodiff.Tests,PatchFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\PatchFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Octodiff.Tests.Util.CommandLineFixture
Broken Hierarchy,Octodiff.Tests,SignatureFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\SignatureFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Octodiff.Tests.Util.CommandLineFixture
Broken Hierarchy,Octodiff.Tests,TimingsFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OctopusDeploy_Octodiff\source\Octodiff.Tests\Timings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Octodiff.Tests.Util.CommandLineFixture
