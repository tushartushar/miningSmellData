Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,OrzeszekTimer,Settings,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: OrzeszekTimer.Settings' OrzeszekTimer.Properties.Settings
Duplicate Abstraction,OrzeszekTimer,TaskbarProgressState,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\TaskbarUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: TaskbarProgressState[1' 21]' App[1' 21]' MainWindow[1' 21]
Multifaceted Abstraction,OrzeszekTimer,MainWindow,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Unutilized Abstraction,OrzeszekTimer,MainWindow,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OrzeszekTimer,MainWindow,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: MainWindow[152' 176]' MainWindow[216' 240]
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrzeszekTimer.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,OrzeszekTimer,Settings,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' LastTimeSpan' WindowHeight' WindowWidth' WindowTop' WindowLeft' WindowState' WindowSettingsSaved' AlarmSound' CurrentStart' CurrentEnd' TimerRunning' RememberTimerOnClose' LoopTimer' CloseOnFinish' ScaleInterface' LoopNotification' PopupOnFinish' FlashOnFinish' ShowTimerInTray' AlwaysOnTop' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,OrzeszekTimer,MainWindow,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,OrzeszekTimer,MainWindow,C:\repos\tqheel_teqtimer\Orzeszek Timer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
