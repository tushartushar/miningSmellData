Unutilized Abstraction,GitTfs.VsCommon,WrapperForWorkItemCheckinInfo,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\Wrappers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GitTfs.VsCommon,WrapperForWorkItemCheckedInfo,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\Wrappers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GitTfs,TfsPlugin,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GitTfs.VsCommon,MergeInfo,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SourceChangeType' SourceChangeset' SourceItem' TargetChangeType' TargetChangeset' TargetItem
Insufficient Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 68 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 141
Rebellious Hierarchy,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetIdentity
Rebellious Hierarchy,GitTfs,TfsPlugin,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
Broken Hierarchy,GitTfs.Vs2012,TfsHelper,C:\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.Vs2012\TfsHelper.Vs2012.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GitTfs.VsCommon.TfsHelperVs2012Base
