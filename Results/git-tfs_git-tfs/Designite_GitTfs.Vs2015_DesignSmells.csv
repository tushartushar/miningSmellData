Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetWorkItemInfosHelper which is more interested in members of the type: TfsApiBridge
Unutilized Abstraction,GitTfs.VsCommon,ItemDownloadStrategy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GitTfs,TfsPlugin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GitTfs.VsCommon,MergeInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SourceChangeType' SourceChangeset' SourceItem' TargetChangeType' TargetChangeset' TargetItem
Insufficient Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 68 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 152
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,WrapperForVersionControlServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\Wrappers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForVersionControlServer' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForChangeset
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,WrapperForItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\Wrappers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForItem' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForVersionControlServer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,WrapperForChangeset,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\Wrappers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForChangeset' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForVersionControlServer' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForItem
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GitTfs.VsCommon,WrapperForVersionControlServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\Wrappers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForVersionControlServer' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForItem' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForChange' GitTfs.VsCommon.WrapperForChangeset
Rebellious Hierarchy,GitTfs.VsCommon,TfsHelperBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsHelper.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetIdentity
Rebellious Hierarchy,GitTfs,TfsPlugin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\git-tfs_git-tfs\src\GitTfs.VsCommon\TfsPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
