Unnecessary Abstraction,Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab,MyClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzzprojects_Z.ExtensionMethods\lab\Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab,MyClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzzprojects_Z.ExtensionMethods\lab\Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzzprojects_Z.ExtensionMethods\lab\Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Z.Reflection.Documentation.Test,Entity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzzprojects_Z.ExtensionMethods\lab\Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab\_Model\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FieldInt
Deficient Encapsulation,Z.Reflection.Documentation.Test,Entity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzzprojects_Z.ExtensionMethods\lab\Z.ExtensionMethods.Lab\_Model\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields.
