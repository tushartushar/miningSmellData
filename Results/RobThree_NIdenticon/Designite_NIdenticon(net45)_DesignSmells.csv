Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Devcorner.NIdenticon,IdenticonGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NIdenticon\NIdenticon\IdenticonGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Devcorner.NIdenticon,IdenticonGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NIdenticon\NIdenticon\IdenticonGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultBlockGeneratorsConfig' ExtendedBlockGeneratorsConfig' DefaultBrushGeneratorConfig
Deficient Encapsulation,Devcorner.NIdenticon,IdenticonGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NIdenticon\NIdenticon\IdenticonGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultBlockGeneratorsConfig' ExtendedBlockGeneratorsConfig' DefaultBrushGeneratorConfig
Insufficient Modularization,Devcorner.NIdenticon,IdenticonGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NIdenticon\NIdenticon\IdenticonGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Devcorner.NIdenticon,IdenticonGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NIdenticon\NIdenticon\IdenticonGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Devcorner.NIdenticon.BlockGenerators,BlockGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NIdenticon\NIdenticon\BlockGenerators\BlockGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Draw
