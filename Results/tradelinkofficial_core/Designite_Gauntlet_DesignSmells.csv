Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,WinGauntlet,GauntArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Gauntlet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' TicksProcessed' Executions' PlayTo' Started' Stopped
Deficient Encapsulation,WinGauntlet,Optimize,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Optimize.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Dll' ResponseName' OptimizeName' StartAt' StopAt' Advance' OptimizeDecisionsName' isHigherDecisionValuesBetter' isRunning
Deficient Encapsulation,WinGauntlet,GauntletOptimizationResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Optimize.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: id' results' resultsCalculated' parameter
Deficient Encapsulation,WinGauntlet,gauntletArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Optimize.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dll' response' hsim' value' id
Insufficient Modularization,WinGauntlet,Gauntlet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Gauntlet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 56 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WinGauntlet,Gauntlet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Gauntlet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 119
Broken Modularization,WinGauntlet.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' tickfolder' boxdll' saveonexit' clearmessages' writeonmessages' ordersincsv' csvnamesunique' UseBidAskFills' capitalprompt' PortfolioRealisticSim' ResetOnRun' AssumeHighLiquidEOD' InitialEquity' isSimRunInMemory' OptimizeFinishAt' OptimizeStartAt' defaultInstance
Broken Hierarchy,WinGauntlet,Optimize,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tradelinkofficial_core\Gauntlet\Optimize.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TradeLink.Common.GauntletEngine
