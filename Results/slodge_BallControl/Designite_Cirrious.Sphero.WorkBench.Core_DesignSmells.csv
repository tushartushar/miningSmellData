Unutilized Abstraction,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core,SpheroException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\SpheroException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.Interfaces,ISpheroSpeedService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\Interfaces\ISpheroSpeedService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SpeedPercent
Unutilized Abstraction,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.Interfaces,ISpheroColorService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\Interfaces\ISpheroListService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.Services,SpheroSpeedService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\Services\SpheroSpeedService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SpeedPercent' DefaultSpeedFactor' _speedPercent
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels,ISpheroParentViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\SpheroSubViewModels\ISpheroParentViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectedSphero
Feature Envy,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels,SpheroAccelMovementViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\SpheroSubViewModels\SpheroAccelMovementViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DoEnsureAccelerometerIsOn which is more interested in members of the type: ISimpleAccelerometer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels,BaseViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\BaseViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.BaseViewModel' Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.PhotoListViewModel
Cyclic Hierarchy,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels,BaseViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\BaseViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PhotoListViewModel
Rebellious Hierarchy,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels,BaseSpheroChildViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\SpheroSubViewModels\BaseSpheroChildViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnSpheroConnected
Broken Hierarchy,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels,BaseSpheroMovementViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\SpheroSubViewModels\BaseSpheroMovementViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels.BaseSpheroChildViewModel
Broken Hierarchy,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels,SpheroHeadingViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\SpheroSubViewModels\SpheroHeadingViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels.BaseSpheroChildViewModel
Broken Hierarchy,Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels,SpheroSetupViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slodge_BallControl\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench\Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core\ViewModels\SpheroSubViewModels\SpheroSetupViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cirrious.Sphero.WorkBench.Core.ViewModels.SpheroSubViewModels.BaseSpheroChildViewModel
