Unutilized Abstraction,s4pi.Filetable,GameFoldersForm,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\GameFoldersForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,s4pi.Filetable,PathPackageTuple,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\PathPackageTuple.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PathPackageTuple (C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\PathPackageTuple.cs' [1' 27])' RK (C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\RK.cs' [1' 27])' SpecificResource (C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\SpecificResource.cs' [1' 27])
Imperative Abstraction,s4pi.Filetable,SpecificIndexEntry,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\SpecificResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Equals
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,s4pi.Filetable,PathPackageTuple,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\PathPackageTuple.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: s4pi.Filetable.PathPackageTuple' s4pi.Filetable.SpecificResource
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,s4pi.Filetable,SpecificResource,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\SpecificResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: s4pi.Filetable.SpecificResource' s4pi.Filetable.PathPackageTuple
Rebellious Hierarchy,s4pi.Filetable,RK,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\RK.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone
Broken Hierarchy,s4pi.Filetable,SpecificResource,C:\repos\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\Filetable\SpecificResource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): s4pi.Filetable.SpecificIndexEntry
