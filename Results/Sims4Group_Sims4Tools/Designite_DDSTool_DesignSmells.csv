Duplicate Abstraction,s3pe.DDSTool,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainForm (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\MainForm.cs' [1' 23])' NewDDSParameters (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\NewDDSParameters.cs' [1' 23])

Feature Envy,s3pe.DDSTool,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: openDDS which is more interested in members of the type: DDSPanel
Feature Envy,s3pe.DDSTool,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: openImage which is more interested in members of the type: DDSPanel
Unutilized Abstraction,s3pe.DDSTool,StringExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,s3pe.DDSTool,Result,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\NewDDSParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Red' Green' Blue' Alpha' Width' Height' UseDXT' UseLuminance' AlphaDepth' DialogResult
Insufficient Modularization,s3pe.DDSTool,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Broken Modularization,s3pe.DDSTool,Result,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ViewDDS\DDSTool\NewDDSParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Red' Green' Blue' Alpha' Width' Height' UseDXT' UseLuminance' AlphaDepth' DialogResult
