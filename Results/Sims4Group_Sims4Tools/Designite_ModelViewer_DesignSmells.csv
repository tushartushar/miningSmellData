Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GeostateDictionary' MeshDictionary
Deficient Encapsulation,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: GeostateDictionary' MeshDictionary
Unexploited Encapsulation,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MATD' MTST (in method "FindMainMATD" of class "MainWindow").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sims4Group_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: s3piwrappers.ModelViewer.App' s3piwrappers.ModelViewer.MainWindow
