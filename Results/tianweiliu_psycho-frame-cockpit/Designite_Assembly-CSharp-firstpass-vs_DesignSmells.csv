(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Windows.Kinect,Joint,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\Joint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: JointType' Position' TrackingState
Unutilized Abstraction,Windows.Kinect,JointMap,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\JointMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Windows.Kinect,JointMap,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\JointMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: JointMap[9' 33]' JointMap[43' 67]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Windows.Kinect,JointOrientation,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\JointOrientation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: JointType' Orientation
Unnecessary Abstraction,Windows.Kinect,JointSetting,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\JointSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' applyTransform' jointGameObject
Unutilized Abstraction,Windows.Kinect,TrackingConfidence,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\TrackingConfidence.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Kinect,Body,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\Body.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsTracked' Joints' JointOrientations
Deficient Encapsulation,Windows.Kinect,JointSetting,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\JointSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: applyTransform' jointGameObject
Broken Modularization,Windows.Kinect,JointMap,C:\repos\tianweiliu_psycho-frame-cockpit\source\PsychoFrame-Unity\Assets\Standard Assets\Windows\Kinect\JointMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: _BoneMap' _RadialBoneMap' _MirrorBoneMap' _boneMap' _radialBoneMap' _mirrorBoneMap
