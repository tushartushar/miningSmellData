Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Applications,LemurOscService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Osc\LemurOscService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Add2DPointProperty
Feature Envy,Sce.Atf.Applications,OscService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Osc\OscService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: m_contextRegistry_ActiveContextChanged which is more interested in members of the type: IContextRegistry
Insufficient Modularization,Sce.Atf.Applications,OscService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Osc\OscService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sce.Atf.Applications,OscService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Osc\OscService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Rebellious Hierarchy,Sce.Atf.Applications,OscCommands,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Osc\OscCommands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdateCommand
