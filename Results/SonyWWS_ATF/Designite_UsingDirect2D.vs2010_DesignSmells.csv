Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,UsingDirect2D,TestRT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,UsingDirect2D,TestRT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Render which is more interested in members of the type: D2dHwndGraphics
Unnecessary Abstraction,UsingDirect2D,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Bound' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,UsingDirect2D,Bezier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' P1' P2' P3' P4
Unutilized Abstraction,UsingDirect2D,GdiCanvas,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\GdiCanvas.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,UsingDirect2D,TestRT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: s_lnBrush' s_bmp
Deficient Encapsulation,UsingDirect2D,TestRT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: s_lnBrush' s_bmp
Deficient Encapsulation,UsingDirect2D,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Bound' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,UsingDirect2D,Bezier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: P1' P2' P3' P4
Deficient Encapsulation,UsingDirect2D,Line,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: P1' P2
Insufficient Modularization,UsingDirect2D,Canvas2d,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 116
Rebellious Hierarchy,UsingDirect2D,Canvas2d,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\UsingDirect2D\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnPaintBackground
