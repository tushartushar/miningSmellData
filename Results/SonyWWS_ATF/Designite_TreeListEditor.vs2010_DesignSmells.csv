Unnecessary Abstraction,TreeListEditor,PropertyEditingAttribute,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TreeListEditor,DataComparer,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TreeListEditor,MySorter,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\RawUsage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TreeListEditor.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TreeListEditor,DataItem,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TreeListEditor.DataItem' TreeListEditor.PropertyPropertyDescriptor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TreeListEditor,PropertyPropertyDescriptor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TreeListEditor.PropertyPropertyDescriptor' TreeListEditor.DataItem
Rebellious Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,PropertyPropertyDescriptor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResetValue
Rebellious Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,CommonEditor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize' Deactivate
Unfactored Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,CommonEditor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CommonEditor (C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs' [236' 273])' RawTreeListView (C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\RawUsage.cs' [165' 202])
Unfactored Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,CommonEditor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.

Broken Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,List,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TreeListEditor.CommonEditor
Broken Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,CheckedList,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TreeListEditor.CommonEditor
Broken Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,VirtualList,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TreeListEditor.CommonEditor
Broken Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,TreeList,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TreeListEditor.CommonEditor
