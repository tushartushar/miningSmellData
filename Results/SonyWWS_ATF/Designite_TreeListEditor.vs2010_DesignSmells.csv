Unnecessary Abstraction,TreeListEditor,PropertyEditingAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,TreeListEditor,RawTreeListView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\RawUsage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BtnRemoveItemClick which is more interested in members of the type: TreeListView

Rebellious Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,PropertyPropertyDescriptor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\DataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResetValue
Rebellious Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,CommonEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize' Deactivate
Unfactored Hierarchy,TreeListEditor,CommonEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CommonEditor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\Editors.cs' [236' 273])' RawTreeListView (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\TreeListEditor\RawUsage.cs' [165' 202])
