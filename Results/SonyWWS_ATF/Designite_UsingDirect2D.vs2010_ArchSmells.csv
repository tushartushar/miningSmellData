Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Ambiguous Interface,UsingDirect2D.vs2010,UsingDirect2D,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: Clock,UsingDirect2D.Clock,UsingDirect2D.Clock
Feature Concentration,UsingDirect2D.vs2010,UsingDirect2D,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Form1' Canvas2d' SampleDrawings' Clock' State' Bezier' Line' GdiCanvas' Program]' [TestRT]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.2,UsingDirect2D.TestRT,UsingDirect2D.Form1' UsingDirect2D.TestRT' UsingDirect2D.Canvas2d' UsingDirect2D.SampleDrawings' UsingDirect2D.Clock' UsingDirect2D.State' UsingDirect2D.Bezier' UsingDirect2D.Line' UsingDirect2D.GdiCanvas' UsingDirect2D.Program
