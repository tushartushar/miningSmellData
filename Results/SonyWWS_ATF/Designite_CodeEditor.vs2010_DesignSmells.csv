Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CodeEditor,Editor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CodeEditor.Editor' CodeEditor.DocumentClient
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CodeEditor,DocumentClient,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CodeEditor.DocumentClient' CodeEditor.Editor
Rebellious Hierarchy,CodeEditor,Editor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Deactivate' UpdateCommand
Missing Hierarchy,CodeEditor,Editor,C:\repos\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: StandardCommand' Command (in method "CanDoCommand" of class "Editor").
