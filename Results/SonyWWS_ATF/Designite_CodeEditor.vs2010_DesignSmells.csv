Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,CodeEditor,CodeDocument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\CodeDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateControlInfo which is more interested in members of the type: ControlInfo
Rebellious Hierarchy,CodeEditor,Editor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Deactivate' UpdateCommand
Missing Hierarchy,CodeEditor,Editor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Samples\CodeEditor\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: StandardCommand' Command (in method "CanDoCommand" of class "Editor").
