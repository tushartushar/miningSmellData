Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters' TimelineEditorSample,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.HelpAboutCommand' TimelineEditorSample.Resources' TimelineEditorSample.Schema' TimelineEditorSample.SchemaLoader' TimelineEditorSample.Program' TimelineEditorSample.TimelineCommands' TimelineEditorSample.TimelineContext' TimelineEditorSample.TimelineEditor
Unstable Dependency,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): TimelineEditorSample,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.timelineRefType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Schema' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.eventType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.trackType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.markerType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.groupType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.timelineType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.intervalType' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.keyType
Feature Concentration,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [TimelineReference]' [Key' BaseEvent' Interval' Marker]' [Group]' [Timeline]' [Track]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.62,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Group' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Timeline' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Track
Scattered Functionality,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sce.Atf' Sce.Atf.Dom,Sce.Atf.Localizer' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomNodeType' Sce.Atf.TransactionContexts' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomNode' Sce.Atf.IFileWatcherService' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomXmlWriter
