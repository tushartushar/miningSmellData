Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters' TimelineEditorSample,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.SchemaLoader,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.SchemaLoader
Unstable Dependency,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters,TimelineEditorSample.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.Key' TimelineEditorSample.BaseEvent' TimelineEditorSample.Group' TimelineEditorSample.Interval' TimelineEditorSample.Marker' TimelineEditorSample.Timeline' TimelineEditorSample.Track,TimelineEditorSample.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.Key' TimelineEditorSample.BaseEvent' TimelineEditorSample.Group' TimelineEditorSample.Interval' TimelineEditorSample.Marker' TimelineEditorSample.Timeline' TimelineEditorSample.Track
Feature Concentration,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [TimelineReference]' [Key' BaseEvent' Interval' Marker' Timeline' Track' Group]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.TimelineReference,TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.TimelineReference' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Key' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.BaseEvent' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Group' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Interval' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Marker' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Timeline' TimelineEditorSample.DomNodeAdapters.Track
Scattered Functionality,TimelineEditor.vs2010,TimelineEditorSample,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sce.Atf' Sce.Atf.Dom,Sce.Atf.Localizer' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomNodeType' Sce.Atf.TransactionContexts' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomNode' Sce.Atf.IFileWatcherService' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomXmlWriter,Sce.Atf.Localizer' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomNodeType' Sce.Atf.TransactionContexts' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomNode' Sce.Atf.IFileWatcherService' Sce.Atf.Dom.DomXmlWriter
