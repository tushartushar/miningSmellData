Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Perforce,Connections,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\Connections.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitRecentConnections
Imperative Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Perforce,LoginDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\LoginDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetConnectionLabel
Unnecessary Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Perforce,IP4CommandResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\PerforceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ErrorList' Success' TaggedOutput
Unutilized Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Perforce,UriPaths,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\UriPaths.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Perforce,UsersList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\UsersList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateList
Imperative Abstraction,Sce.Atf.Perforce,WorkspaceList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\WorkspaceList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateList
Insufficient Modularization,Sce.Atf.Perforce,PerforceService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\PerforceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sce.Atf.Perforce,PerforceService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\PerforceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sce.Atf.Perforce,PerforceService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\PerforceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 126
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sce.Atf.Perforce,ConnectionManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\ConnectionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sce.Atf.Perforce.ConnectionManager' Sce.Atf.Perforce.Connections
Rebellious Hierarchy,Sce.Atf.Perforce,PerforceService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SonyWWS_ATF\Framework\Atf.Perforce\PerforceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdateCommand' UpdateCachedStatuses' BroadcastStatuses
