Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,GDataDB.Impl,Serializer<T>,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GDataDB,Order,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Order.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Descending' ColumnName
Unnecessary Abstraction,GDataDB,Query,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Query.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Start' Count' FreeQuery' StructuredQuery' Order
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Threading,LazyThreadSafetyMode,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Lazy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode' System.LazyThreadSafetyMode
Imperative Abstraction,System.Threading,Lazy<T>,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Lazy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Threading,Lazy<T>,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Lazy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Threading,Lazy<T>,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Lazy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: System.Threading.Lazy<T>' System.Lazy<T>
Unutilized Abstraction,System,LazyThreadSafetyMode,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Lazy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unutilized Abstraction,GDataDB.Linq.Impl,Query<T>,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Linq\Impl\Query.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GDataDB.Linq,ITableExtensions,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Linq\ITableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GDataDB.Impl,Database,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Impl\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GDataDB.Impl.Database' GDataDB.DatabaseClient
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GDataDB,DatabaseClient,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\DatabaseClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GDataDB.DatabaseClient' GDataDB.Impl.Database
Broken Modularization,GDataDB,Query,C:\repos\mausch_GDataDB\GDataDB\Query.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Start' Count' FreeQuery' StructuredQuery' Order
