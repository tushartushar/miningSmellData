Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,CustomersController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\Controllers\CustomersController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,CustomersController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\Controllers\CustomersController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Delete which is more interested in members of the type: SampleContext
Feature Envy,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,CustomersController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\Controllers\CustomersController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Generate which is more interested in members of the type: SampleContext
Unutilized Abstraction,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,OrdersController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\Controllers\OrdersController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\DomainModel\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Orders
Unnecessary Abstraction,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,Order,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\DomainModel\Order.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OrderId' OrderName' CustomerId' Customer
Deficient Encapsulation,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,SampleContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\SampleContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectionString
Deficient Encapsulation,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,SampleContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\SampleContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConnectionString
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApiClassic\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\DomainModel\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ODataReferentialConstraintSample.Customer' ODataReferentialConstraintSample.Order
