Unutilized Abstraction,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,OrdersController,C:\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApi\v4\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\Controllers\OrdersController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ODataReferentialConstraintSample,Order,C:\repos\OData_ODataSamples\WebApi\v4\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\ODataReferentialConstraintSample\DomainModel\Order.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OrderId' OrderName' CustomerId' Customer
