Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tracing.Realtime,RealtimeTraceListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.Realtime\content\net40\External\Diagnostics\Tracer\RealtimeTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tracing.Realtime,TraceEventInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.Realtime\content\net40\External\Diagnostics\Tracer\RealtimeTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EventType' Message' Source
Rebellious Hierarchy,Tracing.Realtime,RealtimeTraceListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.Realtime\content\net40\External\Diagnostics\Tracer\RealtimeTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write' WriteLine
