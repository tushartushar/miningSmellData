Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tracing,DiagnosticsTracerSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\DiagnosticsTracerSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Tracing,DiagnosticsTracerSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\DiagnosticsTracerSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: when_tracing_then_succeeds which is more interested in members of the type: TracerManager
Feature Envy,Tracing,DiagnosticsTracerSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\DiagnosticsTracerSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: when_tracing_with_dots_then_traces_to_all_listeners which is more interested in members of the type: TracerManager
Feature Envy,Tracing,DiagnosticsTracerSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\DiagnosticsTracerSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: when_tracing_activity_then_can_render_activity_as_string which is more interested in members of the type: TracerManager
Unutilized Abstraction,Tracing,Speed,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\Speed.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tracing,RealtimeSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\RealtimeSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Tracing,RealtimeSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\RealtimeSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RealtimeSpec (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\RealtimeSpec.cs' [23' 55])' RealtimeSpec (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\RealtimeSpec.cs' [61' 93])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tracing,TraceEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clariuslabs_NuTracer\Tracer.UnitTests\RealtimeSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EventType' Message' Source
