Unnecessary Abstraction,NUnitCheatSheet,TestCaseDataFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukewickstead_DOT-NET-on-Linux\DetailedExamples\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestCasesDataForTestCaseSourceTest
Unutilized Abstraction,NUnitCheatSheet,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukewickstead_DOT-NET-on-Linux\DetailedExamples\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NUnitCheatSheet,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukewickstead_DOT-NET-on-Linux\DetailedExamples\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CaseSourceTestData
Deficient Encapsulation,NUnitCheatSheet,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukewickstead_DOT-NET-on-Linux\DetailedExamples\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CaseSourceTestData
Insufficient Modularization,NUnitCheatSheet,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukewickstead_DOT-NET-on-Linux\DetailedExamples\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet\NUnitCheatSheet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
