Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,PCLMock.CodeGeneration,PCLMock.CodeGeneration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: PCLMock.CodeGeneration' PCLMock.CodeGeneration.Models,PCLMock.CodeGeneration.Context' PCLMock.CodeGeneration.IPlugin' PCLMock.CodeGeneration.XmlBasedGenerator' PCLMock.CodeGeneration.Models.Configuration
Unstable Dependency,PCLMock.CodeGeneration,PCLMock.CodeGeneration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): PCLMock' PCLMock.CodeGeneration.Models,PCLMock.CodeGeneration.MockBehavior' PCLMock.CodeGeneration.Configuration
Feature Concentration,PCLMock.CodeGeneration,PCLMock.CodeGeneration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Context' IPlugin' Language' LanguageExtensions' Generator' SyntaxNodeEqualityComparer' SyntaxGeneratorExtensions' XmlBasedGenerator]' [Extensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,PCLMock.CodeGeneration.Extensions
