Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphConsoleAppV3,AppModeConstants,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ClientId' ClientSecret' TenantName' TenantId' AuthString
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphConsoleAppV3,UserModeConstants,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TenantId' ClientId' AuthString
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphConsoleAppV3,GlobalConstants,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthString' ResourceUrl' GraphServiceObjectId
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphConsoleAppV3,AuthenticationHelper,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\AuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TokenForUser' TokenForApplication
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphConsoleAppV3,AuthenticationHelper,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\AuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TokenForUser' TokenForApplication
Broken Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,AppModeConstants,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ClientId' ClientSecret' TenantName' TenantId' AuthString
Insufficient Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Requests,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\GraphRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Requests,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\GraphRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Requests,F:\newReposMay17\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\GraphRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Requests' Program
