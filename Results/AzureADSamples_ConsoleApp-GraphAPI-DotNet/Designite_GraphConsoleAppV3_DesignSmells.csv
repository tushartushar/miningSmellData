Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphConsoleAppV3,AppModeConstants,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ClientSecret' TenantName' AuthString
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphConsoleAppV3,UserModeConstants,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthString
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphConsoleAppV3,GlobalConstants,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthString' ResourceUrl' GraphServiceObjectId' TenantId' ClientId
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphConsoleAppV3,AuthenticationHelper,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\AuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TokenForUser' TokenForApplication
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphConsoleAppV3,AuthenticationHelper,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\AuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TokenForUser' TokenForApplication
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,AuthenticationHelper,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\AuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphConsoleAppV3.AuthenticationHelper' GraphConsoleAppV3.Requests' GraphConsoleAppV3.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,AuthenticationHelper,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\AuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphConsoleAppV3.AuthenticationHelper' GraphConsoleAppV3.Requests' GraphConsoleAppV3.Program
Broken Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,GlobalConstants,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthString' ResourceUrl' GraphServiceObjectId' TenantId' ClientId
Insufficient Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Requests,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\GraphRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Requests,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\GraphRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphConsoleAppV3.Requests' GraphConsoleAppV3.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Requests,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\GraphRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphConsoleAppV3.Requests' GraphConsoleAppV3.Program' GraphConsoleAppV3.AuthenticationHelper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Program,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphConsoleAppV3.Program' GraphConsoleAppV3.Requests
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphConsoleAppV3,Program,C:\repos\AzureADSamples_ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\GraphConsoleAppV3\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphConsoleAppV3.Program' GraphConsoleAppV3.AuthenticationHelper' GraphConsoleAppV3.Requests
