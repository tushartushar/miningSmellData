Multifaceted Abstraction,GeographicLib,Geodesic,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Geodesic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Multifaceted Abstraction,GeographicLib,GeodesicLine,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\GeodesicLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.82
Duplicate Abstraction,GeographicLib,PolygonArea,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\PolygonArea.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PolygonArea[290' 311]' PolygonArea[361' 382]
Unutilized Abstraction,GeographicLib.Util,Inverse,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Util\Inverse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GeographicLib.Util,Planimeter,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Util\Planimeter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GeographicLib.Util,Direct,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Util\Direct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GeographicLib,GeodesicData,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\GeodesicData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lat1' lon1' azi1' lat2' lon2' azi2' s12' a12' m12' M12' M21' S12
Deficient Encapsulation,GeographicLib,Pair,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Pair.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: First' Second
Deficient Encapsulation,GeographicLib,PolygonResult,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\PolygonResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Num' Perimeter' Area
Insufficient Modularization,GeographicLib,Geodesic,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Geodesic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GeographicLib,Geodesic,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Geodesic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GeographicLib,Geodesic,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\Geodesic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Geodesic' GeodesicLine
Broken Modularization,GeographicLib,GeodesicMask,C:\repos\suryapratap_GeographicLib\GeographicLib\GeodesicMask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CAP_NONE' CAP_C1' CAP_C1p' CAP_C2' CAP_C3' CAP_C4' CAP_ALL' OUT_ALL' NONE' LATITUDE' LONGITUDE' AZIMUTH' DISTANCE' DISTANCE_IN' REDUCEDLENGTH' GEODESICSCALE' AREA' ALL
