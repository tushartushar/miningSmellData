Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,CHeaderToXML,EnumTokenComparer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  EnumTokenComparer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Main.cs' [1' 26])' ESCLParser (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\ESCLParser.cs' [1' 26])
Duplicate Abstraction,CHeaderToXML,EnumTokenComparer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  EnumTokenComparer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Main.cs' [4' 24])' Parser (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Parser.cs' [3' 23])' OptionValueCollection (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Options.cs' [8' 28])' ESCLParser (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\ESCLParser.cs' [4' 24])
Imperative Abstraction,CHeaderToXML,EntryPoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,CHeaderToXML,Parameter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\ESCLParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Type' Count' Flow
Feature Envy,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_opentk\Source\Converter\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
