Feature Envy,BitMiracle.TiffCP,Copier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libtiff.net\TiffCP\Copier.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: cpBiasedContig2Contig which is more interested in members of the type: Tiff
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.TiffCP,Copier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libtiff.net\TiffCP\Copier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_outtiled' m_tilewidth' m_tilelength' m_config' m_compression' m_predictor' m_fillorder' m_rowsperstrip' m_g3opts' m_ignore' m_defg3opts' m_defcompression' m_defpredictor' m_bias' m_pageNum' m_pageInSeq
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.TiffCP,tagToCopy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libtiff.net\TiffCP\Copier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tag' count' type
Insufficient Modularization,BitMiracle.TiffCP,Copier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libtiff.net\TiffCP\Copier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,BitMiracle.TiffCP,Copier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libtiff.net\TiffCP\Copier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 218
