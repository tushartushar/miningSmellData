Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,IntPointDirectionSorter,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\DirectionSorter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PolygonAndPointDirectionSorter,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\DirectionSorter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,IPathNode,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\IPathNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IPathNode (C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\IPathNode.cs' [1' 21])' PathLink (C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\PathLink.cs' [1' 21])
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,NodeExtensions,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\IntPointPathing\IntPointNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,NodeExtensions,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\IntPointPathing\IntPointNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathFinder,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\PathFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CalculatedPath
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathFinder,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\PathFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CalculatedPath
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathLink,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\PathLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: nodeA' nodeB
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,IPathNode,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\IPathNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.Pathfinding.IPathNode' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.PathLink
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathLink,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\PathLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.Pathfinding.PathLink' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.IPathNode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,IntPointPathNetwork,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\IntPointPathing\IntPointPathNetwork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.Pathfinding.IntPointPathNetwork' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.WayPointsToRemove
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,WayPointsToRemove,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\IntPointPathing\IntPointPathNetwork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
