Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\Interfaces\PathLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: nodeA' nodeB
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathFinder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\PathFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CalculatedPath
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,PathFinder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\Pathfinding\PathFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CalculatedPath
