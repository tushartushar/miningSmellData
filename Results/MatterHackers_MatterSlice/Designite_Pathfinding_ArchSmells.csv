Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Pathfinding,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: MatterHackers.Pathfinding' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.Datastructures,MatterHackers.Pathfinding.IntPointDirectionSorter' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.PathFinder' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.IntPointPathNetwork' MatterHackers.Pathfinding.Datastructures.AStarStack
Unstable Dependency,Pathfinding,MatterHackers.Pathfinding.Datastructures,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MatterHackers.Pathfinding,MatterHackers.Pathfinding.Datastructures.IPathNode
Feature Concentration,Pathfinding,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IntPointDirectionSorter]' [PolygonAndPointDirectionSorter]' [PathFinder' IntPointNode' IntPointPathNetwork' WayPointsToRemove' PathStatus' Path' IPathNetwork' IPathNode' IPoint' PathLink' NodeExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.23,MatterHackers.Pathfinding.PolygonAndPointDirectionSorter
Scattered Functionality,Pathfinding,MatterHackers.Pathfinding,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: MSClipperLib' MatterHackers.QuadTree,MSClipperLib.Clipper' MSClipperLib.CLPolygonsExtensions' MatterHackers.QuadTree.QTPolygonsExtensions' MatterHackers.QuadTree.QTPolygonExtensions' MSClipperLib.IntPointExtensions
