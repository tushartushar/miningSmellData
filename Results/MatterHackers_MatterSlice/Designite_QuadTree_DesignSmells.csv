Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.QuadTree,Branch<T>,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\QuadTree\Branch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MatterHackers.QuadTree,Leaf<T>,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\QuadTree\Branch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Quad' ContainingBranch' Value

Insufficient Modularization,MatterHackers.QuadTree,QTPolygonExtensions,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\QuadTree\PolygonExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.QuadTree,QTPolygonExtensions,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterSlice\QuadTree\PolygonExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.QuadTree.QTPolygonExtensions' MatterHackers.QuadTree.QTPolygonsExtensions
