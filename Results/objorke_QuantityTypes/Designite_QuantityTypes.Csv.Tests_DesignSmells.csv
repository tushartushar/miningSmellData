Unnecessary Abstraction,QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests,TestObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\objorke_QuantityTypes\Source\QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests\CsvFileTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Length' NullableLength' Number' Text
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests,CsvTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\objorke_QuantityTypes\Source\QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests\CsvTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests,CsvWriterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\objorke_QuantityTypes\Source\QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests\CsvWriterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests,CultureInfos,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\objorke_QuantityTypes\Source\QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests\CultureInfos.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Norwegian
Deficient Encapsulation,QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests,CsvParserTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\objorke_QuantityTypes\Source\QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests\CsvParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestString1
Deficient Encapsulation,QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests,CsvParserTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\objorke_QuantityTypes\Source\QuantityTypes.Csv.Tests\CsvParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields.
