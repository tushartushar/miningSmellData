Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests,TestConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Contrib\tests\ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests\AllCacheClientsTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SingleHost' MasterHosts
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests,MemoryCacheClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Contrib\tests\ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests\MemoryCacheClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests,MemoryCacheClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Contrib\tests\ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests\MemoryCacheClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests,AllCacheClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Contrib\tests\ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests\AllCacheClientTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStack.Caching.Memcached.Tests.AllCacheClientsTestBase
