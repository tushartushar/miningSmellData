Feature Envy,ServiceStack.ServiceClient.Web,AsyncServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Contrib\src\ServiceStack.Client\AsyncServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleResponseError which is more interested in members of the type: ILog
