Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,UserPreferences,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\IEGUIFacade.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' lastBinderClassName' lastHRFFact' lastHRFQuery
Unutilized Abstraction,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,AssemblyNameSorter,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,IEGUIConsoleTraceListener,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\IEGUIConsoleTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,UserPreferences,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\IEGUIFacade.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lastBinderClassName' lastHRFFact' lastHRFQuery
Insufficient Modularization,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,MainForm,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,MainForm,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console.MainForm' NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console.IEGUIFacade
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console,IEGUIFacade,C:\repos\ddossot_NxBRE\IE-Console\IE-Console\IEGUIFacade.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console.IEGUIFacade' NxBRE.InferenceEngine.Console.MainForm
