Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,CollisionFX,CollisionFX,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Unutilized Abstraction,CollisionFX,AutoStartup,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CollisionFX,EvaWatcher,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\EvaWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CollisionFX,CollisionFX,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConfigPath' volume' scrapeSparks' collisionSound' wheelImpactSound' scrapeSound' sparkSound' sparkLightIntensity' minScrapeSpeed' pitchRange' scrapeFadeSpeed
Deficient Encapsulation,CollisionFX,CollisionFX,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConfigPath
Deficient Encapsulation,CollisionFX,AutoStartup,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: first
Deficient Encapsulation,CollisionFX,AutoStartup,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: first
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CollisionFX,CollisionFX,C:\repos\pizzaoverhead_CollisionFX\CollisionFX\CollisionFX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CollisionFX' ColourManager
