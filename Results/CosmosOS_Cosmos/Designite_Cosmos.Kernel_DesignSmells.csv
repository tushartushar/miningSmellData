Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Kernel,AddressSpace,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\AddressSpace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Offset' Size
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Kernel,PageDirectoryEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\KPaging\PagingStructs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PDEValue
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Kernel,PageTableEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\KPaging\PagingStructs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PTEValue
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Kernel.ManagedMemory,ManagedUInt32Array,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\ManagedMemory\ManagedUInt32Array.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Address
Insufficient Modularization,Cosmos.Kernel,MemoryAddressSpace,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\MemoryAddressSpace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Modularization,Cosmos.Kernel,PageDirectoryEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\KPaging\PagingStructs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PageTableAddress' Available1' Available0' LargePages' Accessed' CacheDisabled' WriteThrough' UserAccess' ReadOnly' Present' PDEValue
Broken Modularization,Cosmos.Kernel,PageTableEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\KPaging\PagingStructs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PhysicalAddress' Available1' Available0' Global' Dirty' Accessed' CacheDisabled' WriteThrough' UserAccess' ReadOnly' Present' PTEValue
Rebellious Hierarchy,Cosmos.Kernel,IOAddressSpace,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\IOAddressSpace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Read64' Read64Unchecked' Write64' Write64Unchecked
Broken Hierarchy,Cosmos.Kernel,ManagedMemorySpace,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Archive\Cosmos.Kernel\ManagedMemorySpace.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cosmos.Kernel.MemoryAddressSpace
