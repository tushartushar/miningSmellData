Insufficient Modularization,Orvid.Compression,LZMAEncoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Tools\TTF2OPFF Converter\LZMACoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Orvid.Compression,LZMAEncoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Tools\TTF2OPFF Converter\LZMACoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 179
Broken Hierarchy,Orvid.Compression,LenPriceTableEncoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Tools\TTF2OPFF Converter\LZMACoder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Orvid.Compression.LenEncoder
Broken Hierarchy,Orvid.Compression,IMatchFinder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Tools\TTF2OPFF Converter\LZMACoder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Orvid.Compression.IInWindowStream
Broken Hierarchy,Orvid.Compression,LZBinTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Tools\TTF2OPFF Converter\LZMACoder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Orvid.Compression.LZInWindow
