Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,InstructionEnum,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\InstructionEnum.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,InstructionRequirement,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\InstructionRequirement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,InstructionRequirement,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\InstructionRequirement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,InstructionSet,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\InstructionSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,InstructionVariant,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\InstructionVariant.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,Operand,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\Operand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,Registers,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\Registers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,InstructionVariant,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\InstructionVariant.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NasmData' NeedsModRMByte' InitialModRMByteValue' ReverseRegisters' AllowedSizes' DefaultSize
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,Operand,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\Operand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BaseRegister' RegisterSize' RegisterGroup' RegisterByte' RegisterBitShiftLeft' Type' ImmediateSize
Insufficient Modularization,Cosmos.Assembler.X86,Registers,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Gero Landmann\Cosmos.Assembler.X86.Gero\Registers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
