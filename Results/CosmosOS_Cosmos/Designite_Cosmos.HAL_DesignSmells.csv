Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.HAL,Boot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Kernel-X86\30-HAL\Cosmos.HAL\Boot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cosmos.HAL,Globals,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Kernel-X86\30-HAL\Cosmos.HAL\Globals.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DeviceMgr

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.HAL,Globals,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Kernel-X86\30-HAL\Cosmos.HAL\Globals.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DeviceMgr
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.HAL,Globals,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Kernel-X86\30-HAL\Cosmos.HAL\Globals.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DeviceMgr
