Unutilized Abstraction,TestRunner,TestRunnerKernel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Orvid\TestRunner\Kernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TestRunner,TestRunnerKernel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Orvid\TestRunner\Kernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: log
Insufficient Modularization,TestRunner,TestRunnerKernel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Orvid\TestRunner\Kernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 404
Rebellious Hierarchy,TestRunner,TestRunnerKernel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Orvid\TestRunner\Kernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BeforeRun
