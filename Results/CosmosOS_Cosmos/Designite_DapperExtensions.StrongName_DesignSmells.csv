Insufficient Modularization,DapperExtensions,IDatabase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Resources\Dependencies\DapperExtensions.StrongName\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DapperExtensions,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Resources\Dependencies\DapperExtensions.StrongName\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DapperExtensions,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Resources\Dependencies\DapperExtensions.StrongName\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
