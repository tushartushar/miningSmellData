Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,OpCodeEnum,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,ILReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\ILReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,ILReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\ILReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,ILStreamPositionReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\ILStreamPositionReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,Reader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Reader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,LogItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Reader.ScanLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SrcType' Item
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionToEcmaCil,LogItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Reader.ScanLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ReflectionToEcmaCil,LogItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Reader.ScanLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SrcType' Item
Insufficient Modularization,ReflectionToEcmaCil,Reader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Reader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 161
Missing Hierarchy,ReflectionToEcmaCil,Reader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\Users\Matthijs\Testing\ReflectionToEcmaCil\Reader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: QueuedMethod' QueuedArrayType (in method "Execute" of class "Reader").
