Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Cosmos.Build.Common,BochsSupport,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\BochsSupport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExtractBochsDebugSymbols
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Build.Common,Architecture,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Build.Common,LogSeverityEnum,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Build.Common,EnumHelper,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.Build.Common,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Build.Common,BuildProperties,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\BuildProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PropNames
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Build.Common,BuildProperties,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\BuildProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PropNames
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Build.Common,CosmosPaths,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\CosmosPaths.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DebugStubSrc
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.Build.Common,CosmosPaths,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\CosmosPaths.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DebugStubSrc
Broken Modularization,Cosmos.Build.Common,BuildPropertyNames,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\BuildPropertyNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' StackCorruptionDetectionEnabledString' StackCorruptionDetectionLevelString' ProfileString' NameString' DescriptionString' DeploymentString' LaunchString' ShowLaunchConsoleString' DebugEnabledString' DebugModeString' IgnoreDebugStubAttributeString' CosmosDebugPortString' VisualStudioDebugPortString' PxeInterfaceString' SlavePortString' VMwareEditionString' OutputPathString' FrameworkString' UseInternalAssemblerString' TraceAssembliesString' EnableGDBString' StartCosmosGDBString' EnableBochsDebugString' StartBochsDebugGui' BinFormatString
Broken Hierarchy,Cosmos.Build.Common,BuildProperties,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.Build.Common\BuildProperties.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cosmos.Build.Common.PropertiesBase
