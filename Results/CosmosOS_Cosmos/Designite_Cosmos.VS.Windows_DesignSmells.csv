Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cosmos.VS.Windows,AsmLine,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\AsmLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cosmos.VS.Windows,ConsoleConsts,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ConsoleConsts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Channel' Command_WriteText
Unutilized Abstraction,Cosmos.VS.Windows,ConsoleUC,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ConsoleUC.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Cosmos.VS.Windows,AssemblyUC,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\AssemblyUC.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: AsmLabel' AsmLabel' AsmComment (in method "Display" of class "AssemblyUC").
Unexploited Encapsulation,Cosmos.VS.Windows,AssemblyUC,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\AssemblyUC.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: AsmLabel' AsmCode (in method "Display" of class "AssemblyUC").
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.VS.Windows,Global,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PipeUp' OutputPane' ConsoleTextChannel
Deficient Encapsulation,Cosmos.VS.Windows,Global,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PipeUp' OutputPane' ConsoleTextChannel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cosmos.VS.Windows,CosmosMenuCmdSet,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\CosmosMenuCmdSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cosmos.VS.Windows.CosmosMenuCmdSet' Cosmos.VS.Windows.CosmosWindowsPackage
Broken Modularization,Cosmos.VS.Windows,Guids,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PackageGuidString' CosmosMenuGuidString' AsmToolbarGuidString' IDEToolbarGuidString' ImagesGuidString' AsmToolbarCmdSetString' CosmosMenuCmdSetString' IDEToolbarCmdSetString' CosmosMenuCmdSetGuid' AsmToolbarCmdSetGuid' IDEToolbarCmdSetGuid
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cosmos.VS.Windows,CosmosWindowsPackage,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\CosmosWindowsPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cosmos.VS.Windows.CosmosWindowsPackage' Cosmos.VS.Windows.CosmosMenuCmdSet
Unfactored Hierarchy,Cosmos.VS.Windows,InternalTW,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\InternalUC.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  InternalTW (C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\InternalUC.xaml.cs' [1' 21])' RegistersTW (C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\RegistersUC.xaml.cs' [1' 21])' StackTW (C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\StackUC.xaml.cs' [1' 21])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Cosmos.VS.Windows,RegistersTW,C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\RegistersUC.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  RegistersTW (C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\RegistersUC.xaml.cs' [1' 26])' StackTW (C:\repos\CosmosOS_Cosmos\source\Cosmos.VS.Windows\ToolWindows\StackUC.xaml.cs' [1' 26])
