Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioSample,GameAppDelegate,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\GameAppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,AudioSample,AudioSlider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\GameLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AudioSlider which is more interested in members of the type: CCControlSlider
Duplicate Abstraction,CocosSharp,CCControlEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CCControlEvent (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControl.cs' [5' 27])' CCControlSlider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlSlider.cs' [5' 27])
Duplicate Abstraction,CocosSharp,CCControlEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CCControlEvent (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControl.cs' [5' 24])' CCControlSwitch (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlSwitch.cs' [5' 24])' RGBA (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlUtils.cs' [8' 27])' CCControlSlider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlSlider.cs' [5' 24])
Feature Envy,CocosSharp,CCControlColourPicker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlColourPicker.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CCControlColourPicker which is more interested in members of the type: HSV
Unnecessary Abstraction,CocosSharp,RGBA,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' R' G' B' A
Unnecessary Abstraction,CocosSharp,HSV,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' H' S' V
Deficient Encapsulation,CocosSharp,RGBA,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: R' G' B' A
Deficient Encapsulation,CocosSharp,HSV,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCControlUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: H' S' V
Insufficient Modularization,CocosSharp,CCScale9Sprite,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCScale9Sprite.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Hierarchy,CocosSharp,CCScale9SpriteFile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCScale9SpriteFile.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CocosSharp.CCScale9Sprite
Broken Hierarchy,CocosSharp,CCScale9SpriteFrame,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\AudioSample\AudioSample\AudioSample.Common\Extensions\GUI\CCControlExtension\CCScale9SpriteFrame.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CocosSharp.CCScale9Sprite
