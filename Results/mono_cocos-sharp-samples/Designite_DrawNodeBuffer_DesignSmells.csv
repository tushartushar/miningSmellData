Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DrawNodeBuffer,AppDelegate,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DrawNodeBuffer,DrawNodeBuffer,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DrawNodeBuffer (C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs' [147' 175])' DrawNodeBuffer (C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs' [198' 226])
Duplicate Abstraction,DrawNodeBuffer,DrawNodeBuffer,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DrawNodeBuffer (C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs' [549' 569])' DrawNodeBuffer (C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs' [574' 594])
Unnecessary Abstraction,DrawNodeBuffer,ExtrudeVerts,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' offset' n
Imperative Abstraction,DrawNodeBuffer,IntroLayer,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\IntroLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnEnter
Deficient Encapsulation,DrawNodeBuffer,ExtrudeVerts,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: offset' n
Insufficient Modularization,DrawNodeBuffer,DrawNodeBuffer,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DrawNodeBuffer,DrawNodeBuffer,C:\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer\DrawNodeBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
