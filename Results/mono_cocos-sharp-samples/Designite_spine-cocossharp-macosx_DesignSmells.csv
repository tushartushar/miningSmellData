Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,spine_cocossharp,GoblinLayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\GoblinLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Duplicate Abstraction,spine_cocossharp,GoblinLayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\GoblinLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GoblinLayer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\GoblinLayer.cs' [201' 223])' SpineBoyLayer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\SpineBoyLayer.cs' [149' 171])
Feature Envy,spine_cocossharp,GoblinLayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\GoblinLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GoblinLayer which is more interested in members of the type: CCSkeletonAnimation
Multifaceted Abstraction,spine_cocossharp,SpineBoyLayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\SpineBoyLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,spine_cocossharp,GoblinLayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cocos-sharp-samples\Spine\example\Common\src\GoblinLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: spine_cocossharp.GoblinLayer' spine_cocossharp.SpineBoyLayer
