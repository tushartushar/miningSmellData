Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,SharpChess.Model.Tests,SharpChess.Model.Tests,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BestMoveTests]' [GameTest]' [HashTableCheckTest]' [MovesTest]' [PieceTests]' [PlayerTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,SharpChess.Model.Tests.GameTest' SharpChess.Model.Tests.HashTableCheckTest' SharpChess.Model.Tests.MovesTest' SharpChess.Model.Tests.PieceTests' SharpChess.Model.Tests.PlayerTest,SharpChess.Model.Tests.BestMoveTests' SharpChess.Model.Tests.GameTest' SharpChess.Model.Tests.HashTableCheckTest' SharpChess.Model.Tests.MovesTest' SharpChess.Model.Tests.PieceTests' SharpChess.Model.Tests.PlayerTest
Scattered Functionality,SharpChess.Model.Tests,SharpChess.Model.Tests,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: SharpChess.Model.AI' SharpChess.Model,SharpChess.Model.AI.KillerMoves' SharpChess.Model.Board' SharpChess.Model.Move,SharpChess.Model.AI.KillerMoves' SharpChess.Model.Board' SharpChess.Model.Move
