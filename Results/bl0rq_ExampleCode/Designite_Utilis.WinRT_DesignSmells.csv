Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Utilis.UI,NavigationCommand,C:\repos\bl0rq_ExampleCode\Source\Utilis.WinRT\UI\Navigation\NavigationCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NavigationCommand' Start' ServiceLocator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Utilis.UI,NavigationCommand,C:\repos\bl0rq_ExampleCode\Source\Utilis.WinRT\UI\Navigation\NavigationCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NavigationCommand' Start' Bootstrapper' App' ServiceLocator
Broken Hierarchy,Utilis.UI,NavigationCommandAutoCreate,C:\repos\bl0rq_ExampleCode\Source\Utilis.WinRT\UI\Navigation\NavigationCommand.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NavigationCommand
