Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Feature Concentration,Kafka.Performance.Common,NDesk.Options,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [OptionValueCollection' OptionContext' OptionValueType' Option' OptionSet]' [OptionException]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.38  All the dependencies among components: from: Kafka.Performance.Common' to: NDesk.Options' from: Kafka.Client.Admin' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Client.Admin' to: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' from: Kafka.Client.Api' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Api' to: Kafka.Client.Common' from: Kafka.Client.Api' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Client.Api' to: Kafka.Client.Clusters' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Sections' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Elements' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Common' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Clusters' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Serializers' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Metrics' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Network' from: Kafka.Client.Consumers' to: Kafka.Client.Extensions' from: Kafka.Client.Extensions' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Metrics' to: Kafka.Client.Common' from: Kafka.Client.Metrics' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Producers' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Sections' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Serializers' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' to: Kafka.Client.Common' from: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Sections' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Elements' from: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Sections' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg' from: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Sections' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Sections' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg.Elements' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Clusters' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Client' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Common' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Producers.Async' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Metrics' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Client.Producers' to: Kafka.Client.Network' from: Kafka.Client.Client' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Client' to: Kafka.Client.Producers' from: Kafka.Client.Client' to: Kafka.Client.Clusters' from: Kafka.Client.Client' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg' from: Kafka.Client.Clusters' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Clusters' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Messages' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Messages' to: Kafka.Client.Serializers' from: Kafka.Client.Network' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Network' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Serializers' to: Kafka.Client.Producers' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Common' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Clusters' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Consumers' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Api' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Server' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Client.Utils' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Client.Utils' to: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' from: Kafka.Client.Utils' to: Kafka.Client.Clusters' from: Kafka.Client.Utils' to: Kafka.Client.Consumers' from: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' to: Kafka.Client.ZKClient.Serialize' from: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' to: Kafka.Client.ZKClient.Exceptions' from: Kafka.Client.ZKClient' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Performance.Producer' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Performance.Producer' to: Kafka.Client.Messages' from: Kafka.Performance.Producer' to: NDesk.Options' from: Kafka.Performance.Producer' to: Kafka.Client.Metrics' from: Kafka.Performance.Producer' to: Kafka.Client.Producers' from: Kafka.Performance.Producer' to: Kafka.Client.Cfg' from: Kafka.Performance.Consumer' to: Kafka.Client.Common.Imported' from: Kafka.Performance.Consumer' to: Kafka.Client.Utils' from: Kafka.Performance.Consumer' to: Kafka.Client.Consumers' from: Kafka.Performance.Consumer' to: NDesk.Options.
