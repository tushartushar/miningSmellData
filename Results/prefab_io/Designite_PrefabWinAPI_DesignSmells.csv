Deficient Encapsulation,PrefabWinAPI,Win32,C:\repos\prefab_io\Win32\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HWND_TOP
Deficient Encapsulation,PrefabWinAPI,Win32,C:\repos\prefab_io\Win32\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: HWND_TOP
Insufficient Modularization,PrefabWinAPI,Win32,C:\repos\prefab_io\Win32\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 97 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PrefabWinAPI,Win32,C:\repos\prefab_io\Win32\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 103 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PrefabWinAPI,Win32,C:\repos\prefab_io\Win32\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
