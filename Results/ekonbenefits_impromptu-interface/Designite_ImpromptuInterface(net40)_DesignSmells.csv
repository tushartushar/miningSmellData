Unnecessary Abstraction,ImpromptuInterface,NonRecursiveInterfaceAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\Attributes\NonRecursiveInterfaceAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImpromptuInterface,UseNamedArgumentAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\Attributes\UseNamedArgumentAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImpromptuInterface,IActLikeProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\IActLikeProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Original
Duplicate Abstraction,ImpromptuInterface.Build,CompatHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\BuildProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CompatHelper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\BuildProxy.cs' [997' 1016])' CompatHelper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\BuildProxy.cs' [1109' 1128])
Unutilized Abstraction,ImpromptuInterface.Build,EmitExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\EmitExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImpromptuInterface.Optimization,BareBonesList<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\Optimization\BareBonesList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ImpromptuInterface.Build,ActLikeProxySerializationHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\ActLikeProxySerializationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Original' Interfaces' MonoInterfaces' Context
Insufficient Modularization,ImpromptuInterface.Build,BuildProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\BuildProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ImpromptuInterface.Build,BuildProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\BuildProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Insufficient Modularization,ImpromptuInterface.Build,EmitExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\EmitExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImpromptuInterface,ActLikeCaster,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\ActLikeCaster.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImpromptuInterface.ActLikeCaster' ImpromptuInterface.Impromptu
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImpromptuInterface.Build,ActLikeProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\EmitProxy\ActLikeProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImpromptuInterface.Build.ActLikeProxy' ImpromptuInterface.Build.BuildProxy' ImpromptuInterface.Build.ActLikeProxySerializationHelper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImpromptuInterface,Impromptu,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\Impromptu.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImpromptuInterface.Impromptu' ImpromptuInterface.Build.ActLikeProxySerializationHelper' ImpromptuInterface.Build.ActLikeProxy' ImpromptuInterface.Build.BuildProxy
Broken Hierarchy,ImpromptuInterface.Optimization,GenericBinderHashBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\Optimization\BinderHash.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ImpromptuInterface.Optimization.BinderHash
Missing Hierarchy,ImpromptuInterface.Optimization,BinderHash<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_impromptu-interface\ImpromptuInterface\src\Optimization\BinderHash.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: GenericBinderHashBase' BinderHash (in method "Equals" of class "BinderHash<T>").
