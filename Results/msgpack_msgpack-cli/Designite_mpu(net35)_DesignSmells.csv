Imperative Abstraction,mpu,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Imperative Abstraction,mpu,SerializerTargetCompiler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\SerializerTargetCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CompileTargetTypeAssembly
Feature Envy,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 114
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.OptionValueCollection' Mono.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,Option,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.Option' Mono.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.OptionSet' Mono.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.OptionValueCollection' Mono.Options.OptionSet' Mono.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.OptionValueCollection' Mono.Options.OptionContext' Mono.Options.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.OptionContext' Mono.Options.OptionSet' Mono.Options.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Options.OptionValueCollection' Mono.Options.OptionSet' Mono.Options.OptionContext' Mono.Options.Option
Cyclic Hierarchy,mpu,PathEqualityComparer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\PathEqualityComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: OrdinalPathEqualityComparer
Cyclic Hierarchy,Mono.Options,Option,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Category
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mono.Options,Category,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\src\mpu\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
