Unutilized Abstraction,MsgPack.Tools.Build,GlobJsonConverter,C:\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\tools\SyncProjects2\MsgPack.Tools.Build.SyncProject\Tools\Build\GlobJsonConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MsgPack.Tools.Build,ProjectSynchronizationDefinition,C:\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\tools\SyncProjects2\MsgPack.Tools.Build.SyncProject\Tools\Build\ProjectSynchronizationDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ProjectSynchronizationDefinition (C:\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\tools\SyncProjects2\MsgPack.Tools.Build.SyncProject\Tools\Build\ProjectSynchronizationDefinition.cs' [1' 22])' ProjectSynchronizer (C:\repos\msgpack_msgpack-cli\tools\SyncProjects2\MsgPack.Tools.Build.SyncProject\Tools\Build\ProjectSynchronizer.cs' [1' 22])
