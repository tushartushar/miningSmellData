Feature Envy,NBitcoin.Bench,Serialization,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NicolasDorier_NBitcoin\NBitcoin.Bench\Serialization.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SerializeBigBlock which is more interested in members of the type: BlockSample
Deficient Encapsulation,NBitcoin.Bench,BlockSample,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NicolasDorier_NBitcoin\NBitcoin.Bench\BlockSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
