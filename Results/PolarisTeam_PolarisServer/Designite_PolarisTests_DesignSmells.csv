Unutilized Abstraction,PolarisTests,ReflectionTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PolarisTeam_PolarisServer\PolarisTests\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PolarisTests,UnsafeTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PolarisTeam_PolarisServer\PolarisTests\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PolarisTests,WriterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PolarisTeam_PolarisServer\PolarisTests\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PolarisTests,WriterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PolarisTeam_PolarisServer\PolarisTests\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestStructureWrite which is more interested in members of the type: PacketWriter
