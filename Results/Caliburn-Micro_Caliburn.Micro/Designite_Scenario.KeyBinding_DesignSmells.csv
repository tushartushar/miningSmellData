Unutilized Abstraction,Scenario.KeyBinding,Bootstrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Caliburn-Micro_Caliburn.Micro\samples\scenarios\Scenario.KeyBinding\Bootstrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Scenario.KeyBinding.Views,ShellView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Caliburn-Micro_Caliburn.Micro\samples\scenarios\Scenario.KeyBinding\Views\ShellView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scenario.KeyBinding.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Caliburn-Micro_Caliburn.Micro\samples\scenarios\Scenario.KeyBinding\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Caliburn-Micro_Caliburn.Micro\samples\scenarios\Scenario.KeyBinding\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
