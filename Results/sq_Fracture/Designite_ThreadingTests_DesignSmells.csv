Unutilized Abstraction,Squared.Threading,FutureTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\FutureTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Squared.Threading,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\FutureTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Property' Field
Unnecessary Abstraction,Squared.Threading,TestStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\FutureTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Property' Field
Unutilized Abstraction,Squared.Threading,ThreadGroupTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\ThreadGroupTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Threading,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\FutureTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Field
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Threading,TestStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\FutureTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Field
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Threading,TestWorkItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\ThreadGroupTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Ran
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Threading,SleepyWorkItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\ThreadGroupTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Ran
Insufficient Modularization,Squared.Threading,FutureTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\FutureTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Squared.Threading,VoidWorkItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\ThreadingTests\ThreadGroupTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
