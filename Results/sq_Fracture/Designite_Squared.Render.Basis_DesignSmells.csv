Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Squared.Render.Basis,BlockFormats,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Squared.Render.Basis,ImageLevel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetTranscodedSizeInBytes which is more interested in members of the type: BasisFile
Feature Envy,Squared.Render.Basis,ImageLevel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TryTranscode which is more interested in members of the type: BasisFile
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Render.Basis,ImageInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: image_index' total_levels' orig_width' orig_height' width' height' num_blocks_x' num_blocks_y' total_blocks' first_slice_index' alpha_flag' iframe_flag

Broken Modularization,Squared.Render.Basis,ImageInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' image_index' total_levels' orig_width' orig_height' width' height' num_blocks_x' num_blocks_y' total_blocks' first_slice_index' alpha_flag' iframe_flag

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' image_index' level_index' orig_width' orig_height' width' height' num_blocks_x' num_blocks_y' total_blocks' first_slice_index' alpha_flag' iframe_flag
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Squared.Render.Basis,BasisFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Squared.Render.Basis.BasisFile' Squared.Render.Basis.Image
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Squared.Render.Basis,ImageLevel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.Basis\Basis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Squared.Render.Basis.ImageLevel' Squared.Render.Basis.Image
