Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Squared.Render,EmbeddedTexture2DProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\EmbeddedTextureProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Squared.Render.STB.Native,STBI_IO_Callbacks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' read' skip' eof
Unutilized Abstraction,Squared.Render.STB,ImagePrecision,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\STBI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Squared.Render.STB,ImageChannels,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\STBI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Render,TextureLoadOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\EmbeddedTextureProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Premultiply' FloatingPoint' GenerateMips' PadToPowerOfTwo' Palette' PaletteTextureHeight' PaletteTexture' Width' Height
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Render.STB.Native,STBI_IO_Callbacks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: read' skip' eof
Deficient Encapsulation,Squared.Render.STB,Image,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\STBI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Width' Height' ChannelCount
Broken Modularization,Squared.Render,TextureLoadOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\EmbeddedTextureProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Premultiply' FloatingPoint' GenerateMips' PadToPowerOfTwo' Palette' PaletteTextureHeight' PaletteTexture' Width' Height
Insufficient Modularization,Squared.Render.STB.Native,API,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Render.STB\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
