Wide Hierarchy,Squared.Util,IRefComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_Fracture\Squared\Util\Sort.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Squared.Render.BatchTypeSorter' Squared.Render.MultimaterialComparer' Squared.Render.BitmapDrawCallSorterComparer' Squared.Render.BitmapDrawCallOrderAndTextureComparer' Squared.Render.BitmapDrawCallTextureComparer' Squared.Render.GeometryDrawCallSorter' Squared.Render.BatchComparer' Squared.Render.PrimitiveDrawCallComparer<T>' Squared.Render.RasterShape.RasterShapeTypeSorter' Squared.Util.PoolEntryComparer' Squared.Util.RefComparerAdapter' Squared.Util.DeclarativeSort.SorterComparer
