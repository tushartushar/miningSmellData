Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Squared.Game.SDL2,Squared.Game,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Squared.Game' Squared.Game.Serialization,Squared.Game.Geometry' Squared.Game.TypeResolverChain' Squared.Game.Serialization.NameReplacementTypeResolver' Squared.Game.Serialization.SerializationExtensions
Unstable Dependency,Squared.Game.SDL2,Squared.Game.Serialization,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Squared.Game,Squared.Game.Serialization.INamedObject' Squared.Game.Serialization.Bounds
God Component,Squared.Game.SDL2,Squared.Game,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 39,Squared.Game.IHasBounds3' Squared.Game.Edge' Squared.Game.IHasAnchor' Squared.Game.IHasBounds' Squared.Game.ResolvedMotion' Squared.Game.INamedObject' Squared.Game.ITypeSerializer' Squared.Game.ISpatialPartitionSector' Squared.Game.SerializationContext' Squared.Game.RWContextBase
Feature Concentration,Squared.Game.SDL2,Squared.Game.Animation,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AnimCmd' SetAnimation' SetFrame' Delay' WaitForUpdate' Animator]' [AnimationExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29,Squared.Game.Animation.AnimationExtensions
