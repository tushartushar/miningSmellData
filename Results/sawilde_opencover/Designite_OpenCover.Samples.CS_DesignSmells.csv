Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCover.Samples.CS,TryExceptionTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sawilde_opencover\samples\OpenCover.Samples.CS\TryExceptionTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,OpenCover.Samples.CS,TryExceptionTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sawilde_opencover\samples\OpenCover.Samples.CS\TryExceptionTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TryException which is more interested in members of the type: ITestExceptionQuery
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCover.Samples.CS,TryFinallyTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sawilde_opencover\samples\OpenCover.Samples.CS\TryFinallyTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
