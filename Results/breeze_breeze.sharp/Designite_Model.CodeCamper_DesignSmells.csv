Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Model.CodeCamper,Room,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,Model.CodeCamper,TimeSlot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Start' IsSessionSlot' Duration
Unnecessary Abstraction,Model.CodeCamper,Track,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unutilized Abstraction,Model.CodeCamper,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Model.CodeCamper,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' FirstName' LastName' Email' Blog' Twitter' Gender' ImageSource' SpeakerSessions
Broken Modularization,Model.CodeCamper,Session,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Title' Code' Description' Level' Tags' RoomId' SpeakerId' TimeSlotId' TrackId' Room' Speaker' TimeSlot' Track
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Model.CodeCamper,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Model.CodeCamper.Person' Model.CodeCamper.Session
Broken Hierarchy,Model.CodeCamper,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Breeze.Sharp.BaseEntity
Broken Hierarchy,Model.CodeCamper,Session,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Breeze.Sharp.BaseEntity
Broken Hierarchy,Model.CodeCamper,Room,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Breeze.Sharp.BaseEntity
Broken Hierarchy,Model.CodeCamper,TimeSlot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.CodeCamper\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Breeze.Sharp.BaseEntity
