Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Model.Edmunds,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Model.Edmunds,Make,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' NiceName' ModelLinks' Models
Broken Modularization,Model.Edmunds,Make,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' NiceName' ModelLinks' Models
Broken Modularization,Model.Edmunds,Model,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' MakeId' MakeName' MakeNiceName' Name' NiceName' VehicleStyles' VehicleSizes' Categories' Make
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Model.Edmunds,Make,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Model.Edmunds.Make' Model.Edmunds.Model
Broken Hierarchy,Model.Edmunds,Make,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Breeze.Sharp.BaseEntity
Broken Hierarchy,Model.Edmunds,Model,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\breeze_breeze.sharp\Tests\Internal\Model.Edmunds\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Breeze.Sharp.BaseEntity
