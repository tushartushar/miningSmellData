Unutilized Abstraction,Magnum.ForNHibernate.Data,NHibernateRepositoryFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\Data\NHibernateRepositoryFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Magnum.ForNHibernate.Data.Primitives,PrimitiveConvention<PRIM;VALUE>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\Data\Primitives\PrimitiveConvention.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Magnum.ForNHibernate.Data.Primitives,PrimitiveConvention<PRIM;VALUE>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\Data\Primitives\PrimitiveConvention.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Magnum.ForNHibernate.StateMachine,StateMachineUserType,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\StateMachine\StateMachineUserType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StateMachineUserType (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\StateMachine\StateMachineUserType.cs' [73' 103])' UriUserType (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\UriUserType.cs' [63' 93])
Unutilized Abstraction,Magnum.ForNHibernate.StateMachine,StateMachineUserTypeConvention,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\StateMachine\StateMachineUserTypeConvention.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Magnum.ForNHibernate,UriUserTypeConvention,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\UriUserTypeConvention.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Rebellious Hierarchy,Magnum.ForNHibernate.Data,NHibernateRepository<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.ForNHibernate\Data\NHibernateRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose
