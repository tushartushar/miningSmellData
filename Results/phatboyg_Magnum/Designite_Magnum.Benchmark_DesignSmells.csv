Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Magnum.Benchmark,BenchmarkRunner<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.Benchmark\BenchmarkRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Measure which is more interested in members of the type: Benchmark
Unutilized Abstraction,Magnum.Benchmark,BenchmarkRunResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.Benchmark\BenchmarkRunResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Magnum.Benchmark,BenchmarkRunResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Magnum\src\Magnum.Benchmark\BenchmarkRunResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' Iterations' ModelName' SerializerName' SerializedBytesLength' Duration' TimesSlowerThanBest' TimesLargerThanBest
