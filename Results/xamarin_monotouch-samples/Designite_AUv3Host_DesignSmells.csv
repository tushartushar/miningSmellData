Unnecessary Abstraction,AUv3Host,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\AUv3Host\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Window
Unutilized Abstraction,AUv3Host,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\AUv3Host\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AUv3Host,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\AUv3Host\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,AUv3Host,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\AUv3Host\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RowsInSection which is more interested in members of the type: SimplePlayEngine
Feature Envy,AUv3Host,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\AUv3Host\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetCell which is more interested in members of the type: SimplePlayEngine
Feature Envy,AUv3Host,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\AUv3Host\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RowSelected which is more interested in members of the type: SimplePlayEngine
Unutilized Abstraction,FilterDemoFramework,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\FilterDSPKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,FilterDemoFramework,FilterDSPKernel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\FilterDSPKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CutoffRamper' ResonanceRamper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FilterDemoFramework,FilterView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\FilterView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FilterDemoFramework.FilterView' FilterDemoFramework.IFilterViewDelegate
Broken Hierarchy,FilterDemoFramework,BufferedInputBus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\BufferedInputBus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FilterDemoFramework.BufferedAudioBus
