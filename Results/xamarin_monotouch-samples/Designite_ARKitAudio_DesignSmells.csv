Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ARKitAudio,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\ARKitAudio\ARKitAudio\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ARKitAudio,ARSCNViewExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\ARKitAudio\ARKitAudio\Extensions\ARSCNViewExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ARKitAudio,HitTestRay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\ARKitAudio\ARKitAudio\Extensions\ARSCNViewExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Origin' Direction
Unnecessary Abstraction,ARKitAudio,FeatureHitTestResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\ARKitAudio\ARKitAudio\Extensions\ARSCNViewExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Position' DistanceToRayOrigin' FeatureHit' FeatureDistanceToHitResult
Unutilized Abstraction,ARKitAudio,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\ARKitAudio\ARKitAudio\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,ARKitAudio,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\ARKitAudio\ARKitAudio\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
