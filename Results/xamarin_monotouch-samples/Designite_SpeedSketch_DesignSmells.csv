Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SpeedSketch,EstimatedSample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\DrawingEngine\CGDrawingEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Index' Sample
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,CGContextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\DrawingEngine\CGContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SpeedSketch,StrokeIndex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\StrokeModel\StrokeGestureRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Stroke' Index
Feature Envy,SpeedSketch,CanvasMainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\UI\CanvasMainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ZoomingEnded which is more interested in members of the type: StrokeCGView
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,CGMathExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\Helpers\CGMathExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,CGVectorExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\Helpers\CGMathExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,CGPointExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\Helpers\CGMathExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,CGSizeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\Helpers\CGMathExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SpeedSketch,Helpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\Helpers\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SpeedSketch,Stroke,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\StrokeModel\Stroke.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CalligraphyFallbackAzimuthUnitVector
Deficient Encapsulation,SpeedSketch,Stroke,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\SpeedSketch\SpeedSketch\StrokeModel\Stroke.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CalligraphyFallbackAzimuthUnitVector
