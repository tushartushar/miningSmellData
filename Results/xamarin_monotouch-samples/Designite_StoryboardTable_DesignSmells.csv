Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,StoryboardTable,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\StoryboardTable_LocalAuthentication\StoryboardTable\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,StoryboardTable,AuthenticationViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\StoryboardTable_LocalAuthentication\StoryboardTable\AuthenticationViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StoryboardTable,MasterViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\StoryboardTable_LocalAuthentication\StoryboardTable\MasterViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StoryboardTable.MasterViewController' StoryboardTable.TaskDetailViewController
Rebellious Hierarchy,StoryboardTable,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\StoryboardTable_LocalAuthentication\StoryboardTable\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
