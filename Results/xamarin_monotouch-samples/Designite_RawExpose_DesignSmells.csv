Unnecessary Abstraction,RawExpose,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Window
Unutilized Abstraction,RawExpose,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RawExpose,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RawExpose,AlbumCollectionViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\AlbumCollectionViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RawExpose,Keys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\ImageViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CoreImageLibrary' kCIOutputNativeSizeKey' kCIInputNeutralTemperatureKey' kCIInputNeutralTintKey' kCIInputScaleFactorKey
Deficient Encapsulation,RawExpose,Keys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\ImageViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: kCIOutputNativeSizeKey' kCIInputNeutralTemperatureKey' kCIInputNeutralTintKey' kCIInputScaleFactorKey
Deficient Encapsulation,RawExpose,Keys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\ImageViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: kCIOutputNativeSizeKey' kCIInputNeutralTemperatureKey' kCIInputNeutralTintKey' kCIInputScaleFactorKey
Broken Modularization,RawExpose,Keys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\RawExpose\ImageViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CoreImageLibrary' kCIOutputNativeSizeKey' kCIInputNeutralTemperatureKey' kCIInputNeutralTintKey' kCIInputScaleFactorKey
