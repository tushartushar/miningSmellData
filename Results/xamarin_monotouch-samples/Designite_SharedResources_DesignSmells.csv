Duplicate Abstraction,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Photos,ImagePickerScreen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Photos\ImagePickerScreen.xib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ImagePickerScreen (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Photos\ImagePickerScreen.xib.cs' [261' 287])' CustomCameraViewScreen (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Photos\CustomCameraViewScreen.xib.cs' [85' 111])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Photos,FeatureGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Photos\ImagePickerScreen.xib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Features' features
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Photos,Feature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Photos\ImagePickerScreen.xib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' IsAvailable
Unutilized Abstraction,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.AVAssets,PhotoLibraryController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\AVAssets\PhotoLibraryController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Contacts,PhoneNumberTableSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Contacts\AddressBookScreen.xib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: labels' numbers
Deficient Encapsulation,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Contacts,PhoneNumberTableSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Contacts\AddressBookScreen.xib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: labels' numbers
Deficient Encapsulation,Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Contacts,EditablePhoneTableCell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\Screens\iPhone\Contacts\AddressBookScreen.xib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: txtLabel' txtPhoneNumber' dataIndex
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Example_SharedResources,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SharedResources\SharedResources\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Example_SharedResources.AppDelegate' Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Network.ActivityIndicatorScreen' Example_SharedResources.Screens.iPhone.Home.HomeNavController
