Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioTapProcessor,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,AudioTapProcessor,AudioTapProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TapProcess which is more interested in members of the type: AVAudioTapProcessorContext
Feature Envy,AudioTapProcessor,AudioTapProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TapPrepare which is more interested in members of the type: AVAudioTapProcessorContext
Feature Envy,AudioTapProcessor,AudioTapProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateVolumes which is more interested in members of the type: AVAudioTapProcessorContext
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioTapProcessor,GradientView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\Views\GradientView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AudioTapProcessor,AVAudioTapProcessorContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AVAudioTapProcessorContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SupportedTapProcessingFormat' IsNonInterleaved' SampleRate' SampleCount' LeftChannelVolume' RightChannelVolume' AudioUnit
Broken Modularization,AudioTapProcessor,AVAudioTapProcessorContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AVAudioTapProcessorContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SupportedTapProcessingFormat' IsNonInterleaved' SampleRate' SampleCount' LeftChannelVolume' RightChannelVolume' AudioUnit
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AudioTapProcessor,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\MainScreen\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AudioTapProcessor.MainViewController' AudioTapProcessor.AudioTapProcessor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AudioTapProcessor,SettingsViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\SettingsViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AudioTapProcessor.SettingsViewController' AudioTapProcessor.MainViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AudioTapProcessor,AudioTapProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor\AudioTapProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AudioTapProcessor.AudioTapProcessor' AudioTapProcessor.MainViewController' AudioTapProcessor.SettingsViewController
