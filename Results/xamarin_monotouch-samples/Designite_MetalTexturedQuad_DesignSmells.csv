Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MetalTexturedQuad,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalTexturedQuad\MetalTexturedQuad\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MetalTexturedQuad,ImageViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalTexturedQuad\MetalTexturedQuad\ImageViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MetalTexturedQuad,MathUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalTexturedQuad\MetalTexturedQuad\MathUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MetalTexturedQuad,ImageView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalTexturedQuad\MetalTexturedQuad\ImageView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MetalTexturedQuad.ImageView' MetalTexturedQuad.Renderer
Rebellious Hierarchy,MetalTexturedQuad,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalTexturedQuad\MetalTexturedQuad\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
