Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,WatchConnectivity,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\watchOS\WatchConnectivity\WatchConnectivity\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,WatchConnectivity,WCSessionManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\watchOS\WatchConnectivity\WatchConnectivity.OnWatchExtension\SessionManager\WCSessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Device
Deficient Encapsulation,WatchConnectivity,WCSessionManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\watchOS\WatchConnectivity\WatchConnectivity.OnWatchExtension\SessionManager\WCSessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Device
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WatchConnectivity,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\watchOS\WatchConnectivity\WatchConnectivity\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WatchConnectivity.ViewController' WatchConnectivity.TableDelegate
Rebellious Hierarchy,WatchConnectivity,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\watchOS\WatchConnectivity\WatchConnectivity\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' OnActivated' WillTerminate
