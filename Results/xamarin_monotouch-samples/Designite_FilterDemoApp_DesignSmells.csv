Unnecessary Abstraction,FilterDemoApp,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\FilterDemoApp\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Window
Unutilized Abstraction,FilterDemoApp,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\FilterDemoApp\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FilterDemoApp,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\FilterDemoApp\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FilterDemoFramework,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\FilterDSPKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,FilterDemoFramework,FilterDSPKernel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\FilterDSPKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CutoffRamper' ResonanceRamper
Broken Hierarchy,FilterDemoFramework,BufferedInputBus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\FilterDemoApp\Framework\BufferedInputBus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FilterDemoFramework.BufferedAudioBus
