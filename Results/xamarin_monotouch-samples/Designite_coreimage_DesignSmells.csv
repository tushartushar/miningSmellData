Unutilized Abstraction,coreimage,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\CoreImage\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,coreimage,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\CoreImage\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 55 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,coreimage,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\CoreImage\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 123 methods
Insufficient Modularization,coreimage,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\CoreImage\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 130
