Unutilized Abstraction,AVCamBarcode.Extensions,EnumExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\Extensions\EnumExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCamBarcode.Extensions,FontExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\Extensions\FontExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCamBarcode.Extensions,CGRectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\Extensions\CGRectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCamBarcode,SessionSetupResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\Enums\SessionSetupResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCamBarcode,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AVCamBarcode,MetadataObjectLayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\MetadataObjectLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MetadataObject
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCamBarcode,MetadataObjectLayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\MetadataObjectLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,AVCamBarcode,CameraViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\CameraViewController.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AVCamBarcode,IItemSelectionViewControllerDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\ItemSelectionViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AVCamBarcode.IItemSelectionViewControllerDelegate' AVCamBarcode.ItemSelectionViewController<T>
Rebellious Hierarchy,AVCamBarcode,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\AVCamBarcode\AVCamBarcode\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' OnActivated' WillTerminate
