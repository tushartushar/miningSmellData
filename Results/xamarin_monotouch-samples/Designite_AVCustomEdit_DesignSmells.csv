Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCustomEdit,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AVCustomEdit,PlayerView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\PlayerView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,AVCustomEdit,CrossDissolveRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\OpenGL Renderers\CrossDissolveRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RenderPixelBuffer
Imperative Abstraction,AVCustomEdit,DiagonalWipeRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\OpenGL Renderers\DiagonalWipeRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RenderPixelBuffer
Deficient Encapsulation,AVCustomEdit,OpenGLRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\OpenGL Renderers\OpenGLRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OffscreenBufferHandle
Insufficient Modularization,AVCustomEdit,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,AVCustomEdit,CrossDissolveRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\OpenGL Renderers\CrossDissolveRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CrossDissolveRenderer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\OpenGL Renderers\CrossDissolveRenderer.cs' [113' 136])' DiagonalWipeRenderer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\OpenGL Renderers\DiagonalWipeRenderer.cs' [202' 225])
Broken Hierarchy,AVCustomEdit,CrossDissolveCompositor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\Custom Compositors\CustomVideoCompositor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AVCustomEdit.CustomVideoCompositor
Broken Hierarchy,AVCustomEdit,DiagonalWipeCompositor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AVCustomEdit\AVCustomEdit\Custom Compositors\CustomVideoCompositor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AVCustomEdit.CustomVideoCompositor
