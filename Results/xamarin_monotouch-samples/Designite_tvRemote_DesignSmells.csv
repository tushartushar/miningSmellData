Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,tvRemote,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,tvRemote,FirstViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\FirstViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,tvRemote,SecondViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\SecondViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,tvRemote,SiriRemote,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\Graphics\SiriRemote.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DrawSiriRemote
Unutilized Abstraction,tvRemote,SiriRemoteView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\SiriRemoteView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,tvRemote,EventView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\EventView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,UIKit,TVFont,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\UIKit\TVFont.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LabelFontSize
Deficient Encapsulation,UIKit,TVFont,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\UIKit\TVFont.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LabelFontSize
Rebellious Hierarchy,tvRemote,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\tvos\tvRemote\tvRemote\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' OnActivated' WillTerminate
