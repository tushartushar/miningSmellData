Unutilized Abstraction,DisablingPullingDownASheet,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios13\DisablingPullingDownASheet\DisablingPullingDownASheet\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DisablingPullingDownASheet,EditViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios13\DisablingPullingDownASheet\DisablingPullingDownASheet\EditViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DisablingPullingDownASheet.EditViewController' DisablingPullingDownASheet.IEditViewControllerDelegate
Rebellious Hierarchy,DisablingPullingDownASheet,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios13\DisablingPullingDownASheet\DisablingPullingDownASheet\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' OnActivated' WillTerminate
Rebellious Hierarchy,DisablingPullingDownASheet,RootViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios13\DisablingPullingDownASheet\DisablingPullingDownASheet\RootViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
