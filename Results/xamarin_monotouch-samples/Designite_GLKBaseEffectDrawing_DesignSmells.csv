Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,GLKBaseEffectDrawing,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\GLKBaseEffectDrawing\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GLKBaseEffectDrawing,Monkey,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\GLKBaseEffectDrawing\Monkey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MeshVertexData
Deficient Encapsulation,GLKBaseEffectDrawing,Monkey,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\GLKBaseEffectDrawing\Monkey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MeshVertexData
Deficient Encapsulation,GLKBaseEffectDrawing,Monkey,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\GLKBaseEffectDrawing\Monkey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MeshVertexData
