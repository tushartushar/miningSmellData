Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PhotoHandoff,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\PhotoHandoff\PhotoHandoff\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PhotoHandoff,DetailViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\PhotoHandoff\PhotoHandoff\DetailViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateAndPresentFilterVC which is more interested in members of the type: FilterViewController
Unutilized Abstraction,PhotoHandoff,Utils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\PhotoHandoff\PhotoHandoff\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,PhotoHandoff,DetailViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\PhotoHandoff\PhotoHandoff\DetailViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PhotoHandoff,DetailViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\PhotoHandoff\PhotoHandoff\DetailViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PhotoHandoff.DetailViewController' PhotoHandoff.FilterViewController
