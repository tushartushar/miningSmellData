Unnecessary Abstraction,CollectionView,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Window
Unutilized Abstraction,CollectionView,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CollectionView,FirstViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\FirstViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CollectionView,SecondViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\SecondViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CollectionView,ThirdViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\ThirdViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CollectionView,WaterfallCollectionView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\CollectionLayouts\WaterfallCollectionView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionView' CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionSource
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CollectionView,WaterfallCollectionDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\CollectionLayouts\WaterfallCollectionDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionDelegate' CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionView
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CollectionView,WaterfallCollectionSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios9\CollectionView\CollectionView\CollectionLayouts\WaterfallCollectionSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionSource' CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionView' CollectionView.WaterfallCollectionDelegate
