Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MetalBasic3D,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetalBasic3D,Uniforms,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\Uniforms.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' modelviewProjectionMatrix' normalMatrix' ambientColor' diffuseColor
Deficient Encapsulation,MetalBasic3D,Uniforms,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\Uniforms.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: modelviewProjectionMatrix' normalMatrix' ambientColor' diffuseColor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MetalBasic3D,GameViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\GameViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MetalBasic3D.GameViewController' MetalBasic3D.IGameViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MetalBasic3D,GameView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\GameView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MetalBasic3D.GameView' MetalBasic3D.IGameView
Rebellious Hierarchy,MetalBasic3D,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
Rebellious Hierarchy,MetalBasic3D,Renderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios8\MetalBasic3D\MetalBasic3D\Renderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RenderViewController
