Duplicate Abstraction,WorkingWithImages,FirstViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\WorkingWithImages\FirstViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FirstViewController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\WorkingWithImages\FirstViewController.cs' [38' 64])' SecondViewController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\WorkingWithImages\SecondViewController.cs' [36' 62])
Unutilized Abstraction,WorkingWithImages,SecondViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\WorkingWithImages\SecondViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,WorkingWithImages,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\WorkingWithImages\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
