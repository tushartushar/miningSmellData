Unutilized Abstraction,ObjectTracker,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\VisionObjectTracker\ObjectTracker\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ObjectTracker,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\VisionObjectTracker\ObjectTracker\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ObjectTracker,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\VisionObjectTracker\ObjectTracker\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ObjectTracker,RectangleScanner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\VisionObjectTracker\ObjectTracker\RectangleScanner.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RectangleDetected which is more interested in members of the type: Overlay
Feature Envy,ObjectTracker,ObjectTracker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\VisionObjectTracker\ObjectTracker\ObjectTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ObjectTracked which is more interested in members of the type: Overlay
Rebellious Hierarchy,ObjectTracker,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios11\VisionObjectTracker\ObjectTracker\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' OnActivated' WillTerminate
