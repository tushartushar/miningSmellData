Unnecessary Abstraction,MessagesExtension,IQueryItemRepresentable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\Model\IQueryItemRepresentable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: QueryItem' QueryItemKey
Unutilized Abstraction,MessagesExtension,IceCreamView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MessagesExtension,IceCreamView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Parts which is more interested in members of the type: IceCream

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ReuseIdentifier
Deficient Encapsulation,MessagesExtension,IceCreamOutlineCell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamOutlineCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ReuseIdentifier
Deficient Encapsulation,MessagesExtension,IceCreamCell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ReuseIdentifier
Deficient Encapsulation,MessagesExtension,IceCreamCell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ReuseIdentifier
Deficient Encapsulation,MessagesExtension,IceCreamPartCell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamPartCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ReuseIdentifier
Deficient Encapsulation,MessagesExtension,IceCreamPartCell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamPartCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ReuseIdentifier
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MessagesExtension,IceCreamsViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\IceCreamsViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MessagesExtension.IceCreamsViewController' MessagesExtension.IIceCreamsViewControllerDelegate
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MessagesExtension,BuildIceCreamViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\ios10\IceCreamBuilder\MessagesExtension\BuildIceCreamViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MessagesExtension.BuildIceCreamViewController' MessagesExtension.IBuildIceCreamViewControllerDelegate
