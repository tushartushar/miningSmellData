Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Image' Latitute' Longitude' Title' Subtitle' Coordinate
Missing Hierarchy,MapCallouts,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\MapCallouts\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types.
