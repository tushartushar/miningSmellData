Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleTextInput,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SimpleTextInput,EditableCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\EditableCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Tap which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleCoreTextView
Feature Envy,SimpleTextInput,EditableCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\EditableCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ReplaceRange which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleCoreTextView
Feature Envy,SimpleTextInput,EditableCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\EditableCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InsertText which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleCoreTextView
Feature Envy,SimpleTextInput,SimpleCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\SimpleCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SelectionChanged which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleCaretView
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleTextInput,SimpleCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\SimpleCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SelectionColor' CaretColor
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleTextInput,SimpleCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\SimpleCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SelectionColor' CaretColor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleTextInput,SimpleCoreTextView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\SimpleTextInput\SimpleCoreTextView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimpleTextInput.SimpleCoreTextView' SimpleTextInput.SimpleCaretView
