Unutilized Abstraction,StateRestoration,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\StateRestoration\StateRestoration\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,StateRestoration,FilterViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\StateRestoration\StateRestoration\FilterViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Update which is more interested in members of the type: ImageFilter
