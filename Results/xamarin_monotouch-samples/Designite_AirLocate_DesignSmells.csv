Duplicate Abstraction,AirLocate,RangingViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AirLocate\AirLocate\RangingViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RangingViewController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AirLocate\AirLocate\RangingViewController.cs' [119' 149])' CalibrationBeginViewController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AirLocate\AirLocate\CalibrationBeginViewController.cs' [216' 246])
Unnecessary Abstraction,AirLocate,CalibrationCompletedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AirLocate\AirLocate\CalibrationCalculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MeasurePower' Error
Unnecessary Abstraction,AirLocate,CalibrationProgressEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AirLocate\AirLocate\CalibrationCalculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PercentComplete
Rebellious Hierarchy,AirLocate,PeripheralManagerDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\AirLocate\AirLocate\ConfigurationViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StateUpdated
