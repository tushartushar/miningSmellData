Unutilized Abstraction,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLCommon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' red' green' blue' alpha
Unutilized Abstraction,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLCommon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,TextureCoord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLCommon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' S' T
Deficient Encapsulation,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLCommon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: red' green' blue' alpha
Deficient Encapsulation,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,TextureCoord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLCommon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: S' T
Deficient Encapsulation,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,GLView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Controller
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerVertexDirectionalLighting,GLView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_monotouch-samples\OpenGL\PerVertexDirectionalLighting\GLView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerVertexDirectionalLighting.GLView' PerVertexDirectionalLighting.GLViewController
