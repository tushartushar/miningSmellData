Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder,DataExtractor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder\DataExtractor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadMetaZonesFromFile which is more interested in members of the type: TimeZoneData
Feature Envy,TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder,DataExtractor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder\DataExtractor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PatchData which is more interested in members of the type: TimeZoneData
Unutilized Abstraction,TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TimeZoneNames,TimeZoneSelectionData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames\TimeZoneData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' ThresholdUtc
Unnecessary Abstraction,TimeZoneNames,TimeZoneValues,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames\TimeZoneValues.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Generic' Standard' Daylight
Deficient Encapsulation,TimeZoneNames,TimeZoneData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames\TimeZoneData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DisplayNames
Insufficient Modularization,TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder,DataExtractor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames.DataBuilder\DataExtractor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Modularization,TimeZoneNames,CldrLanguageData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mj1856_TimeZoneNames\src\TimeZoneNames\TimeZoneData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Formats' FallbackFormat' ShortNames' LongNames' CountryNames' CityNames
