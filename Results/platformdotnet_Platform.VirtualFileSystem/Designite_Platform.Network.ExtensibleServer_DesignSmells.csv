Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.CommandServer,CommandBuildException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\CommandServer\CommandBuildException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer,ConnectionFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\ConnectionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.ConnectionFactory' Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.NetworkServer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer,Connection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.Connection' Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.ConnectionFactory' Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.NetworkServer
Broken Hierarchy,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer,AnyRunLevel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\AnyRunLevel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.RunLevel
Rebellious Hierarchy,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer,Connection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoRun
Broken Hierarchy,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer,DisconnectedRunLevel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\DisconnectedRunLevel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.RunLevel
Broken Hierarchy,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer,NormalRunLevel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\NormalRunLevel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.RunLevel
Broken Hierarchy,Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.CommandServer,CommandNetworkServer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer\CommandServer\CommandNetworkServer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Platform.Network.ExtensibleServer.NetworkServer
