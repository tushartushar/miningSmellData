Deficient Encapsulation,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,MediaFileFactoryEntry,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\ConfigurationSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type
Insufficient Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,AbstractMediaFile,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\AbstractMediaFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,CompositeMediaFileFactory,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\CompositeMediaFileFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia.CompositeMediaFileFactory' Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia.MediaFileFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,MediaFileFactory,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\MediaFileFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia.MediaFileFactory' Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia.CompositeMediaFileFactory
Rebellious Hierarchy,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,AbstractMediaFile,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\AbstractMediaFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek' Open' Close
Cyclic Hierarchy,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,MediaFileFactory,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\MediaFileFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CompositeMediaFileFactory
Broken Hierarchy,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,VolumeFaderService,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\VolumeFaderService.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Providers.AbstractService
Broken Hierarchy,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia,VolumeFaderServiceType,C:\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Multimedia\VolumeFaderServiceType.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Platform.VirtualFileSystem.ServiceType
