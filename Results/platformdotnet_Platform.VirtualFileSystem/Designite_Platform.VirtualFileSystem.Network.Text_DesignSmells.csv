Unutilized Abstraction,ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.Zip.Compression.Streams.Interactive,InteractiveInflaterInputStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\InteractiveInflaterInputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text.Protocol,TextNetworkProtocolException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\Protocol\TextNetworkProtocolException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text.Protocol,TextNetworkProtocol,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\Protocol\TextNetworkProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text,TextNetworkFileSystemClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\TextRandomAccessNetworkFileSystemStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text,TextNetworkFileSystemClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\TextRandomAccessNetworkFileSystemStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Broken Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text.Protocol,ErrorCodes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\Protocol\ErrorCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CANCELLED' END_OF_FILE' NOT_SUPPORTED' UNAUTHORISED' FILE_ACCESS' IO_ERROR' FILE_NOT_FOUND' DIRECTORY_NOT_FOUND' UNEXPECTED' MISSING_PARAMS' TOO_MANY_PARAMS' INVALID_PARAM' INVALID_VALUE' MALFORMED_URI' INVALID_COMMAND' UNEXPECTED_COMMAND
Broken Modularization,Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text.Protocol,ResponseCodes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\Protocol\ResponseCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RESPONSE_MARKER' ENCODING' OK' READY' CANCEL' ERROR
Rebellious Hierarchy,ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.Zip.Compression.Streams,InteractiveDeflaterOutputStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\platformdotnet_Platform.VirtualFileSystem\src\Platform.VirtualFileSystem.Network.Text\InteractiveDeflatorOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek' SetLength' ReadByte' Read' BeginRead' BeginWrite
