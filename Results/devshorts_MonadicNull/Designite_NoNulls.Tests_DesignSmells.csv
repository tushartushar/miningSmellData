Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NoNulls.Tests.Extensions,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Extensions\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NoNulls.Tests.Tests,TestSplits,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Tests\ExpressionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NoNulls.Tests.Tests,TestSplits,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Tests\ExpressionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TestSplits (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Tests\ExpressionTests.cs' [236' 259])' TestSplits (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Tests\ExpressionTests.cs' [268' 291])
Unutilized Abstraction,NoNulls.Tests.Tests,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Tests\ExpressionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NoNulls.Tests.SampleData,User,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\SampleData\TestDataTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Field
Insufficient Modularization,NoNulls.Tests.Tests,ExpressionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\Tests\ExpressionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NoNulls.Tests.SampleData,User,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devshorts_MonadicNull\NoNulls\NoNulls.Tests\SampleData\TestDataTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NoNulls.Tests.SampleData.User' NoNulls.Tests.SampleData.School
