Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Knoema.Localization,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Extensions\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Knoema.Localization,LocalizedObjectExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Repository\LocalizedObjectExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Knoema.Localization,LocalizedAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\LocalizedAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Knoema.Localization,LocalizedAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\LocalizedAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Knoema.Localization.Web,LocalizationModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Web\LocalizationHttpModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Knoema.Localization.Web,LocalizationHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Web\LocalizationHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Knoema.Localization.Web,LocalizationHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Web\LocalizationHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Api which is more interested in members of the type: LocalizationManager
Insufficient Modularization,Knoema.Localization,LocalizationManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\LocalizationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Modularization,Knoema.Localization,ILocalizedObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Repository\ILocalizedObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' LocaleId' Scope' Text' Hash' Translation
Broken Modularization,Knoema.Localization.Repository,LocalizedObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Repository\LocalizedObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' LocaleId' Hash' Scope' Text' Translation
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Knoema.Localization.Web,ScopeEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Knoema_Localization\Core\Web\ScopeEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Knoema.Localization.Web.ScopeEntry' Knoema.Localization.Web.ScopeEntryCollection
