Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests,SalesforceClientTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\SalesforceClientTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests,TestJson,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\SalesforceClientTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' JsonIgnoreMe' JsonRenameMe
Unnecessary Abstraction,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests,ContactStubWithFields,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\Stubs\ContactStubWithFields.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Name' Email' Description
Unutilized Abstraction,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests.Security,UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFlowTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\Security\UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFlowTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests.Stubs,WrongRecordStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\Stubs\WrongRecordStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Description' IsDeleted
Deficient Encapsulation,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests,ContactStubWithFields,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\Stubs\ContactStubWithFields.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Name' Email' Description
Insufficient Modularization,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests,SalesforceClientTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\SalesforceClientTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests,SalesforceClientTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\SalesforceClientTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Modularization,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests.Stubs,ContactStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\Stubs\ContactStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Email' Description' FirstName' LastName
Broken Modularization,SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests.Stubs,RecordStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.FunctionalTests\Stubs\RecordStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Description' PhoneCustom' FirstName' LastName
