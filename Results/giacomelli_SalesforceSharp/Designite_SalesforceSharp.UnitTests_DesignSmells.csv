Unnecessary Abstraction,SalesforceSharp.UnitTests.Stubs,RecordStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.UnitTests\Stubs\RecordStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Insufficient Modularization,SalesforceSharp.UnitTests,SalesforceClientTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\giacomelli_SalesforceSharp\src\SalesforceSharp.UnitTests\SalesforceClientTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
