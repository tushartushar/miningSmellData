Unstable Dependency,KonfDB.Infrastructure,KonfDB.Infrastructure.Configuration.Interfaces,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): KonfDB.Infrastructure.Configuration.Runtime
Unstable Dependency,KonfDB.Infrastructure,KonfDB.Infrastructure.Common,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): KonfDB.Infrastructure.Shell
Unstable Dependency,KonfDB.Infrastructure,KonfDB.Infrastructure.Database.Providers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself.
