(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vim.EditorHost,EditorLocatorUtil,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_VsVim\Src\VimEditorHost\EditorLocatorUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vim.EditorHost,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_VsVim\Src\VimEditorHost\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vim.EditorHost.Implementation.Misc,BasicLoggingServiceInternal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_VsVim\Src\VimEditorHost\Implementation\Misc\BasicLoggingServiceInternal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,Vim.EditorHost,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_VsVim\Src\VimEditorHost\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 54 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Vim.EditorHost,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_VsVim\Src\VimEditorHost\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Vim.EditorHost.Implementation.BasicUndo,BasicUndoHistory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_VsVim\Src\VimEditorHost\Implementation\BasicUndo\BasicUndoHistory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Vim.EditorHost.Implementation.BasicUndo.BasicUndoHistory' Vim.EditorHost.Implementation.BasicUndo.BasicUndoTransaction
