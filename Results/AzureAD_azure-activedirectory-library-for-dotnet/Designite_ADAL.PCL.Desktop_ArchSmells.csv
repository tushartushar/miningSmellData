Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,ADAL.PCL.Desktop,Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.Internal
Feature Concentration,ADAL.PCL.Desktop,Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AuthenticationContextIntegratedAuthExtensions]' [AdalEventSource' Logger]' [ClientAssertionCertificate' CryptographyHelper]' [AdalOption]' [WebProxyProvider]' [BrokerHelper]' [DeviceAuthHelper' SafeCertContextHandle' X509Native]' [PlatformParameters' PlatformInformation' PromptBehavior' WebUIFactory]' [SecureClientSecret]' [StaTaskScheduler]' [TokenCachePlugin]' [UserPasswordCredential]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.63
