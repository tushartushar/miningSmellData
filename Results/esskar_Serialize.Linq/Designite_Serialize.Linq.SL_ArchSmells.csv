Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Interfaces,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Serialize.Linq.Interfaces' Serialize.Linq.Nodes
Unstable Dependency,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Interfaces,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Serialize.Linq.Nodes' Serialize.Linq.Factories
Unstable Dependency,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Nodes,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Serialize.Linq
God Component,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Nodes,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 32
Feature Concentration,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Interfaces,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IBinarySerializer' ISerializer' ITextSerializer' IXmlSerializer' IJsonSerializer]' [IExpressionContext]' [INodeFactory]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.43
Feature Concentration,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Serializers,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BinarySerializer' DataSerializer' SerializerBase' TextSerializer' XmlSerializer]' [ExpressionConverter' ExpressionSerializer]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29
Scattered Functionality,Serialize.Linq.SL,Serialize.Linq.Serializers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Serialize.Linq.Interfaces' Serialize.Linq.Nodes
