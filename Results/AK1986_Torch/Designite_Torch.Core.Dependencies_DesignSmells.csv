Imperative Abstraction,Torch.Core.Dependencies,DirectoryDependency,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core.Dependencies\DirectoryDependency.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Check
Unnecessary Abstraction,Torch.Core.Dependencies,Framework,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core.Dependencies\NetFrameworkDepedency.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' ServicePack' Version
