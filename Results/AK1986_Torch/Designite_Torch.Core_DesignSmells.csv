Unutilized Abstraction,Torch.Core,FrameworkVersion,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core\Enums\NetFrameworkVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Torch.Core,IDepedenecyCheckResult,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core\IDepedenecyCheckResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Status' Exception' Message' DependencyName
Broken Modularization,Torch.Core,FrameworkVersion,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core\Enums\NetFrameworkVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Net20' Net30' Net35' Net40Client' Net40Full' Net45Client' Net45Full
Rebellious Hierarchy,Torch.Core,ConfigComponentFinder,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core\ConfigComponentFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetList
Wide Hierarchy,Torch.Core,IDependency,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core\IDependency.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: DirectoryDependency' FileDependency' GacDependency' IisDepedency' InternetConnectionDepedency' PingDependency' NetFrameworkDepedency' PortDepedency' PowerShellDependency' SqlServerDependency' WebResourceDependency' WindowsServiceDependency
Rebellious Hierarchy,Torch.Core,XmlFileComponentFinder,C:\repos\AK1986_Torch\Torch.Core\XmlFileComponentFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetList
