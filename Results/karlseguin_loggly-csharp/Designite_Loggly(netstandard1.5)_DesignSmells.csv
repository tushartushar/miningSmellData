This class contains only the following public method: Send
Unnecessary Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,ErrorMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\ErrorMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Message' InnerException
Unnecessary Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,EventBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\EventBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Tags' Id
Unutilized Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,Response,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Response.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,EntryJsonResponseBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\EntryJsonResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TotalEvents' Page' TimeStamp
Unnecessary Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,EntryJsonResponse<TMessage>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\EntryJsonResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Events
Unnecessary Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,EntryJsonResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\EntryJsonResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Events
Unnecessary Abstraction,Loggly.Responses,Field,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\FieldResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Term' Count
Feature Envy,Loggly.Transports.Syslog,SyslogUdpTransport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Transports\SyslogTransports\SyslogUdpTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Close which is more interested in members of the type: UdpClientEx
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Loggly,ISearchTransport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Transports\Interfaces\ISearchTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Loggly.ISearchTransport' Loggly.Responses.SearchResponseBase' Loggly.Responses.SearchResponse
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Loggly.Responses,SearchResponse<TMessage>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\SearchResponseT.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Loggly.Responses.SearchResponse<TMessage>' Loggly.ISearchTransport' Loggly.Responses.SearchResponseBase
Unfactored Hierarchy,Loggly.Responses,SearchResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\SearchResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  SearchResponse (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\SearchResponse.cs' [21' 46])' SearchResponse<TMessage> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\karlseguin_loggly-csharp\source\loggly\Responses\Search\SearchResponseT.cs' [20' 45])
