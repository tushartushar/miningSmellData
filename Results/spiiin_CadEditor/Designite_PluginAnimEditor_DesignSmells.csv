Deficient Encapsulation,CadEnemyEditor,FrameData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\AnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: frameNo' frameAddr' tileCount' coordsIndex' tiles
Deficient Encapsulation,CadEnemyEditor,CoordData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\AnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: addr
Deficient Encapsulation,CadEnemyEditor,TileInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\AnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: index' property
Deficient Encapsulation,PluginAnimEditor,AnimConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\PluginAnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: animCount' animAddrHi' animAddrLo' frameCount' frameAddrHi' frameAddrLo' coordCount' coordAddrHi' coordAddrLo' pal' animBankNo
Deficient Encapsulation,PluginAnimEditor,AnimConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\PluginAnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: animCount' animAddrHi' animAddrLo' frameCount' frameAddrHi' frameAddrLo' coordCount' coordAddrHi' coordAddrLo' pal' animBankNo
Insufficient Modularization,CadEnemyEditor,AnimEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\AnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Broken Modularization,PluginAnimEditor,AnimConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\PluginAnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' animCount' animAddrHi' animAddrLo' frameCount' frameAddrHi' frameAddrLo' coordCount' coordAddrHi' coordAddrLo' pal' animBankNo
Rebellious Hierarchy,PluginAnimEditor,PluginAnimEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\CadEnemyEditor\PluginAnimEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
