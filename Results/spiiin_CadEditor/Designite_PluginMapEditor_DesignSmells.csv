(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PluginMapEditor,MapUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\MapUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PluginMapEditor,MapUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\MapUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MapUtils (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\MapUtils.cs' [26' 52])' MapUtils (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\MapUtils.cs' [69' 95])
Unnecessary Abstraction,PluginMapEditor,MapInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\PluginMapEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dataAddr' palAddr' videoNo' attribsAddr
Deficient Encapsulation,PluginMapEditor,MapData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\MapData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: mapData' attrData' width' height
Deficient Encapsulation,PluginMapEditor,MapInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\PluginMapEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dataAddr' palAddr' videoNo' attribsAddr
Deficient Encapsulation,PluginMapEditor,MapConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\PluginMapEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: mapsInfo' loadMapFunc' saveMapFunc' readOnly' sharedPal
Deficient Encapsulation,PluginMapEditor,MapConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\PluginMapEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: mapsInfo' loadMapFunc' saveMapFunc' readOnly' sharedPal
Rebellious Hierarchy,PluginMapEditor,PluginMapEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spiiin_CadEditor\PluginMapEditor\PluginMapEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: addToolButton
