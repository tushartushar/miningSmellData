Unnecessary Abstraction,SettingsProviderNet.Tests,ComplexType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_SettingsProvider.net\src\SettingsProviderNet.Tests\ComplexType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SomeProp
Unutilized Abstraction,SettingsProviderNet.Tests,SettingsProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_SettingsProvider.net\src\SettingsProviderNet.Tests\SettingsProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SettingsProviderNet.Tests,SettingsProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_SettingsProvider.net\src\SettingsProviderNet.Tests\SettingsProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Broken Modularization,SettingsProviderNet.Tests,TestSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_SettingsProvider.net\src\SettingsProviderNet.Tests\TestSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestProp1' SomeEnum' TestProp2' FirstRun' NoSetter' List' List2' IdList' RenamedProperty' Complex' Boolean' ProtectedString' ProtectedStringWithDefault
