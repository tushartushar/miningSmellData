Unnecessary Abstraction,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,X,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\MasonBuilderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: X1' X2' YList' YArray
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,Y,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\MasonBuilderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MyX' Text

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Title' Description
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,MasonTestConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\MasonTestConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,TestHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\TestHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason.TestHelper' Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.TestHelper
Unutilized Abstraction,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests,SetupFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\SetupFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests,TestHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\TestHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Modularization,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,Rels,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\MasonTestConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RelBase' Contact' Projects' ProjectCreate' ProjectDelete' IssueAdd' IssueQuery
Broken Hierarchy,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,X,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\MasonBuilderTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ramone.Hypermedia.Resource
Broken Hierarchy,Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests.Mason,Y,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JornWildt_Ramone\Ramone.Hypermedia.Tests\Mason\MasonBuilderTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ramone.Hypermedia.Resource
