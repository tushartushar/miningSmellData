Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,AsyncVoid,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\owin_museum-piece-gate\src\Samples\Samples.ViaRouting\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.2\TaskHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,TaskHelpersExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\owin_museum-piece-gate\src\Samples\Samples.ViaRouting\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.2\TaskHelpersExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Broken Modularization,Gate,OwinConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\owin_museum-piece-gate\src\Main\Gate\OwinConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' RequestBody' RequestHeaders' RequestScheme' RequestMethod' RequestPathBase' RequestPath' RequestQueryString' RequestProtocol' CallCancelled' ResponseStatusCode' ResponseReasonPhrase' ResponseHeaders' ResponseBody' TraceOutput' RemoteIpAddress' RemotePort' LocalIpAddress' LocalPort' OnSendingHeaders
Insufficient Modularization,System.Threading.Tasks,TaskHelpersExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\owin_museum-piece-gate\src\Samples\Samples.ViaRouting\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.2\TaskHelpersExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
