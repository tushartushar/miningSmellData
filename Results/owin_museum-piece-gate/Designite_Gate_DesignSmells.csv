Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,AsyncVoid,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\owin_museum-piece-gate\src\Main\Gate\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.2\TaskHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,TaskHelpersExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\owin_museum-piece-gate\src\Main\Gate\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.2\TaskHelpersExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
