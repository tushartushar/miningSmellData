Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImageLoading.Sample,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LoadingPlaceholderPath' ErrorPlaceholderPath' LoadingPlaceholderUrl' ErrorPlaceholderUrl' Images
Duplicate Abstraction,ImageLoading.Sample,MainActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\MainActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainActivity (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\MainActivity.cs' [49' 71])' RecyclerActivity (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\RecyclerActivity.cs' [34' 56])
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageLoading.Sample.Views,BorderedImageView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\Views\BorderedImageView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ImageLoading.Sample,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Images
Deficient Encapsulation,ImageLoading.Sample,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Images
Deficient Encapsulation,ImageLoading.Sample,PictureAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\PictureAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Items
Broken Modularization,ImageLoading.Sample,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LoadingPlaceholderPath' ErrorPlaceholderPath' LoadingPlaceholderUrl' ErrorPlaceholderUrl' Images
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageLoading.Sample,MainActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\samples\ImageLoading.Sample\MainActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageLoading.Sample.MainActivity' ImageLoading.Sample.RecyclerActivity
