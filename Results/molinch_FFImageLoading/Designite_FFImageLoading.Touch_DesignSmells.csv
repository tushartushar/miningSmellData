(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Work,IBitmapExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Shared.IosMac\Work\BitmapHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Work,PlatformImageLoaderTask<TImageView>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Shared.IosMac\Work\PlatformImageLoaderTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Init
Unnecessary Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Decoders,BaseDecoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Shared.IosMac\Decoders\BaseDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Cross,MvxCachedImageView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Cross\MvxCachedImageView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,FFImageLoading,mach_task_basic_info,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Shared.IosMac\Helpers\PlatformPerformance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: virtual_size' resident_size' resident_size_max' user_time' system_time' policy' suspend_count
Broken Modularization,FFImageLoading,mach_task_basic_info,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Shared.IosMac\Helpers\PlatformPerformance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' virtual_size' resident_size' resident_size_max' user_time' system_time' policy' suspend_count
Rebellious Hierarchy,FFImageLoading,ImageService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Touch\ImageService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreatePlatformMD5HelperInstance' CreatePlatformLoggerInstance' CreatePlatformPerformanceInstance' CreateMainThreadDispatcherInstance' CreateDataResolverFactoryInstance
Broken Hierarchy,FFImageLoading.Decoders,BaseDecoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\FFImageLoading.Shared.IosMac\Decoders\BaseDecoder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FFImageLoading.Decoders.GifDecoder
