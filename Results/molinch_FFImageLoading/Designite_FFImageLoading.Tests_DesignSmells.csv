Unnecessary Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Tests,DownloadCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Cache\DownloadCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Tests.Concurrency,GenericPriorityQueue_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\GenericPriorityQueueTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Tests.Concurrency,GenericPriorityQueue_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\GenericPriorityQueueTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GenericPriorityQueue_Test (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\GenericPriorityQueueTests.cs' [108' 129])' SimplePriorityQueue_Test (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\SimplePriorityQueueTests.cs' [85' 106])
Unutilized Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Tests.Concurrency,PendingTasksQueue_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\PendingTasksQueueTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FFImageLoading.Tests.Concurrency,SimplePriorityQueue_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\SimplePriorityQueueTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,FFImageLoading.Tests.Concurrency,GenericPriorityQueue_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\molinch_FFImageLoading\source\Tests\FFImageLoading.Tests\Concurrency\GenericPriorityQueueTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
