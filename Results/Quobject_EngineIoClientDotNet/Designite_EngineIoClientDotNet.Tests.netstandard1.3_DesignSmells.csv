Unnecessary Abstraction,Quobject.EngineIoClientDotNet_Tests.ClientTests,ConnectionConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Quobject_EngineIoClientDotNet\Src\EngineIoClientDotNet.Tests.mono\ClientTests\ConnectionConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PORT' HOSTNAME' SSL_PORT' TIMEOUT
Feature Envy,Quobject.EngineIoClientDotNet_Tests.ClientTests,ConnectionTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Quobject_EngineIoClientDotNet\Src\EngineIoClientDotNet.Tests.mono\ClientTests\ConnectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: NotSendPacketsIfSocketCloses which is more interested in members of the type: Socket
