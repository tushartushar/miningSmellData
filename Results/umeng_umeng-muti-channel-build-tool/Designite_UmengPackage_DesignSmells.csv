Feature Envy,UmengPackage,ConfigTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\umeng_umeng-muti-channel-build-tool\VSProject\UmengPackage\ConfigTemplate.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: save_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ProjectConfigration
Duplicate Abstraction,UmengPackage,EditItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\umeng_umeng-muti-channel-build-tool\VSProject\UmengPackage\ConfigTemplate.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: UmengPackage.EditItem' UmengPackage.Source.Model.EditItem
Unutilized Abstraction,UmengPackage,ChannelTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\umeng_umeng-muti-channel-build-tool\VSProject\UmengPackage\ChannelTool.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: end
Deficient Encapsulation,UmengPackage.Source.Model,ProjectConfigration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\umeng_umeng-muti-channel-build-tool\VSProject\UmengPackage\Source\Model\ProjectConfigration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Candinate' KeystoreFilePath' KeystorePassword' AliasPassword' Alias
Broken Hierarchy,UmengPackage,EditItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\umeng_umeng-muti-channel-build-tool\VSProject\UmengPackage\ConfigTemplate.xaml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UmengPackage.ChannelItem
Broken Hierarchy,UmengPackage,TemplateItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\umeng_umeng-muti-channel-build-tool\VSProject\UmengPackage\ConfigTemplate.xaml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UmengPackage.ChannelItem
