Imperative Abstraction,APIComparer,ApiChanges,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\ApiChanges.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FromDiff
Unutilized Abstraction,APIComparer,CecilExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\CecilExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,APIComparer,ComparerEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\ComparerEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,APIComparer,APIUpgradeToMarkdownFormatter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\APIUpgradeToMarkdownFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,APIComparer,FormattingInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\FormattingInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,APIComparer,MatchingMember<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\MatchingMember.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Right
Unutilized Abstraction,APIComparer.BreakingChanges,BreakingChangeFinder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\BreakingChanges\BreakingChangeFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,APIComparer,Diff,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\Diff.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LeftOrphanTypes' MatchingTypeDiffs' RightOrphanTypes
Deficient Encapsulation,APIComparer,MatchingMember<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\MatchingMember.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Left' Right
Deficient Encapsulation,APIComparer,TypeDiff,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\TypeDiff.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LeftType' RightType' LeftOrphanFields' RightOrphanFields' MatchingFields' LeftOrphanMethods' RightOrphanMethods' MatchingMethods
Broken Hierarchy,APIComparer,EmptyDiff,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_APIComparer\APIComparer.Core\EmptyDiff.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): APIComparer.Diff
