Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NPOI.Tools.POIFSBrowser,AbstractTreeNode,C:\repos\xoposhiy_npoi\trunk\tools\POIFS Browser\AbstractTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AbstractTreeNode' DirectoryTreeNode
Cyclic Hierarchy,NPOI.Tools.POIFSBrowser,AbstractTreeNode,C:\repos\xoposhiy_npoi\trunk\tools\POIFS Browser\AbstractTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DirectoryTreeNode
Rebellious Hierarchy,NPOI.Tools.POIFSBrowser,CellValueRecordTreeNode,C:\repos\xoposhiy_npoi\trunk\tools\POIFS Browser\HSSF\CellValueRecordTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetBytes
Missing Hierarchy,NPOI.Tools.POIFSBrowser,DirectoryTreeNode,C:\repos\xoposhiy_npoi\trunk\tools\POIFS Browser\DirectoryTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Record' RecordBase (in method "HandleWorkbook" of class "DirectoryTreeNode").
Broken Hierarchy,NPOI.Tools.POIFSBrowser,DirectoryTreeNode,C:\repos\xoposhiy_npoi\trunk\tools\POIFS Browser\DirectoryTreeNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractTreeNode
