Unnecessary Abstraction,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email,Conventions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\Conventions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HtmlSectionName' TextSectionName
Unutilized Abstraction,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email,TemplateEngineExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\TemplateEngineExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email.Helpers,ResourceTemplateHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\Helpers\ResourceTemplateHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Get which is more interested in members of the type: TemplateContext
Unutilized Abstraction,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email.Helpers,ResourceTemplateHelperExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\Helpers\ResourceTemplateHelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email.Rendering,RenderingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\Rendering\RenderingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email,EmailTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\EmailTemplate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Essential.Templating.Razor.Email.EmailTemplate' Essential.Templating.Razor.Email.Helpers.ResourceTemplateHelper
Rebellious Hierarchy,Essential.Templating.Razor.Email.Rendering,EmailTemplateVisitor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smolyakoff_essential-templating\src\Essential.Templating.Razor.Email\Rendering\EmailTemplateVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start' End
