Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Excavator,ConnectPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Views\ConnectPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Excavator,SelectedId,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Controls\DataNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id
Unutilized Abstraction,Excavator,MainWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Views\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Excavator.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Excavator,SelectedId,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Controls\DataNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id
Deficient Encapsulation,Excavator,SelectedId,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Controls\DataNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Id
Deficient Encapsulation,Excavator,ExcavatorComponent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Controls\ExcavatorComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ReportingNumber' requireAnonymousGiver' refreshIndividualListEachCycle' DataNodes' DisableAuditing' ImportDateTime
Deficient Encapsulation,Excavator,ExcavatorComponent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Controls\ExcavatorComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DisableAuditing' ImportDateTime
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Excavator,ProgressPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NewSpring_Excavator\Excavator\Views\ProgressPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Excavator.ProgressPage' Excavator.ConfigurationPage
