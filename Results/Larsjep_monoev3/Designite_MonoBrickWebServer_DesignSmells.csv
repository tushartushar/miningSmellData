Feature Envy,MonoBrickWebServer.Modules,EV3Module,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Larsjep_monoev3\MonoBrickWebServer\Modules\EV3Module.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetAllMotorInfo which is more interested in members of the type: EV3Model
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoBrickWebServer,Webserver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Larsjep_monoev3\MonoBrickWebServer\MonoBrickWebserver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MonoBrickWebServer.Modules,EV3Module,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Larsjep_monoev3\MonoBrickWebServer\Modules\EV3Module.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MonoBrickWebServer.Models,DummyMotorModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Larsjep_monoev3\MonoBrickWebServer\Models\DummyMotorModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Update
