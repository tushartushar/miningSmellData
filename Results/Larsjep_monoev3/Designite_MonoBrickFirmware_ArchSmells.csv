Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,MonoBrickFirmware,MonoBrickFirmware.Tools,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MonoBrickFirmware.Movement' MonoBrickFirmware.Sound
Unstable Dependency,MonoBrickFirmware,MonoBrickFirmware.Display,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MonoBrickFirmware.Tools' MonoBrickFirmware.Native
Unstable Dependency,MonoBrickFirmware,MonoBrickFirmware.UserInput,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MonoBrickFirmware.Tools
Unstable Dependency,MonoBrickFirmware,MonoBrickFirmware.Display.Dialogs,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MonoBrickFirmware.Display.Dialogs.UserInput' MonoBrickFirmware.Display.Animation
