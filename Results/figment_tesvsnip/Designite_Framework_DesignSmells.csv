Unnecessary Abstraction,TESVSnip.Framework.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' UseUTF8' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,TESVSnip.Framework,Pair,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Pair.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: a' b
Deficient Encapsulation,TESVSnip.Framework.Persistence,SerializationInfoCache,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Persistence\SerializationInfoCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' ObjectType' Value
Insufficient Modularization,TESVSnip.Framework.Collections,OrderedDictionary,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Collections\ordereddictionary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TESVSnip.Framework,TypeConverter,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\TypeConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 41 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TESVSnip.Framework,TypeConverter,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\TypeConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TESVSnip.Framework,TypeConverter,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\TypeConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 117
Insufficient Modularization,TESVSnip.Framework.Persistence,PersistAssist,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Persistence\PersistAssist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 135
Broken Modularization,TESVSnip.Framework.Persistence,PersistableAttribute,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Persistence\PersistableAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Context' Default' Flags' Version' _context' _type
Rebellious Hierarchy,TESVSnip.Framework.Collections,AdvancedList,F:\newReposMay17\figment_tesvsnip\Framework\Collections\AdvancedList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnPostSerialization
