Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ALE.Http,IContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\IContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ContextBag' Response' Request' User
Unnecessary Abstraction,ALE.Http,IController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\IController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Request' Response' Context
Unutilized Abstraction,ALE.Http,Routing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\Routing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ALE.Http,Static,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\Static.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ALE.Http,Route,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\Route.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HandlerInfo
Deficient Encapsulation,ALE.Http,Static,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\Static.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MimeTypes
Deficient Encapsulation,ALE.Http,Static,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\Static.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MimeTypes
Broken Modularization,ALE.Http,IRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\IRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Context' AcceptTypes' ContentEncoding' ContentLength' ContentType' Cookies' InputStream' Method' Headers' IsAuthenticated' IsLocal' Url' UrlReferer' UserAgent' UserLanguages
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ALE.Http,IContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\IContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ALE.Http.IContext' ALE.Http.IRequest
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ALE.Http,IResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\IResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ALE.Http.IResponse' ALE.Http.IContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ALE.Http,IRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\IRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ALE.Http.IRequest' ALE.Http.IContext' ALE.Http.IResponse
Broken Hierarchy,ALE.Http,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\blesh_ALE\ALE.Http\Server.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ALE.Http.ServerBase
