Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,Shovel.Tests,ShovelPack.Tests,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ArgumentsTests]' [ArgumentsTestExtensions]' [FluentTaskBuildingTests' ShovelAcceptanceTestsBase' ShovelTestException' ShovelRunnerUndefinedTaskExceptionHandlingTests' AcceptanceTests' ShovelRunnerErrorTests' ShovelRunnerTests]' [MsBuildRunnerTests]' [TaskTests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.45,ShovelPack.Tests.ArgumentsTests' ShovelPack.Tests.ArgumentsTestExtensions' ShovelPack.Tests.MsBuildRunnerTests' ShovelPack.Tests.TaskTests,ShovelPack.Tests.ArgumentsTests' ShovelPack.Tests.ArgumentsTestExtensions' ShovelPack.Tests.FluentTaskBuildingTests' ShovelPack.Tests.AcceptanceTests' ShovelPack.Tests.MsBuildRunnerTests' ShovelPack.Tests.ShovelRunnerErrorTests' ShovelPack.Tests.ShovelRunnerTests' ShovelPack.Tests.ShovelAcceptanceTestsBase' ShovelPack.Tests.ShovelTestException' ShovelPack.Tests.ShovelRunnerUndefinedTaskExceptionHandlingTests' ShovelPack.Tests.TaskTests
Scattered Functionality,Shovel.Tests,ShovelPack.Tests,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: ShovelPack.Tasks' ShovelPack,ShovelPack.Tasks.ITask' ShovelPack.FluentTaskInterface,ShovelPack.Tasks.ITask' ShovelPack.FluentTaskInterface
