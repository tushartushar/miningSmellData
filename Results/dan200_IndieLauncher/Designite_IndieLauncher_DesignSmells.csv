Deficient Encapsulation,Dan200.Launcher.Main,Logger,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Main\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DebugBuild
Deficient Encapsulation,Dan200.Launcher.Main,Logger,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Main\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DebugBuild
Deficient Encapsulation,Dan200.Launcher.RSS,RSSEntry,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\RSS\RSSEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Title' Description' Link
Deficient Encapsulation,Dan200.Launcher.RSS,RSSChannel,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\RSS\RSSChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Title' Description' Link
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dan200.Launcher.Main,Program,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Main\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Program' Installer' Logger
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dan200.Launcher.Main,Program,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Main\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Program' Installer' Logger' Installer' Logger
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dan200.Launcher.Main,Installer,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Main\Installer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Installer' Logger
Insufficient Modularization,Dan200.Launcher.Util,KeyValuePairs,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Util\KeyValuePairs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Dan200.Launcher.Util,ProgramArguments,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Util\ProgramArguments.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KeyValuePairs
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dan200.Launcher.Util,ProgressStream,D:\newReposJune17\dan200_IndieLauncher\IndieLauncher\Launcher\Util\ProgressStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetLength' Write
