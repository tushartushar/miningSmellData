Unutilized Abstraction,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingBindingElementImporter,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\InterceptingBindingElementImporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingElement,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingelement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingChannelFactory,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingChannelFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetProperty
Duplicate Abstraction,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingChannelFactory,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingChannelFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: InterceptingChannelFactory[113' 133]' InterceptingChannelFactory[228' 248]
Duplicate Abstraction,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingInputChannel,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingDuplexChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: InterceptingInputChannel[159' 191]' InterceptingChannelListener[320' 352]
Imperative Abstraction,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingChannelListener,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingChannelListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetProperty
Broken Hierarchy,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingInputChannel,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingDuplexChannel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): InterceptingChannelBase
Broken Hierarchy,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingDuplexChannel,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingDuplexChannel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): InterceptingInputChannel
Broken Hierarchy,WSO2.WCF.MessageInterceptor,InterceptingDuplexSessionChannel,C:\repos\wso2_bam-data-publishers\WCF\WCFMessageInterceptor\interceptingDuplexChannel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): InterceptingDuplexChannel
