Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev.Data.Infras.Extensions,ExpressionExtension,C:\repos\zbw911_DevLib.Mvc\Framework2\Dev.Data.Infras\Extensions\ExpressionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Dev.Data.Infras.Extensions,ExpressionVisitor,C:\repos\zbw911_DevLib.Mvc\Framework2\Dev.Data.Infras\Extensions\ExpressionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Visit
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev.Data.Infras.Extensions,ss,C:\repos\zbw911_DevLib.Mvc\Framework2\Dev.Data.Infras\Extensions\ExpressionBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Str' Id
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev.Data.Infras.Extensions,test,C:\repos\zbw911_DevLib.Mvc\Framework2\Dev.Data.Infras\Extensions\ExpressionBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Dev.Data.Infras.Specification,Specification,C:\repos\zbw911_DevLib.Mvc\Framework2\Dev.Data.Infras\Specification\Specification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Predicate
Insufficient Modularization,Dev.Data.Infras.Extensions,ExpressionVisitor,C:\repos\zbw911_DevLib.Mvc\Framework2\Dev.Data.Infras\Extensions\ExpressionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 107
