Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NetSerializer,Helpers,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NetSerializer.Helpers' NetSerializer.Serializer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NetSerializer,Helpers,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NetSerializer.Helpers' NetSerializer.Serializer' NetSerializer.IDynamicTypeSerializer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NetSerializer,IDynamicTypeSerializer,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\ITypeSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NetSerializer.IDynamicTypeSerializer' NetSerializer.Serializer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NetSerializer,IDynamicTypeSerializer,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\ITypeSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NetSerializer.IDynamicTypeSerializer' NetSerializer.Serializer' NetSerializer.ObjectSerializer
Insufficient Modularization,NetSerializer,Serializer,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NetSerializer,Serializer,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NetSerializer.Serializer' NetSerializer.IDynamicTypeSerializer
Insufficient Modularization,NetSerializer,Primitives,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NetSerializer,Primitives,C:\repos\tomba_netserializer\NetSerializer\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
