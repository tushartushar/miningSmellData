Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ArduinoControl,ControlSet,C:\repos\emackey_arduino-control\VisualStudio\ArduinoControl\ControlSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ArduinoControl,ControlSet,C:\repos\emackey_arduino-control\VisualStudio\ArduinoControl\ControlSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ArduinoControl,ArduinoPin,C:\repos\emackey_arduino-control\VisualStudio\ArduinoControl\ArduinoPin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ArduinoPin' ArduinoPort
