Unnecessary Abstraction,PSL,Info,C:\repos\pleonex_tinke\Plugins\PSL\PSL\GBCS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' offset' size' offset' size
Duplicate Abstraction,PSL,LINK,C:\repos\pleonex_tinke\Plugins\PSL\PSL\LINK.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
