Unutilized Abstraction,ChocolateyGui.Subprocess,ChocolateyExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\chocolatey_ChocolateyGUI\Source\ChocolateyGui.Subprocess\ChocolateyExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ChocolateyGui.Subprocess,ChocolateyService,F:\newReposMay17\chocolatey_ChocolateyGUI\Source\ChocolateyGui.Subprocess\ChocolateyService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectedClients
Deficient Encapsulation,ChocolateyGui.Subprocess,ChocolateyService,F:\newReposMay17\chocolatey_ChocolateyGUI\Source\ChocolateyGui.Subprocess\ChocolateyService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConnectedClients
Insufficient Modularization,ChocolateyGui.Subprocess,ChocolateyService,F:\newReposMay17\chocolatey_ChocolateyGUI\Source\ChocolateyGui.Subprocess\ChocolateyService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ChocolateyGui.Subprocess,ChocolateyService,F:\newReposMay17\chocolatey_ChocolateyGUI\Source\ChocolateyGui.Subprocess\ChocolateyService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ChocolateyService' Program
