Deficient Encapsulation,CloudInit,CIEngine,D:\newReposJune17\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CIEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Headers
Deficient Encapsulation,CloudInit,CIEngine,D:\newReposJune17\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CIEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Headers
Missing Hierarchy,CloudInit,CIService,D:\newReposJune17\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CIService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IInputModule' INotificationProvider (in method "Main" of class "CIService").
Rebellious Hierarchy,CloudInit,CloudInitService,D:\newReposJune17\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CloudInitService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStop
