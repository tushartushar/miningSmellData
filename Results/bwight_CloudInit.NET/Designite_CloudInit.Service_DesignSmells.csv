Imperative Abstraction,CloudInit,CIService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CIService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unutilized Abstraction,CloudInit,CloudInitService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CloudInitService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CloudInit,LSAHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\LSAHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CloudInit,LSA_UNICODE_STRING,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\LSAHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Length' MaximumLength' Buffer
Deficient Encapsulation,CloudInit,CIEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CIEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Headers
Deficient Encapsulation,CloudInit,CIEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CIEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Headers
Deficient Encapsulation,CloudInit,LSA_UNICODE_STRING,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\LSAHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Length' MaximumLength' Buffer
Deficient Encapsulation,CloudInit,LSA_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\LSAHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Length' RootDirectory' ObjectName' Attributes' SecurityDescriptor' SecurityQualityOfService
Broken Modularization,CloudInit,LSA_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\LSAHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Length' RootDirectory' ObjectName' Attributes' SecurityDescriptor' SecurityQualityOfService
Rebellious Hierarchy,CloudInit,CloudInitService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwight_CloudInit.NET\Source\CloudInit.Service\CloudInitService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStop
