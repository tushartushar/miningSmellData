Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,ResponseRetriever,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ResponseRetriever.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SubmitRequest
Unnecessary Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,RequestContents,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\RequestContents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequestId' ResponseQueueName' Request
Unnecessary Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,ResponseContents,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ResponseContents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequestId' Response
Unutilized Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,ServiceClient,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,ServiceClientQueueNames,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ServiceClientQueueNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RequestQueueName' ResponseQueueName
Imperative Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,ServiceWorker,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ServiceWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessRequestsAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,AzureDistributedService,ServiceWorker,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ServiceWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AzureDistributedService,ServiceClientQueueNames,C:\repos\brentrossen_AzureDistributedService\AzureDistributedService\ServiceClientQueueNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RequestQueueName' ResponseQueueName
