Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Questor,frmMain,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: frmMain' Questor
Insufficient Modularization,Questor,Questor,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Questor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 574
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionSet' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext' Option' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionSet' OptionContext' Option' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionContext,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionContext' Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionContext,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionContext' Option' OptionSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,Option,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Option' OptionContext' OptionSet' OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 125
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionSet' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Questor.Storylines,IStoryline,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Storylines\IStoryline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IStoryline' Storyline
Unfactored Hierarchy,Questor.Storylines,MaterialsForWarPreparation,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\Questor\Storylines\MaterialsForWarPreparation.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: MaterialsForWarPreparation[11' 31]' TransactionDataDelivery[18' 38]
