Imperative Abstraction,ValueDump,frmMain,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Log
Unutilized Abstraction,ValueDump,frmMain,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Questor,InvType,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\InvType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Save
Unnecessary Abstraction,ValueDump.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Questor,InvType,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\InvType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Minerals
Deficient Encapsulation,Questor,InvType,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\InvType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Minerals
Insufficient Modularization,ValueDump,frmMain,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 183
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Questor,InvType,F:\newReposMay17\Da-Teach_Questor\ValueDump\InvType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: InvType' ItemCache
