Imperative Abstraction,LibtermkeyTest,MainClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\etc\LibtermkeyTest\LibtermkeyTest\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,Linux.Native,pollfd,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\etc\LibtermkeyTest\LibtermkeyTest\LibTermKey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' fd' events' revents
Deficient Encapsulation,Linux.Native,pollfd,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\etc\LibtermkeyTest\LibtermkeyTest\LibTermKey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fd' events' revents
