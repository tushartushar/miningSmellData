Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xaml,CtorArg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\Factories.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' index' obj
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xaml,IFixupToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\MarkupExtensionsParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,Xaml,MarkupExtensionsParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\MarkupExtensionsParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessMarkupExtension
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xaml,FixupToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\XamlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Expression' PropertyName' Object' DataContext' Ids
Deficient Encapsulation,Xaml,CtorArg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\Factories.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: index' obj
Deficient Encapsulation,Xaml,ObjectInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\XamlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: type' obj' currentProperty' currentPropertyText' key' id
Deficient Encapsulation,Xaml,FixupToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\XamlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Expression' PropertyName' Object' DataContext' Ids
Broken Modularization,Xaml,ObjectInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\XamlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' type' obj' currentProperty' currentPropertyText' key' id
Broken Modularization,Xaml,FixupToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\XamlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Expression' PropertyName' Object' DataContext' Ids
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xaml,ObjectFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\Factories.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xaml.ObjectFactory' Xaml.XamlParser
Missing Hierarchy,Xaml,MarkupExtensionsParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elw00d_consoleframework\Xaml\MarkupExtensionsParser.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IFixupToken' IFixupToken (in method "processMarkupExtensionCore" of class "MarkupExtensionsParser").
