Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.23  All the dependencies among components: from: Binding' to: Binding.Adapters' from: Binding' to: Binding.Converters' from: Binding' to: Binding.Validators' from: Binding' to: Binding.Observables' from: ConsoleFramework.Controls' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: ConsoleFramework.Controls' to: ConsoleFramework.Native' from: ConsoleFramework.Controls' to: ConsoleFramework' from: ConsoleFramework.Controls' to: ConsoleFramework.Core' from: ConsoleFramework.Controls' to: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' from: ConsoleFramework.Controls' to: Binding.Observables' from: ConsoleFramework.Core' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: ConsoleFramework.Core' to: ConsoleFramework' from: ConsoleFramework.Core' to: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' from: ConsoleFramework.Core' to: ConsoleFramework.Native' from: ConsoleFramework.Events' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: ConsoleFramework.Events' to: ConsoleFramework.Native' from: ConsoleFramework.Events' to: Xaml' from: ConsoleFramework.Events' to: ConsoleFramework.Core' from: ConsoleFramework.Events' to: ConsoleFramework' from: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' to: ConsoleFramework.Native' from: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' to: ConsoleFramework.Core' from: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' to: ConsoleFramework' from: ConsoleFramework' to: ConsoleFramework.Core' from: ConsoleFramework' to: ConsoleFramework.Rendering' from: ConsoleFramework' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: ConsoleFramework' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: ConsoleFramework' to: ConsoleFramework.Native' from: ConsoleFramework' to: Xaml' from: ConsoleFramework.Xaml' to: Binding' from: ConsoleFramework.Xaml' to: Xaml' from: ConsoleFramework.Xaml' to: Binding.Converters' from: Examples.AsyncUiUpdate' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.AsyncUiUpdate' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.CheckBoxes' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.CheckBoxes' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.CheckBoxes' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: Examples.Commands' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.Commands' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.Commands' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: Examples.MainMenu' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.MainMenu' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.MainMenu' to: ConsoleFramework.Core' from: Examples.MainMenu' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: Examples' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples' to: Xaml' from: Examples' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples' to: Binding.Observables' from: Examples.RadioButtons' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.RadioButtons' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.TabControl' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.TabControl' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.TreeView' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: Examples.TreeView' to: ConsoleFramework' from: Examples.TreeView' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: TestProject1.Binding' to: Binding' from: TestProject1.Binding' to: Binding.Observables' from: TestProject1.Binding' to: Binding.Converters' from: TestProject1' to: ConsoleFramework.Events' from: TestProject1' to: ConsoleFramework.Native' from: TestProject1' to: ConsoleFramework.Controls' from: TestProject1' to: ConsoleFramework.Core' from: TestProject1' to: Xaml' from: TestProject1.Xaml.EnumsTest' to: Xaml' from: TestProject1.Xaml.TypeExtensionTest' to: Xaml' from: TestProject1.Xaml' to: Xaml' from: TestProject1.Xaml' to: Binding.Observables.,ConsoleFramework.ConsoleApplication' ConsoleFramework.ConsoleApplication' ConsoleFramework.ConsoleApplication' ConsoleFramework.ConsoleApplication' ConsoleFramework.ConsoleApplication' ConsoleFramework.ConsoleApplication
