Unutilized Abstraction,NMoneys.Serialization.Mongo_DB.Tests,CustomConventionsTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dgg_nmoneys\src\NMoneys.Serialization.Mongo_DB.Tests\CustomConventionsTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,NMoneys.Serialization.Mongo_DB.Tests.Support,MoneyContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dgg_nmoneys\src\NMoneys.Serialization.Mongo_DB.Tests\Support\Containers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' PropName

Insufficient Modularization,NMoneys.Serialization.Mongo_DB.Tests,CustomConventionsTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dgg_nmoneys\src\NMoneys.Serialization.Mongo_DB.Tests\CustomConventionsTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
