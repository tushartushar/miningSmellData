Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,sones.Library.BinaryStreamStructure,StreamProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\BinaryStreamStructure\StreamProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,sones.Library.BinaryStreamStructure,StreamProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\BinaryStreamStructure\StreamProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,sones.Library.BinaryStreamStructure,StreamProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\BinaryStreamStructure\StreamProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Close' EndWrite' Flush' SetLength' Write' WriteByte
