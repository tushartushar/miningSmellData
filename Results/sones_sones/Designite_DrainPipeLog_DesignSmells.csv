Duplicate Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.DrainPipeLog.Storage,AppendLog,C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\AppendLog\AppendLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AppendLog (C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\AppendLog\AppendLog.cs' [1' 24])' OnDiscAdress (C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\AppendLog\OnDiscAdress.cs' [1' 24])' WriteThread (C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\AsynchronousThread.cs' [1' 24])' DrainPipeLog (C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\DrainPipeLog.cs' [1' 24])
Deficient Encapsulation,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.DrainPipeLog.Storage,OnDiscAdress,C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\AppendLog\OnDiscAdress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CreationTime' Start' End
Deficient Encapsulation,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.DrainPipeLog,WriteThread,C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\AsynchronousThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BytesInAsyncBuffer' ShutdownComplete
Insufficient Modularization,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.DrainPipeLog,DrainPipeLog,C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\DrainPipeLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.DrainPipeLog,DrainPipeLog,C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\DrainPipeLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.DrainPipeLog,DrainPipeLog,C:\repos\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\DrainPipeLog\Implementations\AppendLog\DrainPipeLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DrainQueryResult
