Unutilized Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,GRAPHVIS_IO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\GRAPHVIS_IO\GRAPHVIS_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,_OptionStrings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\GRAPHVIS_IO\GRAPHVIS_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,ShowEdgeNames,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\GRAPHVIS_IO\GRAPHVIS_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name' description' show' hide
Unnecessary Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,NodeLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\GRAPHVIS_IO\GRAPHVIS_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' source' target' name
Deficient Encapsulation,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,ShowEdgeNames,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\GRAPHVIS_IO\GRAPHVIS_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name' description' show' hide
Deficient Encapsulation,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,ShowEdgeNames,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\GRAPHVIS_IO\GRAPHVIS_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: name' description' show' hide
