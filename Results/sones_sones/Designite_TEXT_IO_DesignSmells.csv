Unutilized Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,TEXT_IO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\TEXT_IO\TEXT_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,TEXT_IO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\TEXT_IO\TEXT_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ICollectionWrapper' ICollectionWrapper (in method "GenerateEdgeViewText" of class "TEXT_IO").
Missing Hierarchy,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.IO,TEXT_IO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\IO\Implementations\TEXT_IO\TEXT_IO.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IHyperEdgeView' ICollectionWrapper (in method "GenerateEdgeViewText" of class "TEXT_IO").
