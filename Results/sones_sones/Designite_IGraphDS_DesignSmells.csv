Duplicate Abstraction,sones.GraphDB.ErrorHandling,AGraphDSException,C:\repos\sones_sones\GraphDS\IGraphDS\ErrorHandling\AGraphDSException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AGraphDSException (C:\repos\sones_sones\GraphDS\IGraphDS\ErrorHandling\AGraphDSException.cs' [1' 20])' IGraphDSVersionCompatibility (C:\repos\sones_sones\GraphDS\IGraphDS\IGraphDS.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,sones.GraphDS,IGraphDSVersionCompatibility,C:\repos\sones_sones\GraphDS\IGraphDS\IGraphDS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MinVersion' MaxVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,sones.GraphDS,IGraphDSVersionCompatibility,C:\repos\sones_sones\GraphDS\IGraphDS\IGraphDS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,sones.GraphDB.ErrorHandling,AGraphDSException,C:\repos\sones_sones\GraphDS\IGraphDS\ErrorHandling\AGraphDSException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): sones.Library.ErrorHandling.ASonesException
