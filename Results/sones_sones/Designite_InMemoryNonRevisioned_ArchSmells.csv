Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,InMemoryNonRevisioned,sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge' sones.GraphFS.Element.Vertex,sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge.IncomingEdgeCollection' sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge.SingleEdge' sones.GraphFS.Element.Vertex.InMemoryVertex
Unstable Dependency,InMemoryNonRevisioned,sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): sones.GraphFS.Element.Vertex,sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge.InMemoryVertex
Scattered Functionality,InMemoryNonRevisioned,sones.GraphFS,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: sones.GraphFS.Element.Vertex' sones.Library.PropertyHyperGraph' sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge,sones.GraphFS.Element.Vertex.InMemoryVertex' sones.Library.PropertyHyperGraph.IEdge' sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge.IncomingEdgeCollection' sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge.SingleEdge' sones.GraphFS.Element.Edge.HyperEdge
