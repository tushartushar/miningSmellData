Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,sones.GraphDS.PluginManager,GraphDSPlugins,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPlugins.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,sones.GraphDS.PluginManager,GraphDSPlugins,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPlugins.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GraphDSPlugins (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPlugins.cs' [1' 20])' GraphDSPluginManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,sones.GraphDS.PluginManager.GraphDSPluginManager,GraphDSPluginManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,sones.GraphDS.PluginManager.GraphDSPluginManager,GraphDSPluginManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GraphDSPluginManager which is more interested in members of the type: PluginManager
Broken Hierarchy,sones.GraphDS.PluginManager.GraphDSPluginManager,GraphDSPluginManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\GraphDS\PluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager\GraphDSPluginManager.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): sones.Library.VersionedPluginManager.AComponentPluginManager
