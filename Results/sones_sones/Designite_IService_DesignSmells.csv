Unnecessary Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.Services,IServiceCompatibility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\Services\IService\IService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MinVersion' MaxVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.Services,IServiceCompatibility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\Services\IService\IService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,sones.Plugins.GraphDS.Services,IServiceCompatibility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\Services\IService\IService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IServiceCompatibility (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\Services\IService\IService.cs' [1' 25])' ServiceStatus (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Plugins\GraphDS\Services\IService\ServiceStatus\ServiceStatus.cs' [1' 25])
