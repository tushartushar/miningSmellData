Unutilized Abstraction,sones.GraphDB.Extensions,IAttributeDefinitionExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\Extensions\IGraphDBExtensions\IAttributeDefinitionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,sones.GraphDB.Extensions,IIncomingEdgeDefinitionExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\Extensions\IGraphDBExtensions\IIncomingEdgeDefinitionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IIncomingEdgeDefinitionExtension (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\Extensions\IGraphDBExtensions\IIncomingEdgeDefinitionExtension.cs' [15' 43])' IOutgoingEdgeDefinitionExtension (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\Extensions\IGraphDBExtensions\IOutgoingEdgeDefinitionExtension.cs' [15' 43])
Unexploited Encapsulation,sones.GraphDB.Extensions,IPropertyDefintionExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\Extensions\IGraphDBExtensions\IPropertyDefintionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IVertex' IEdge (in method "HasValue" of class "IPropertyDefintionExtension").
Unexploited Encapsulation,sones.GraphDB.Extensions,IPropertyDefintionExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sones_sones\Library\Internal\Extensions\IGraphDBExtensions\IPropertyDefintionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IVertex' IEdge (in method "GetValue" of class "IPropertyDefintionExtension").
