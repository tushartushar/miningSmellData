Imperative Abstraction,Http2.TestClient,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,Http2.TestClient.Commands,IUriCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\IUriCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Uri' Method' Path
Unnecessary Abstraction,Http2.TestClient.Handshake,HandshakeResponse,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Handshake\HandshakeResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ResponseBytes' ExtraData' Result
Deficient Encapsulation,Http2.TestClient.Handshake,HandshakeResponse,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Handshake\HandshakeResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ResponseBytes' ExtraData' Result
Broken Modularization,Http2.TestClient.Handshake,HandshakeKeys,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Handshake\HandshakeKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Stream' Options' ConnectionEnd' Successful' Result' True' False
Wide Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,Command,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Http2.TestClient.Commands.DeleteCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.DirCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.EmptyCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.ExitCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.GetCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.HelpCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.PingCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.PostCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.PutCommand' Http2.TestClient.Commands.UnknownCommand
Unfactored Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,DeleteCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\DeleteCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DeleteCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\DeleteCommand.cs' [37' 62])' DirCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\DirCommand.cs' [39' 64])' GetCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\GetCommand.cs' [38' 63])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,DeleteCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\DeleteCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DeleteCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\DeleteCommand.cs' [37' 58])' PutCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\PutCommand.cs' [41' 62])' DirCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\DirCommand.cs' [39' 60])' GetCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\GetCommand.cs' [38' 59])
Rebellious Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,EmptyCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\EmptyCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Parse
Rebellious Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,ExitCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\ExitCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Parse
Unfactored Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,PostCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\PostCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  PostCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\PostCommand.cs' [45' 64])' PutCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\PutCommand.cs' [44' 63])
Rebellious Hierarchy,Http2.TestClient.Commands,UnknownCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_http2-katana\tests\Http2.TestClient\Commands\UnknownCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
