Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Ambiguous Interface,04. Generic Constraints,GenericConstraints,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: GenericConstraintClass<T>,GenericConstraints.GenericConstraintClass<T>
Feature Concentration,04. Generic Constraints,GenericConstraints,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [TestClass1' BaseClass' IInterface' TestClass2' TestClass3]' [GenericConstraintClass<T>]' [GenericConstraints]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.43,GenericConstraints.GenericConstraintClass<T>' GenericConstraints.GenericConstraints
