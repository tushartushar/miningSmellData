Unnecessary Abstraction,Floe.Audio,WaveLevelEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\WaveInMeter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Level
Unutilized Abstraction,Floe.Audio,WaveInMeter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\WaveInMeter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Floe.Audio,VoiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Voice\VoiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Floe.Audio,FilePlayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\FilePlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Floe.Audio,VoicePacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Voice\VoicePacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Floe.Audio.VoicePacket' Floe.Audio.VoicePacketPool
Rebellious Hierarchy,Floe.Audio,FifoStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\FifoStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength
Rebellious Hierarchy,Floe.Audio,Mp3FileStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Mp3FileStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,Floe.Audio,MeterStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\WaveInMeter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Read
Rebellious Hierarchy,Floe.Audio,JitterBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Voice\JitterBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,Floe.Audio,VoiceIn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Voice\VoiceIn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Read
Rebellious Hierarchy,Floe.Audio,WavFileStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\WavFileStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
