Unutilized Abstraction,Floe.Audio,FileFormatException,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Exceptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Floe.Audio,WaveLevelEventArgs,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\WaveInMeter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Level
Unutilized Abstraction,Floe.Audio,MeterStream,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\WaveInMeter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Floe.Audio,FilePlayer,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\FilePlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Floe.Audio,VoicePacket,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Audio\Voice\VoicePacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
