Deficient Encapsulation,Floe.Net,DccChat,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccChat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MessageReceived
Deficient Encapsulation,Floe.Net,DccOperation,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Connected' Disconnected' Error
Insufficient Modularization,Floe.Net,IrcSession,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 41 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Floe.Net,IrcSession,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 65 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Floe.Net,IrcSession,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Unfactored Hierarchy,Floe.Net,DccSendReceiver,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccSendReceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DccSendReceiver (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccSendReceiver.cs' [61' 81])' DccSendSender (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccSendSender.cs' [42' 62])' DccXmitSender (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccXmitSender.cs' [69' 89])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Floe.Net,DccSendSender,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccSendSender.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DccSendSender (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccSendSender.cs' [42' 78])' DccXmitSender (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccXmitSender.cs' [69' 105])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Floe.Net,DccXmitReceiver,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccXmitReceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DccXmitReceiver (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccXmitReceiver.cs' [87' 106])' DccXmitSender (C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Dcc\DccXmitSender.cs' [68' 87])
Wide Hierarchy,Floe.Net,IrcEventArgs,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Floe.Net.IrcNickEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcMessageEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcQuitEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcJoinEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcPartEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcTopicEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcInviteEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcKickEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcChannelModeEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcUserModeEventArgs' Floe.Net.IrcInfoEventArgs' Floe.Net.CtcpEventArgs
Cyclic Hierarchy,Floe.Net,IrcPrefix,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcPrefix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IrcPeer
Cyclic Hierarchy,Floe.Net,IrcPrefix,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcPrefix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IrcServer
Broken Hierarchy,Floe.Net,IrcPeer,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcPrefix.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Floe.Net.IrcPrefix
Broken Hierarchy,Floe.Net,IrcServer,C:\repos\bretternst_Floe\Floe.Net\Irc\IrcPrefix.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Floe.Net.IrcPrefix
