Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RedisWebServices.Tests,AdhocTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\AdhocTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,RedisWebServices.Tests,TestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\TestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestHost' TestConfig
Deficient Encapsulation,RedisWebServices.Tests,TestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\TestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TestHost' TestConfig
Insufficient Modularization,RedisWebServices.Tests,ListOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\ListOperationsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisWebServices.Tests,CommonOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\CommonOperationsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisAdminUI.Tests,SortedSetOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\SortedSetOperationsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisAdminUI.Tests,TestServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\TestServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 93 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisAdminUI.Tests,TestServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\TestServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 104 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisAdminUI.Tests,TestServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\TestServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Broken Hierarchy,RedisWebServices.Tests,CommonOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.RedisWebServices\tests\RedisAdminUI.Tests\CommonOperationsTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RedisWebServices.Tests.TestBase
