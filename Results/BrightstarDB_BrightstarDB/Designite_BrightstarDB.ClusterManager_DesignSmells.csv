Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ClusterManager,ClusterConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterManager\ClusterConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ClusterNodes' MasterConfiguration
Unutilized Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ClusterManager,ClusterConfigurationSectionHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterManager\ClusterConfigurationSectionHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ClusterManager,IClusterManagerRequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterManager\IClusterManagerRequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ClusterManager,ClusterManagerServiceHostFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterManager\ClusterManagerServiceHostFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ClusterManager,ClusterDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterManager\ClusterDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LastUpdated' Status' MasterTcpAddress' SlaveTcpAddresses' MasterHttpAddress' SlaveHttpAddresses
Broken Modularization,BrightstarDB.ClusterManager,ClusterDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterManager\ClusterDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LastUpdated' Status' MasterTcpAddress' SlaveTcpAddresses' MasterHttpAddress' SlaveHttpAddresses
