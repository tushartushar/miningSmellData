Unutilized Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ClusterNode,NodeClient,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterNode\NodeClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ClusterNode,NotMasterException,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterNode\NotMasterException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Unexploited Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ClusterNode,NodeCore,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\cluster\BrightstarDB.ClusterNode\NodeCore.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ClusterUpdateTransaction' ClusterSparqlTransaction (in method "QueueTransaction" of class "NodeCore").
