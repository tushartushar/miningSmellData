Imperative Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,BenchmarkRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\BenchmarkRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,CommandLine,HelpArgument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' help
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,BenchmarkArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\BenchmarkArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectionString' TestDataDirectory' LogFilePath' MaxNumberFiles
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,BenchmarkRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\BenchmarkRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SourceFiles
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BrightstarListener
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: BrightstarListener
Deficient Encapsulation,CommandLine,HelpArgument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: help
Deficient Encapsulation,CommandLine,ArgumentHelpStrings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: syntax' help
Insufficient Modularization,CommandLine,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
