Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,BenchmarkRunner,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\BenchmarkRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unutilized Abstraction,CommandLine,Parser,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,BenchmarkArgs,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\BenchmarkArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectionString' TestDataDirectory' LogFilePath' MaxNumberFiles
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,BenchmarkRunner,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\BenchmarkRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SourceFiles
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,Program,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BrightstarListener
Deficient Encapsulation,BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark,Program,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: BrightstarListener
Insufficient Modularization,CommandLine,Parser,F:\newReposMay17\BrightstarDB_BrightstarDB\src\core\BrightstarDB.ReadWriteBenchmark\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
