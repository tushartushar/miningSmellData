Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PeterO.DocGen,DocGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PeterO.DocGen,TestGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\TestGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,DocVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,DocVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,DocVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 192
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,DocVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PeterO.DocGen.DocVisitor' PeterO.DocGen.MemberSummaryVisitor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,SummaryVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\SummaryVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PeterO.DocGen.SummaryVisitor' PeterO.DocGen.XmlDoc
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,DocVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PeterO.DocGen.DocVisitor' PeterO.DocGen.SummaryVisitor' PeterO.DocGen.MemberSummaryVisitor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,XmlDoc,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\XmlDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PeterO.DocGen.XmlDoc' PeterO.DocGen.DocVisitor' PeterO.DocGen.SummaryVisitor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeterO.DocGen,DocVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteroupc_CBOR\CBORDocs\DocVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
