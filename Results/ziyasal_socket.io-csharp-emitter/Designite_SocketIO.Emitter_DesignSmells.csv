Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SocketIO.Emitter,Emitter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Emitter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Emitter.cs' [98' 122])' Emitter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Emitter.cs' [150' 174])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SocketIO.Emitter,EmitterOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\EmitterOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Port' Host' Key' Version
Unnecessary Abstraction,SocketIO.Emitter,Flags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Flag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' JSON' Volatile' Broadcast' Binary
Unutilized Abstraction,SocketIO.Emitter,Flags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Flag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SocketIO.Emitter,EmitterOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\EmitterOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Version
Deficient Encapsulation,SocketIO.Emitter,Flags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Flag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: JSON' Volatile' Broadcast' Binary
Deficient Encapsulation,SocketIO.Emitter,Flags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ziyasal_socket.io-csharp-emitter\src\SocketIO.Emitter\Flag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: JSON' Volatile' Broadcast' Binary
