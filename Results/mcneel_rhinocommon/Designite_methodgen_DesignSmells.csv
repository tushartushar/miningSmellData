Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,MethodGen,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_namespace' m_includeRhinoDeclarations' m_extra_usings
Deficient Encapsulation,MethodGen,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: m_namespace' m_includeRhinoDeclarations' m_extra_usings
Insufficient Modularization,MethodGen,Declaration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\NativeMethodDeclares.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 124
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MethodGen,NativeMethodDeclares,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\NativeMethodDeclares.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MethodGen.NativeMethodDeclares' MethodGen.Program
