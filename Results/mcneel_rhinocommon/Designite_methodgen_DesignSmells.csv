Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MethodGen,CommandlineParserException,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\CommandlineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MethodGen,Declaration,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\NativeMethodDeclares.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Write
Deficient Encapsulation,MethodGen,Program,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_namespace' m_includeRhinoDeclarations' m_extra_usings
Deficient Encapsulation,MethodGen,Program,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: m_namespace' m_includeRhinoDeclarations' m_extra_usings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MethodGen,NativeMethodDeclares,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\NativeMethodDeclares.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MethodGen.NativeMethodDeclares' MethodGen.Program
Insufficient Modularization,MethodGen,Declaration,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\NativeMethodDeclares.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 118
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MethodGen,Program,C:\repos\mcneel_rhinocommon\methodgen\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MethodGen.Program' MethodGen.NativeMethodDeclares
