Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MvcCodeRouting,CodeRoutingHttpExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_MvcCodeRouting\src\MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http\CodeRoutingHttpExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http,HttpExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_MvcCodeRouting\src\MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http\HttpExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MvcCodeRouting.Controllers,DescribedHttpControllerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_MvcCodeRouting\src\MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http\Controllers\DescribedHttpControllerInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MvcCodeRouting.Controllers.DescribedHttpControllerInfo' MvcCodeRouting.Controllers.HttpControllerInfo
Missing Hierarchy,MvcCodeRouting,CodeRoutingHttpExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_MvcCodeRouting\src\MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http\CodeRoutingHttpExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CustomHttpControllerSelector' CustomApiControllerActionSelector (in method "EnableCodeRouting" of class "CodeRoutingHttpExtensions").
Cyclic Hierarchy,MvcCodeRouting.Controllers,HttpControllerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_MvcCodeRouting\src\MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http\Controllers\HttpControllerInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DescribedHttpControllerInfo
