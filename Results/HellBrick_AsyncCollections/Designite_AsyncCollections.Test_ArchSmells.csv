Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,AsyncCollections.Test,HellBrick.Collections.Test,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Assertions]' [AsyncBatchQueueTest]' [AsyncBoundedPriorityQueueTest' AsyncCollectionTest<TAsyncCollection>' AsyncStackTest' AsyncQueueTest' Order]' [AsyncCollectionTakeFromAnyTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,HellBrick.Collections.Test.Assertions' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncBatchQueueTest' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncCollectionTakeFromAnyTest,HellBrick.Collections.Test.Assertions' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncBatchQueueTest' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncBoundedPriorityQueueTest' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncCollectionTakeFromAnyTest' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncCollectionTest<TAsyncCollection>' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncStackTest' HellBrick.Collections.Test.AsyncQueueTest' HellBrick.Collections.Test.Order
Scattered Functionality,AsyncCollections.Test,HellBrick.Collections.Test,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: HellBrick.Collections' System.Threading.Tasks,HellBrick.Collections.AsyncBatchCollectionExtensions' System.Threading.Tasks.ValueTask' HellBrick.Collections.IAsyncCollection' HellBrick.Collections.AsyncCollectionExtensions,HellBrick.Collections.AsyncBatchCollectionExtensions' System.Threading.Tasks.ValueTask' HellBrick.Collections.IAsyncCollection' HellBrick.Collections.AsyncCollectionExtensions
