Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,ModuleFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\ModuleFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,ModuleFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\ModuleFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ModuleFacts (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\ModuleFacts.cs' [114' 137])' SqlServerStoreFacts (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\SqlServerStoreFacts.cs' [58' 81])
Unutilized Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,PngOptimizerFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\PngOptimizerFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,ReducerFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\ReducerFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,ReducerFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\ReducerFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WillSpriteWithForeignContentHost which is more interested in members of the type: IRRConfiguration
Unutilized Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,SassLessCoffeeFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\SassLessCoffeeFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,SqlServerStoreFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\SqlServerStoreFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,SqlServerStoreFacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\SqlServerStoreFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WillUseSameReductionFromStoreIfAvailable which is more interested in members of the type: FileRepository
Unutilized Abstraction,RequestReduce.Facts.Integration,SqlServerStoreFacts35,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.Facts.Integration\SqlServerStoreFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
