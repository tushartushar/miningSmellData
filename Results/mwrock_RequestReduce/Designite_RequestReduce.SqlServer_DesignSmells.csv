Deficient Encapsulation,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,RequestReduceDB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\RequestReduceDB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultProviderName
Deficient Encapsulation,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,RequestReduceDB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\RequestReduceDB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultProviderName
Broken Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer,RequestReduceFile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\RequestReduceFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequestReduceFileId' Key' FileName' Content' OriginalName' IsExpired' LastUpdated
Broken Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Page<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CurrentPage' TotalPages' TotalItems' ItemsPerPage' Items' Context
Insufficient Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Database,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 99 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Database,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 108 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Database,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 225
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Database,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Database' RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Transaction
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Sql,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Sql' RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Database
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM,Transaction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\ORM\PetaPoco.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Transaction' RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Database' RequestReduce.SqlServer.ORM.Sql
Rebellious Hierarchy,RequestReduce.SqlServer,DbDiskCache,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mwrock_RequestReduce\RequestReduce.SqlServer\DbDiskCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
