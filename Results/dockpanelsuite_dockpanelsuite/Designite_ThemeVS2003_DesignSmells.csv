Duplicate Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2003,Resources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2003.Resources' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005.Resources
Duplicate Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2003,Resources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Resources (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\Resources.Designer.cs' [1' 24])' Strings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\Strings.Designer.cs' [1' 24])

Imperative Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2003DockPaneStrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\VS2003DockPaneStrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetOutline
Unutilized Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,DocumentButton,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\VS2003DockPaneStrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005,VS2005DockOutlineFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockOutlineFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateDockOutline
Insufficient Modularization,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2003DockPaneStrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\VS2003DockPaneStrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Broken Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,TabVS2003,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\VS2003AutoHideStrip.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.Tab
Broken Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2003Theme,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2003\VS2003Theme.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.ThemeBase
Missing Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005,VS2005DockOutline,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockOutlineFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DockPanel' DockPane (in method "CalculateRegion" of class "VS2005DockOutline").
