List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Resources (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\Resources.Designer.cs' [43' 63])' Strings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\Strings.Designer.cs' [43' 63])
Imperative Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005,VS2005DockOutlineFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockOutlineFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateDockOutline
Imperative Abstraction,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2005DockPaneStrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockPaneStrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetOutline
Insufficient Modularization,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2005DockPaneStrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockPaneStrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2005DockPaneStrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockPaneStrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 140
Missing Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005,VS2005DockOutline,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005DockOutlineFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DockPanel' DockPane (in method "CalculateRegion" of class "VS2005DockOutline").
Broken Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,TabVS2005,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005AutoHideStrip.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.Tab
Broken Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,VS2005Theme,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\ThemeVS2005\VS2005Theme.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.ThemeBase
