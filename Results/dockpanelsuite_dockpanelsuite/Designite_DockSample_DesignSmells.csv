The method causing this smell is: ResizeSplash which is more interested in members of the type: SplashScreen
Feature Envy,DockSample,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\DockSample\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: menuItemCloseAllButThisOne_Click which is more interested in members of the type: DockPanel
Unutilized Abstraction,DockSample.Customization,DockHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\DockSample\Customization\DockHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DockSample.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\DockSample\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,DockSample,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\DockSample\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DockSample,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\DockSample\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DockSample,AboutDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\DockSample\AboutDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DockSample.AboutDialog' DockSample.MainForm
