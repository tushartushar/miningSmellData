Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,DockPaneStripBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\DockPaneStripBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.DockPaneStripBase' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.DockContentHandler' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.IDockContent' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.DockContentCollection' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.DockPane
Rebellious Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,DockContentHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\DockContentHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: EndDrag
Missing Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,DockDragHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\DockPanel.DockDragHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DockPane' DockPanel (in method "EndDrag" of class "DockDragHandler").
Rebellious Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,DockPane,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\DockPane.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: EndDrag
Broken Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,DummyContent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\DockPanel.Persistor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.DockContent
Rebellious Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,SplitterControlBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\DockPane.SplitterControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BeginDrag' EndDrag
Cyclic Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,IDockDragSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DockPane
Wide Hierarchy,WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking,SplitterBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dockpanelsuite_dockpanelsuite\WinFormsUI\Docking\SplitterBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005.VS2005WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005.VS2005WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2005.VS2005WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2012.VS2012WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2013.VS2013WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2012.VS2012WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2013.VS2013WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2012.VS2012WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.ThemeVS2013.VS2013WindowSplitterControl' WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.SplitterControl
