Unnecessary Abstraction,NPlant.UI,FileView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nplant_nplant\Src\NPlant.UI\Screens\FileViews\FileView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,NPlant.UI,MainScreenController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nplant_nplant\Src\NPlant.UI\Screens\MainScreenController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.
