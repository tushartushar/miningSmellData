(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test.Utility,TestPackageSourceSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\SourceRepository\TestSourceRepositoryUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test.Utility,TestPackages,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\TestPackages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.Test,ExceptionAssert,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\ExceptionAssert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test.Utility.ProjectManagement,NuGetPackageMoniker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\ProjectManagement\TestProjectKProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Version
Unutilized Abstraction,Test.Utility.ProjectManagement,TestProjectKProject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\ProjectManagement\TestProjectKProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Test.Utility,TestSourceRepositoryUtility,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\SourceRepository\TestSourceRepositoryUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: V2PackageSource' V3PackageSource
Deficient Encapsulation,Test.Utility,TestSourceRepositoryUtility,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\SourceRepository\TestSourceRepositoryUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: V2PackageSource' V3PackageSource
Deficient Encapsulation,Test.Utility,TestPackageSourceSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\SourceRepository\TestSourceRepositoryUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TempPackageSourceContents
Deficient Encapsulation,Test.Utility,TestPackageSourceSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\SourceRepository\TestSourceRepositoryUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TempPackageSourceContents
Insufficient Modularization,Test.Utility,TestMSBuildNuGetProjectSystem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\ProjectManagement.Test\ProjectManagement\TestMSBuildNuGetProjectSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Test.Utility,TestMSBuildNuGetProjectSystem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\ProjectManagement.Test\ProjectManagement\TestMSBuildNuGetProjectSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetPropertyValue' DeleteDirectory
Rebellious Hierarchy,Test.Utility,TestDeleteOnRestartManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\test\Test.Utility\TestDeleteOnRestartManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: MarkPackageDirectoryForDeletion' DeleteMarkedPackageDirectories
