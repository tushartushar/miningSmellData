Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,NuGetProjectEventArgs,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\IDE\ISolutionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,PackageManagementContext,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\Context\PackageManagementContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,PackageManagementConstants,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\PackageManagementConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DefaultMaxDegreeOfParallelism' DefaultRequestTimeout
Imperative Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,ResolverGather,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\Resolution\ResolverGather.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GatherAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,CollectionExtensions,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\Utility\CollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,SourceRepositoryComparer,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\Utility\SourceRepositoryComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.PackageManagement,UriHelper,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\Utility\UriHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

The participating classes in the cycle are: NuGet.PackageManagement.EventTriggerBeginEnd' NuGet.PackageManagement.NuGetEventTrigger
Insufficient Modularization,NuGet.PackageManagement,NuGetPackageManager,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\NuGetPackageManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NuGet.PackageManagement,NuGetPackageManager,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\NuGetPackageManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NuGet.PackageManagement,NuGetPackageManager,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\NuGetPackageManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 177
Rebellious Hierarchy,NuGet.PackageManagement,PackageRestoreManager,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\PackageManagement\IDE\PackageRestoreManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: EnableCurrentSolutionForRestore
