Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGet.ProjectManagement.Projects,ProjectKNuGetProjectBase,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\Projects\ProjectKNuGetProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Modularization,NuGet.ProjectManagement,NuGetProjectMetadataKeys,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\NuGetProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' UniqueName' TargetFramework' FullPath' SupportedFrameworks
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NuGet.ProjectManagement,SourceControlManager,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\SourceControl\SourceControlManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NuGet.ProjectManagement.SourceControlManager' NuGet.ProjectManagement.SourceControlUtility
Broken Modularization,NuGet.ProjectManagement,Constants,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\Utility\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.

Insufficient Modularization,NuGet.ProjectManagement,FileSystemUtility,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\Utility\FileSystemUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NuGet.ProjectManagement,SourceControlUtility,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\SourceControl\SourceControlUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NuGet.ProjectManagement.SourceControlUtility' NuGet.ProjectManagement.SourceControlManager
Rebellious Hierarchy,NuGet.ProjectManagement,EmptyNuGetProjectContext,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\EmptyNuGetProjectContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Log' ReportError
Broken Hierarchy,NuGet.ProjectManagement.Projects,ProjectKNuGetProjectBase,C:\repos\NuGet_NuGet.PackageManagement\src\ProjectManagement\Projects\ProjectKNuGetProject.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NuGet.ProjectManagement.NuGetProject' NuGet.ProjectManagement.Projects.INuGetIntegratedProject
