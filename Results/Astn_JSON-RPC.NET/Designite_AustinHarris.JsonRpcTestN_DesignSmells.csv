Unutilized Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,TreeNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NodeId' Leafs
Unnecessary Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,CustomString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' str
Unnecessary Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,recursiveClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Nested1' Value1
Deficient Encapsulation,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,PreProcessHandlerLocal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rpc' context' run
Deficient Encapsulation,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,PostProcessHandlerLocal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rpc' response' context' run
Deficient Encapsulation,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,CustomString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: str
Insufficient Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 155 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 161 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 172
Insufficient Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,CalculatorService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN,CalculatorService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\AustinHarris.JsonRpcTestN\service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
