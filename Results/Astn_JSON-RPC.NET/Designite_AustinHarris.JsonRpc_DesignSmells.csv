Unutilized Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,JsonRpcService,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\JsonRpcService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,JsonResponse,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\JsonResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: JsonRpc' Result' Error' Id
Unnecessary Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,JsonResponse<T>,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\JsonResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: JsonRpc' Result' Error' Id
Unutilized Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,JsonResponse<T>,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\JsonResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,SMDResult,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\SMDService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AustinHarris.JsonRpc.Client,InProcessClient,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\Client\InProcessJsonRpcClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,SMDService,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\SMDService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dele
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,Handler,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\Handler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AustinHarris.JsonRpc.Handler' AustinHarris.JsonRpc.ServiceBinder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,ServiceBinder,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\ServiceBinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AustinHarris.JsonRpc.ServiceBinder' AustinHarris.JsonRpc.Handler
Missing Hierarchy,AustinHarris.JsonRpc,Handler,C:\repos\Astn_JSON-RPC.NET\Json-Rpc\Handler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: JsonRpcException' JsonRpcException (in method "Handle" of class "Handler").
