Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MediaServices.Client,EnvelopeEncryption,F:\newReposMay17\Azure_azure-sdk-for-media-services\src\net\Client\Common\Common.FileEncryption\EnvelopeEncryption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SchemeVersion' SchemeName
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MediaServices.Client.TransientFaultHandling,ExceptionExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\Azure_azure-sdk-for-media-services\src\net\Client\Common\Common.FileEncryption\ExceptionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
