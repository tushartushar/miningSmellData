Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LanguageGender
Imperative Abstraction,Vernacular,MoCatalog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\MoCatalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetAllResourceStrings
Imperative Abstraction,Vernacular,PluralRules,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\PluralRules.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetOrder
Deficient Encapsulation,Vernacular,Catalog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\Catalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ErrorHandler
Deficient Encapsulation,Vernacular,Catalog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\Catalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ErrorHandler
Deficient Encapsulation,Vernacular,CachedString,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\FieldReflectionResourceCatalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Message' Gender' PluralOrder
Insufficient Modularization,Vernacular,Catalog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\Catalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclic Hierarchy,Vernacular,Catalog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\Catalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DefaultCatalog
Broken Hierarchy,Vernacular,FieldReflectionResourceCatalog<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdio_vernacular\Vernacular.Catalog\Vernacular\FieldReflectionResourceCatalog.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Vernacular.Catalog
