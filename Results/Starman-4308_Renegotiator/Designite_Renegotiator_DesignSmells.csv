Multifaceted Abstraction,Renegotiator,Renegotiator,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Duplicate Abstraction,Renegotiator,Renegotiator,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Renegotiator[389' 426]' Renegotiator[463' 500]
Unutilized Abstraction,KSPPluginFramework,ConfigNodeStorage,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\ConfigNodeStorage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,KSPPluginFramework,ConfigNodeStorage,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\ConfigNodeStorage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ConfigNodeStorage[222' 250]' MonoBehaviourExtended[389' 417]
Unutilized Abstraction,KSPPluginFramework,UnityExtensions,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\ExtensionsUnity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KSPPluginFramework,WindowInitialsAttribute,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\MonoBehaviourWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Visible' DragEnabled' ClampToScreen' TooltipsEnabled' Caption
Multifaceted Abstraction,KSPPluginFramework,MonoBehaviourWindow,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\MonoBehaviourWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Deficient Encapsulation,Renegotiator,Renegotiator,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rnInst' globalMult
Deficient Encapsulation,Renegotiator,Renegotiator,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: rnInst
Deficient Encapsulation,Renegotiator,RNWindow,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rnWindowInst
Deficient Encapsulation,Renegotiator,RNWindow,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: rnWindowInst
Insufficient Modularization,Renegotiator,Renegotiator,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\Renegotiator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 212
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,KSPPluginFramework,MonoBehaviourExtended,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\MonoBehaviourExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MonoBehaviourExtended' SkinsLibrary
Broken Modularization,KSPPluginFramework,WindowInitialsAttribute,C:\repos\Starman-4308_Renegotiator\Source\MonoBehaviourWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Visible' DragEnabled' ClampToScreen' TooltipsEnabled' Caption
