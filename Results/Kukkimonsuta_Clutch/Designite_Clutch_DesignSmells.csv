(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Runtime.Caching,MemoryCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Runtime\Caching\MemoryCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Security,IPrincipalExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Security\IPrincipalExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Security,Principal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Security\Principal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Clutch.Infrastructure,IApplicationConfigurator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Infrastructure\IApplicationConfigurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Assembly' IsDebug' IsTest
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Infrastructure,IApplicationConfigurator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Infrastructure\IApplicationConfigurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Clutch.Data,CollectionPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Data\CollectionPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Clutch.Data.CollectionPage' Clutch.Data.CollectionPage<T>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Clutch.Data,SortOptions<TEntity>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Data\SortOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Clutch.Data.SortOptions<TEntity>' Clutch.Data.SortOptions<TEntity'TKey>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Clutch.Data,CollectionPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch\Data\CollectionPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CollectionPage<T>
