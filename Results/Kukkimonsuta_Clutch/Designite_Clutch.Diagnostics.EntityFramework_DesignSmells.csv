Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,DbTracingExtensions,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\DbTracingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,DbTracingProviderFactory,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\DbTracingProviderFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,DbTracingProviderServices,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\DbTracingProviderServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,Ref,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\Ref.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,Ref,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\Ref.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,DbTracingDataReader,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\DbTracingDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,DbTracingListener,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\IDbTracingListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CommandExecuting' CommandFinished' ReaderFinished' CommandFailed' CommandExecuted
Rebellious Hierarchy,Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework,EntityFrameworkBootstrap,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics.EntityFramework\EntityFrameworkBootstrap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Startup
