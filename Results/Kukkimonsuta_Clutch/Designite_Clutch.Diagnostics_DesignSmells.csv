Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics,Ref,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\Ref.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics,Ref,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\Ref.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Clutch.Diagnostics,DiagnosticsContext,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\DiagnosticsContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Clutch.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsContext' Clutch.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsFragment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Clutch.Diagnostics,DiagnosticsFragment,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\DiagnosticsFragment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Clutch.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsFragment' Clutch.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsContext
Broken Hierarchy,Clutch.Diagnostics,AverageAggregator,C:\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\Aggregators\AverageAggregator.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Clutch.Diagnostics.AggregatorBase
