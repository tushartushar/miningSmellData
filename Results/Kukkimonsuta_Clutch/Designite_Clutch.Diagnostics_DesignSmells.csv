Unnecessary Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics,Ref,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\Ref.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Clutch.Diagnostics,Ref,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\Ref.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Clutch.Diagnostics,DiagnosticsContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kukkimonsuta_Clutch\src\Clutch.Diagnostics\DiagnosticsContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Clutch.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsContext' Clutch.Diagnostics.DiagnosticsFragment
