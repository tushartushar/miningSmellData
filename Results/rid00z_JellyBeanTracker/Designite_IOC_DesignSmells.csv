Broken Modularization,TinyIoC,ResolveOptions,C:\repos\rid00z_JellyBeanTracker\JellyBeanTracker.Mobile\IOC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UnregisteredResolutionAction' NamedResolutionFailureAction' Default' FailNameNotFoundOnly' FailUnregisteredAndNameNotFound' FailUnregisteredOnly' _Default' _FailUnregisteredAndNameNotFound' _FailUnregisteredOnly' _FailNameNotFoundOnly' _UnregisteredResolutionAction' _NamedResolutionFailureAction
Insufficient Modularization,TinyIoC,TinyIoCContainer,C:\repos\rid00z_JellyBeanTracker\JellyBeanTracker.Mobile\IOC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 86 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TinyIoC,TinyIoCContainer,C:\repos\rid00z_JellyBeanTracker\JellyBeanTracker.Mobile\IOC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 115 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TinyIoC,TinyIoCContainer,C:\repos\rid00z_JellyBeanTracker\JellyBeanTracker.Mobile\IOC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 182
