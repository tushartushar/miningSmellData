Unnecessary Abstraction,AdventureWorks.Dal.Adapter.DatabaseSpecific,ActionProcedures,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_RawDataAccessBencher\LLBLGenPro\DatabaseSpecific\ActionProcedures.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AdventureWorks.Dal.Adapter.DatabaseSpecific,ActionProcedures,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_RawDataAccessBencher\LLBLGenPro\DatabaseSpecific\ActionProcedures.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AdventureWorks.Dal.Adapter.DatabaseSpecific,DataAccessAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_RawDataAccessBencher\LLBLGenPro\DatabaseSpecific\DataAccessAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Deficient Encapsulation,AdventureWorks.Dal.Adapter.DatabaseSpecific,DataAccessAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_RawDataAccessBencher\LLBLGenPro\DatabaseSpecific\DataAccessAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectionStringKeyName
Deficient Encapsulation,AdventureWorks.Dal.Adapter.DatabaseSpecific,DataAccessAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_RawDataAccessBencher\LLBLGenPro\DatabaseSpecific\DataAccessAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConnectionStringKeyName
Insufficient Modularization,AdventureWorks.Dal.Adapter.DatabaseSpecific,PersistenceInfoProviderCore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_RawDataAccessBencher\LLBLGenPro\DatabaseSpecific\PersistenceInfoProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
