Unnecessary Abstraction,FunWithAwaiters,ITransient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jskeet_DemoCode\Abusing CSharp\Code\FunWithAwaiters\ITransient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Broken Hierarchy,FunWithAwaiters,GotoExecutioner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jskeet_DemoCode\Abusing CSharp\Code\FunWithAwaiters\GotoExecutioner.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FunWithAwaiters.Executioner
Broken Hierarchy,FunWithAwaiters,GotoMethodExecutioner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jskeet_DemoCode\Abusing CSharp\Code\FunWithAwaiters\GotoMethodExecutioner.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FunWithAwaiters.Executioner
Rebellious Hierarchy,FunWithAwaiters,YieldingAwaiter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jskeet_DemoCode\Abusing CSharp\Code\FunWithAwaiters\YieldingAwaiter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetResult
