Imperative Abstraction,UnderTheHood,DecompilationSampleDecompiled,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jskeet_DemoCode\AsyncIntro\Code\UnderTheHood\DecompilationSampleDecompiled.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SumCharactersAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,UnderTheHood,DecompilationSampleDecompiled,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jskeet_DemoCode\AsyncIntro\Code\UnderTheHood\DecompilationSampleDecompiled.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
