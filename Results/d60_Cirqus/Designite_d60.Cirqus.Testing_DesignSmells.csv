Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,d60.Cirqus.Testing,TestingConfigurationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\TestingConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,d60.Cirqus.Testing,EventFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\TextFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Format which is more interested in members of the type: TextFormatter
Unutilized Abstraction,d60.Cirqus.Testing,CirqusTestsHarness,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\CirqusTestsHarness.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,CompatibilityExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,Diff,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: operation' text
Deficient Encapsulation,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,Patch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: diffs' start1' start2' length1' length2
Deficient Encapsulation,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,diff_match_patch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Diff_Timeout' Diff_EditCost' Match_Threshold' Match_Distance' Patch_DeleteThreshold' Patch_Margin
Insufficient Modularization,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,diff_match_patch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,diff_match_patch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,diff_match_patch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 261
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,d60.Cirqus.Testing,EventFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\TextFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: d60.Cirqus.Testing.EventFormatter' d60.Cirqus.Testing.TextFormatter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,Patch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils.Patch' EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils.diff_match_patch
Broken Hierarchy,d60.Cirqus.Testing,SynchronousViewManagerEventDispatcherConfiguationBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\SynchronousViewManagerEventDispatcherConfiguationBuilder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): d60.Cirqus.Config.Configurers.ConfigurationBuilder
Broken Hierarchy,EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils,Differ,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Testing\Differ.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EnergyProjects.Tests.Utils.diff_match_patch
