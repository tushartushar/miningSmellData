Unnecessary Abstraction,d60.Cirqus.Identity,Term,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\KeyFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,d60.Cirqus.Identity,GuidKeyword,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\KeyFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,d60.Cirqus.Identity,SGuidKeyword,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\KeyFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,d60.Cirqus.Identity,Switch<TReturn>,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\Switch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,d60.Cirqus.Identity,Id,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\Id.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: d60.Cirqus.Identity.Id' d60.Cirqus.Identity.KeyFormat
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,d60.Cirqus.Identity,Id,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\Id.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: d60.Cirqus.Identity.Id' d60.Cirqus.Identity.KeyFormat' d60.Cirqus.Identity.KeyFormatParser
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,d60.Cirqus.Identity,KeyFormat,C:\repos\d60_Cirqus\d60.Cirqus.Identity\KeyFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
