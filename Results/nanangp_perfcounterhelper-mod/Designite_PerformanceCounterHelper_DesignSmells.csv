Duplicate Abstraction,PerformanceCounterHelper.Impl,CounterHelperImpl,C:\repos\nanangp_perfcounterhelper-mod\PerformanceCounterHelper\Impl\CounterHelperImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CounterHelperImpl[176' 195]' CounterHelperImpl[218' 237]' CounterHelperImpl[329' 348]' CounterHelperImpl[599' 618]

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceCounterHelper,PerformanceCounterContainer,C:\repos\nanangp_perfcounterhelper-mod\PerformanceCounterHelper\PerformanceCounterContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceCounterContainer' CounterHelperImpl' CounterHelperFactory' PerformanceHelper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceCounterHelper,PerformanceHelper,C:\repos\nanangp_perfcounterhelper-mod\PerformanceCounterHelper\PerformanceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceHelper' CounterHelperImpl' CounterHelperFactory
Insufficient Modularization,PerformanceCounterHelper.Impl,CounterHelperImpl,C:\repos\nanangp_perfcounterhelper-mod\PerformanceCounterHelper\Impl\CounterHelperImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 107
