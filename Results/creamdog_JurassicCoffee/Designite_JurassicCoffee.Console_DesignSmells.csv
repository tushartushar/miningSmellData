Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,JurassicCoffee.Console,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Imperative Abstraction,JurassicCoffee.Console,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Insufficient Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 111
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionValueCollection' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,Option,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.Option' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionSet' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionValueCollection' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionSet' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionValueCollection' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext' JurassicCoffee.Console.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionSet' JurassicCoffee.Console.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JurassicCoffee.Console,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionValueCollection' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionSet' JurassicCoffee.Console.OptionContext' JurassicCoffee.Console.Option
Cyclic Hierarchy,JurassicCoffee.Console,Option,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Category
Rebellious Hierarchy,JurassicCoffee.Console,Category,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\creamdog_JurassicCoffee\Source\JurassicCoffee.Console\MonoOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnParseComplete
