Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,TidePowerd.Example.LinearAlgebra.Library,VectorNormExtensions,C:\repos\tidepowerd_GPU.NET-Example-Projects\LinearAlgebra.Library\VectorNormExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TidePowerd.Example.LinearAlgebra.Library,VectorNormExtensions,C:\repos\tidepowerd_GPU.NET-Example-Projects\LinearAlgebra.Library\VectorNormExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  VectorNormExtensions (C:\repos\tidepowerd_GPU.NET-Example-Projects\LinearAlgebra.Library\VectorNormExtensions.cs' [1' 34])' VectorOps (C:\repos\tidepowerd_GPU.NET-Example-Projects\LinearAlgebra.Library\VectorOps.cs' [1' 34])

Unnecessary Abstraction,TidePowerd.Example.LinearAlgebra.Library,MatrixOps,C:\repos\tidepowerd_GPU.NET-Example-Projects\LinearAlgebra.Library\MatrixOps.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
