Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,GameNetwork,TCPClient,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\Client\TCPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GameNetwork,TCPMessage,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\TCPMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' type' data
Unutilized Abstraction,GameNetwork,UDPClient,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\UDP\UDPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,GameNetwork,UDPClient,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\UDP\UDPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: UDPClient[51' 70]' UDPServer[52' 71]' UDPClient[74' 93]' UDPServer[74' 93]
Unutilized Abstraction,GameNetwork,UDPServer,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\UDP\UDPServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GameNetwork,MessageHelper,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\MessageHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: action
Deficient Encapsulation,GameNetwork,TCPClientSocket,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\Server\TCPClientSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: delaywatch
Deficient Encapsulation,GameNetwork,TCPMessage,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\TCPMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: type' data
Deficient Encapsulation,GameNetwork,TCPServer,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\Server\TCPServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Capacity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameNetwork,TCPClientSocket,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\Server\TCPClientSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TCPClientSocket' TCPServer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameNetwork,TCPClientSocket,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\Server\TCPClientSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TCPClientSocket' ITCPServerListener' TCPServer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameNetwork,ITCPServerListener,C:\repos\xysz0824_GameNetwork\network\TCP\Server\ITCPServerListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ITCPServerListener' TCPServer' TCPClientSocket' TCPServer' TCPClientSocket
