Unnecessary Abstraction,Web.Code.Base,UserControlBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\Code\Base\UserControlBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Page
Unutilized Abstraction,Web.Code.Base,UserControlBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\Code\Base\UserControlBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Web.Code,PartialHyperLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\Code\PartialHyperLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Web.Code,WebPageGrabber,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\Code\WebPageGrabber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Web,Global,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Web.UI.Admin,SetupUploadService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\UI\Admin\SetupUploadService.asmx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Web.UI.Main,UI_Main_404Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\UI\Main\404Helper.ascx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Web.UI.Main,DownloadSetup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\UI\Main\DownloadSetup.ashx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessRequest
Unutilized Abstraction,Web.UI.Main,DownloadSetup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\UI\Main\DownloadSetup.ashx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Web.Code.Base,PageBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaResourceEditor\Source\Web\Code\Base\PageBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Web.Code.Base.PageBase' Web.Code.PageLoadTaskPerformer
