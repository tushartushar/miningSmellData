Unutilized Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,ObjectComparerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\ObjectComparerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,ObjectComparerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\ObjectComparerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: IgnoreSpecificProperties which is more interested in members of the type: IObjectComparer
Unnecessary Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,ComplexNonBuiltInWithEnumerablePropertyClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\ObjectComparerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StringValues' ComplexValues
Unnecessary Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,NonBuiltInEmptyClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\ObjectComparerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,NonBuiltInClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\ObjectComparerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TheValue

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Inner
Unutilized Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,PropertyIgnoringTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\PropertyIgnoringTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,SimpleObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\PropertyIgnoringTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StringProperty1' StringProperty2
Unnecessary Abstraction,Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit,InheritsSimpleObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbarnwell_Regalo\Regalo.ObjectCompare.Tests.Unit\PropertyIgnoringTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
