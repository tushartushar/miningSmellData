Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,ClusterDescriptionParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\ClusterDescriptionParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,CoreExceptionHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\CoreExceptionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,DisposableBundle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\DisposableBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,FailPointName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\FailPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MaxTimeAlwaysTimeout' OnPrimaryTransactionalWrite
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,FailPointName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\FailPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,FailPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\FailPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers,ICoreSessionHandleExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\ICoreSessionHandleExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MongoDB.Driver.Core,EventNotifier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\EventCapturer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Initialize which is more interested in members of the type: EventCapturer
Imperative Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers.JsonDrivenTests,CommandStartedEventAsserter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\JsonDrivenTests\CommandStartedEventAsserter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConfigurePlaceholders
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers.JsonDrivenTests,EventAsserterFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\JsonDrivenTests\EventAsserterFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers.XunitExtensions,RequireServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\XunitExtensions\RequireServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers.XunitExtensions,RequireServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mongodb_mongo-csharp-driver\tests\MongoDB.Driver.Core.TestHelpers\XunitExtensions\RequireServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
