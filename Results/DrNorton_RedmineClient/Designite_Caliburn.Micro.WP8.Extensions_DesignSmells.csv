Missing Hierarchy,Caliburn.Micro,PhoneContainer,C:\repos\DrNorton_RedmineClient\Caliburn\Caliburn.Micro.WP8.Extensions\..\Caliburn.Micro.WP71.Extensions\PhoneContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: INavigationService' IPhoneService' IWindowManager' ISoundEffectPlayer (in method "RegisterPhoneServices" of class "PhoneContainer").
Missing Hierarchy,Caliburn.Micro,PhoneContainer,C:\repos\DrNorton_RedmineClient\Caliburn\Caliburn.Micro.WP8.Extensions\..\Caliburn.Micro.WP71.Extensions\PhoneContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IEventAggregator' IVibrateController (in method "RegisterPhoneServices" of class "PhoneContainer").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Caliburn.Micro,PhoneStateStorageMechanism,C:\repos\DrNorton_RedmineClient\Caliburn\Caliburn.Micro.WP8.Extensions\..\Caliburn.Micro.WP71.Extensions\PhoneStateStorageMechanism.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: EndStoring
Rebellious Hierarchy,Caliburn.Micro,StorageHandler,C:\repos\DrNorton_RedmineClient\Caliburn\Caliburn.Micro.WP8.Extensions\..\Caliburn.Micro.WP71.Extensions\StorageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
