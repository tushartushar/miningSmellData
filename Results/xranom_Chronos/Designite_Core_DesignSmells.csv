Unnecessary Abstraction,Chronos.Core.Application,ApplicationConfiguration,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Application\ApplicationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Width' Height' GraphicsMode' Title' Default
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chronos.Core.Component,IComponent,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Component\IComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Chronos.Core.Entity,EntitySet,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Entity\EntitySet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chronos.Core.Resource,IResource,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Resource\IResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Source
Deficient Encapsulation,Chronos.Core.Application,ApplicationConfiguration,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Application\ApplicationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Default
Deficient Encapsulation,Chronos.Core.Application,ApplicationConfiguration,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Application\ApplicationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Default
Deficient Encapsulation,Chronos.Core.Component,ComponentManager,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Component\ComponentManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: data
Deficient Encapsulation,Chronos.Core.Types,Color4,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Types\Color4.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Black' White' None' R' G' B' A
Deficient Encapsulation,Chronos.Core.Types,Color4,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Types\Color4.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Black' White' None
Broken Modularization,Chronos.Core.Application,ApplicationConfiguration,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Application\ApplicationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Width' Height' GraphicsMode' Title' Default
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Chronos.Core.Context,IContext,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Context\IContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IContext' ISystem
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Chronos.Core.Service,IService,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Service\IService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IService' IContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Chronos.Core.Service,IService,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Service\IService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IService' IContext' ISystem' IContext
Missing Hierarchy,Chronos.Core.Serialization,GameDataResolver,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Serialization\GameDataResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IResource' IComponent (in method "CreateContract" of class "GameDataResolver").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Chronos.Core.Service,Display,C:\repos\xranom_Chronos\Core\Service\Display.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialise
