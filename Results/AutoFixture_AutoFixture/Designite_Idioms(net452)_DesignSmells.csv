Imperative Abstraction,AutoFixture.Idioms,ConstructorInitializedMemberException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\ConstructorInitializedMemberException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetObjectData
Imperative Abstraction,AutoFixture.Idioms,CopyAndUpdateAssertion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\CopyAndUpdateAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Verify
Imperative Abstraction,AutoFixture.Idioms,CopyAndUpdateException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\CopyAndUpdateException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetObjectData
Duplicate Abstraction,AutoFixture.Idioms,GuardClauseAssertion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\GuardClauseAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GuardClauseAssertion (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\GuardClauseAssertion.cs' [294' 321])' GuardClauseAssertion (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\GuardClauseAssertion.cs' [331' 358])
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoFixture.Idioms,MethodInfoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\MethodInfoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoFixture.Idioms,SpecimenBuilderComposer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\SpecimenBuilderComposer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,AutoFixture.Idioms,CompositeIdiomaticAssertion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\CompositeIdiomaticAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods

Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Idioms,TaskReturnMethodInvokeCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\GuardClauseAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
Rebellious Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Idioms,IteratorMethodInvokeCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\GuardClauseAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
Wide Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Idioms,IdiomaticAssertion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\IdiomaticAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AutoFixture.Idioms.ConstructorInitializedMemberAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.CopyAndUpdateAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.EqualsNewObjectAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.EqualsNullAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.EqualsSelfAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.EqualsSuccessiveAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.GetHashCodeSuccessiveAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.GuardClauseAssertion' AutoFixture.Idioms.WritablePropertyAssertion' AutoFixture.IdiomsUnitTest.DelegatingIdiomaticAssertion
Rebellious Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Idioms,IdiomaticAssertion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\IdiomaticAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Verify' Verify' Verify' Verify
Unfactored Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Idioms,MethodInvokeCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\MethodInvokeCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  MethodInvokeCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\MethodInvokeCommand.cs' [78' 101])' PropertySetCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\Idioms\PropertySetCommand.cs' [69' 92])
