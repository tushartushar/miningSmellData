Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute,NSubstituteType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoNSubstitute\NSubstituteType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute,NSubstituteVirtualMethodsCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoNSubstitute\NSubstituteVirtualMethodsCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute,SubstituteAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoNSubstitute\SubstituteAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute.Extensions,MethodInfoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoNSubstitute\Extensions\MethodInfoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute,AutoConfiguredNSubstituteCustomization,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoNSubstitute\AutoConfiguredNSubstituteCustomization.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute.AutoNSubstituteCustomization
Rebellious Hierarchy,AutoFixture.AutoNSubstitute,SubstituteRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoNSubstitute\SubstituteRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
