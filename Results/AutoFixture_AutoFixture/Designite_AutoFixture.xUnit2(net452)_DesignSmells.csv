Imperative Abstraction,AutoFixture.Xunit2,AutoDataAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoFixture.xUnit2\AutoDataAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetData
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoFixture.Xunit2,EnumerableExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoFixture.xUnit2\EnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Rebellious Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Xunit2,CustomizeAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoFixture.xUnit2\CustomizeAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetCustomization
Broken Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Xunit2,InlineAutoDataAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoFixture.xUnit2\InlineAutoDataAttribute.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AutoFixture.Xunit2.CompositeDataAttribute
Broken Hierarchy,AutoFixture.Xunit2,MemberAutoDataAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutoFixture_AutoFixture\Src\AutoFixture.xUnit2\MemberAutoDataAttribute.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AutoFixture.Xunit2.CompositeDataAttribute
