Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr,MainActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\MainActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bikr,BikeTrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\BikeTrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' StartTime' EndTime' CommitTime' Distance
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr,DateTimeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\DateTimeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr,BikrBackupAgent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\BikrBackupAgent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Bikr,CirclesFragment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Fragments\CirclesFragment.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ShowLastTripNotification which is more interested in members of the type: PreferenceManager
Feature Envy,Bikr,CirclesFragment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Fragments\CirclesFragment.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadData which is more interested in members of the type: PreferenceManager
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr,CircleLinearLayout,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Views\CircleLinearLayout.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr,ManagerServiceReceiver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Cycling\ManagerServiceReceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Bikr,BikeTrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\BikeTrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' StartTime' EndTime' CommitTime' Distance
Broken Modularization,Bikr,TripDistanceStats,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\DataApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Daily' Weekly' Monthly' PrevDay' PrevWeek' PrevMonth
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Bikr,BikrActivityService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Cycling\BikrActivityService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Bikr.BikrActivityService' Bikr.ActivityRecognitionHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bikr,WaveDrawable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Drawables\WaveDrawable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetColorFilter
