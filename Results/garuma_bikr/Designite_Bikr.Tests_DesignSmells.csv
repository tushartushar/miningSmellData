Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DataApiTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs' [86' 114])' DataApiTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs' [161' 189])
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddTripTest which is more interested in members of the type: DataApi
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetTripsAfterTest which is more interested in members of the type: DataApi
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetStatsTest which is more interested in members of the type: DataApi
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetStatsTest_BetweenMonth which is more interested in members of the type: DataApi
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JustAddedTripWithNoCommitTest which is more interested in members of the type: DataApi
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,DataApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\DataApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetAggregatedStatsTest which is more interested in members of the type: DataApi
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr.Tests,PreferenceManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\PreferencesManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Bikr.Tests,PreferenceManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\PreferencesManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertLastMeasures which is more interested in members of the type: PreferenceManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bikr,BikeTrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\BikeTrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' StartTime' EndTime' CommitTime' Distance
Unutilized Abstraction,Bikr,DateTimeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\DateTimeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Bikr.Tests,MainActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\MainActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MainContext
Deficient Encapsulation,Bikr.Tests,MainActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr.Tests\MainActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MainContext
Broken Modularization,Bikr,BikeTrip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\BikeTrip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' StartTime' EndTime' CommitTime' Distance
Broken Modularization,Bikr,TripDistanceStats,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\garuma_bikr\Bikr\Models\DataApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Daily' Weekly' Monthly' PrevDay' PrevWeek' PrevMonth
