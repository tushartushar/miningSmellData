Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: DebugEngine.Engine' DebugEngine.Management
Cyclic Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Node,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: DebugEngine.Node' DebugEngine.Node.Debugger
Cyclic Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Node.Debugger.Serialization,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: DebugEngine.Node.Debugger.Serialization' DebugEngine.Node.Debugger
Unstable Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Management,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DebugEngine.Engine
Unstable Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Node,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DebugEngine.Node.Debugger' DebugEngine.Node.Debugger.Communication
Unstable Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Node.Debugger.Serialization,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DebugEngine.Node.Debugger
Unstable Dependency,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Node.Debugger,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DebugEngine.Node.Debugger.Communication
God Component,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 44
Scattered Functionality,DebugEngine,DebugEngine.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: DebugEngine.Node' DebugEngine.Management
