Broken Modularization,Examples,ClassWithUnsafeFields,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Field_modifiers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UnsafePublicField' UnsafePublicByteField' UnsafePublicIntField' UnsafePublicLongField' UnsafeProtectedField
Broken Modularization,Examples,FieldOrderExample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Field_order.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ZZ_Field' YY_Field' AA_Field' i_Field' I_Field
Broken Modularization,Examples,ClassWithFields,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Field_visibility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' privateFieldNotVisible' internalFieldNotVisible' privateProtectedFieldNotVisible' protectedFieldIsVisible' protectedInternalFieldIsVisible' publicFieldIsVisible
Wide Hierarchy,PublicApiGeneratorTests,ApiGeneratorTestsBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\ApiGeneratorTestsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: PublicApiGeneratorTests.Assembly_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Assembly_member_ordering' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_constructors' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_events' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_event_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_generics' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_hierarchy' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_member_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_modifiers' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_nested' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Class_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Delegate_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Delegate_types' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Delegate_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Dynamics' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Enum' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Event_modifiers' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Event_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Field_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Field_modifiers' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Field_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Field_types' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Field_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Indexer_properties' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_events' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_event_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_generics' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_hierarchy' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_member_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_methods' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_method_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_method_generics' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_method_parameters' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_method_return_value_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_properties' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_property_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_variance' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Interface_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Keyword_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_async' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_explicit_interfaces' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_extensions' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_generics' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_modifiers' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_parameters' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_parameter_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_return_types' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_return_value_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Method_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Namespaces' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Namespaces_whitelisting' PublicApiGeneratorTests.NullableTests' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Operator_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Operator_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Property_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Property_automatic' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Property_methods' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Property_modifiers' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Property_types' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Property_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Struct_attributes' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Struct_hierarchy' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Struct_member_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Struct_order' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Struct_readonly' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Struct_visibility' PublicApiGeneratorTests.Well_known_attributes
Unfactored Hierarchy,PublicApiGeneratorTests,Field_modifiers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Field_modifiers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  Field_modifiers (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Field_modifiers.cs' [33' 68])' Keyword_order (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Keyword_order.cs' [19' 54])
Rebellious Hierarchy,Examples,ClassWithAbstractOverridingMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\Method_modifiers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoSomething
Rebellious Hierarchy,Examples,NullableApi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGeneratorTests\NullableTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Equals' GetHashCode
