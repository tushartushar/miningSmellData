Imperative Abstraction,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGenerator,F:\newReposMay17\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GeneratePublicApi
Unutilized Abstraction,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGenerator,F:\newReposMay17\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Insufficient Modularization,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGenerator,F:\newReposMay17\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGenerator,F:\newReposMay17\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 130
