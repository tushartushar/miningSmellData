Unutilized Abstraction,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGeneratorOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGeneratorOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IncludeTypes' IncludeAssemblyAttributes' WhitelistedNamespacePrefixes' ExcludeAttributes' DefaultWhitelistedNamespacePrefixes
Unutilized Abstraction,PublicApiGenerator,CodeTypeDeclarationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\CodeTypeDeclarationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PublicApiGenerator,CodeTypeReferenceBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\CodeTypeReferenceBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Broken Modularization,PublicApiGenerator,ApiGeneratorOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_ApiApprover\src\PublicApiGenerator\ApiGeneratorOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IncludeTypes' IncludeAssemblyAttributes' WhitelistedNamespacePrefixes' ExcludeAttributes' DefaultWhitelistedNamespacePrefixes
