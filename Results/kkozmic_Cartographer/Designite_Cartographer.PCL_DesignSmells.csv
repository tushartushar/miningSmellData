(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cartographer.Internal,MappingContextMeta,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Internal\MappingContextMeta.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Argument' Mapper' SourceInstance' TargetInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,Cartographer.Internal.Extensions,AssemblyExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Internal\Extensions\AssemblyExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cartographer.Internal.Extensions,PropertyInfoExtenions,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Internal\Extensions\PropertyInfoExtenions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cartographer.Patterns,CollectionConversionPattern,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Patterns\CollectionConversionPattern.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cartographer.Patterns,MapConversionPattern,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Patterns\MapConversionPattern.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cartographer.Patterns,NullableConversionPattern,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Patterns\NullableConversionPattern.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Cartographer.Compiler,DescriptionVisitor,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Compiler\DescriptionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PropertyIfNotNullInnerExpression' PropertyIfNotNullExpression (in method "VisitExtension" of class "DescriptionVisitor").
Deficient Encapsulation,Cartographer.Internal.Extensions,TypeExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Internal\Extensions\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EmptyTypes
Deficient Encapsulation,Cartographer.Internal.Extensions,TypeExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Internal\Extensions\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: EmptyTypes
Insufficient Modularization,Cartographer.Compiler,DescriptionVisitor,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Compiler\DescriptionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 49 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cartographer.Compiler,DescriptionVisitor,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Compiler\DescriptionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 300
Rebellious Hierarchy,Cartographer.Compiler,ConversionPatternRepository,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Compiler\ConversionPatternRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Recycle
Rebellious Hierarchy,Cartographer.Internal.Expressions,ReducibleExpression,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Internal\Expressions\ReducibleExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Reduce
Unfactored Hierarchy,Cartographer.Steps,ConstructorAssignChain,F:\newReposMay17\kkozmic_Cartographer\src\Cartographer\Steps\ConstructorAssignChain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ConstructorAssignChain[42' 80]' AssignChain[42' 80]
