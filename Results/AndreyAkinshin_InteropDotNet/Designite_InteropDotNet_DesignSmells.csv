This class contains only the following public method: CreateInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,InteropDotNet,InteropRuntimeImplementer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndreyAkinshin_InteropDotNet\InteropDotNet\InteropRuntimeImplementer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,InteropDotNet,RuntimeDllImportAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndreyAkinshin_InteropDotNet\InteropDotNet\RuntimeDllImportAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EntryPoint' CallingConvention' CharSet' SetLastError' BestFitMapping' ThrowOnUnmappableChar
Broken Modularization,InteropDotNet,MethodItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndreyAkinshin_InteropDotNet\InteropDotNet\InteropRuntimeImplementer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Info' DllImportAttribute' DelegateType' FieldInfo' Name' ReturnType
