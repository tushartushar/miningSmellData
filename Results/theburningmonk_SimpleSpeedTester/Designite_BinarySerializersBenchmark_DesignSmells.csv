Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,BinarySerializersSpeedTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,BinarySerializersSpeedTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,SimpleObjectWithFields,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Name' Address' Scores
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,SimpleObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Address' Scores
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,SimpleObjectWithFields,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Name' Address' Scores
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,SimpleObjectWithFieldsStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Name' Address' Scores
Insufficient Modularization,SimpleSpeedTester.Example,BinarySerializersSpeedTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\theburningmonk_SimpleSpeedTester\examples\BinarySerializersBenchmark\BinarySerializersSpeedTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 52 methods
