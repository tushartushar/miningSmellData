Unutilized Abstraction,nHydrate.Wizard,WizardDesigner,C:\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\Wizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,nHydrate.Wizard,WizardPageDesigner,C:\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\WizardPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SelectionRules
