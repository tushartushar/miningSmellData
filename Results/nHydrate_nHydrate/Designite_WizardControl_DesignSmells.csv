Duplicate Abstraction,nHydrate.Wizard,Wizard,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\Wizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Wizard (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\Wizard.cs' [1' 26])' WizardPageStyle (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\WizardPage.cs' [1' 26])' WizardPagesCollection (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\WizardPagesCollection.cs' [1' 26])

Unnecessary Abstraction,nHydrate.Wizard,WizardPageDesigner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\WizardPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SelectionRules
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,nHydrate.Wizard,Wizard,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\Wizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: nHydrate.Wizard.Wizard' nHydrate.Wizard.WizardPage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,nHydrate.Wizard,WizardPagesCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\WizardPagesCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: nHydrate.Wizard.WizardPagesCollection' nHydrate.Wizard.Wizard
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,nHydrate.Wizard,Wizard,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\Wizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: nHydrate.Wizard.Wizard' nHydrate.Wizard.WizardPage' nHydrate.Wizard.WizardPagesCollection
Missing Hierarchy,nHydrate.Wizard,WizardPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nHydrate_nHydrate\Source\WizardControl\WizardPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Wizard' Wizard (in method "OnPaint" of class "WizardPage").
