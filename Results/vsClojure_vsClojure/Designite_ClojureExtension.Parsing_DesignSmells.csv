Imperative Abstraction,ClojureExtension.Parsing,Lexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Parsing\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Next
Feature Envy,ClojureExtension.Parsing,Lexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Parsing\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ReadChars which is more interested in members of the type: PushBackCharacterStream

Deficient Encapsulation,ClojureExtension.Parsing,NamespaceParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Parsing\NamespaceParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NamespaceSymbols
Deficient Encapsulation,ClojureExtension.Parsing,NamespaceParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Parsing\NamespaceParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NamespaceSymbols
