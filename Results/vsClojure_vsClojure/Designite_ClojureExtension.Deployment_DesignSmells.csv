Unnecessary Abstraction,ClojureExtension.Deployment.Configuration,GeneralPropertyPageAdapter,C:\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Deployment\Configuration\GeneralPropertyPageAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Rebellious Hierarchy,ClojureExtension.Deployment,ClojureLanguage,C:\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Deployment\ClojureLanguage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetScanner' ParseSource
Broken Hierarchy,ClojureExtension.Deployment.Configuration,GeneralPropertyPageAdapter,C:\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Deployment\Configuration\GeneralPropertyPageAdapter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ClojureExtension.Project.Configuration.GeneralPropertyPage
