Deficient Encapsulation,ClojureExtension.Utilities,CommandIDs,C:\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Utilities\CommandIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FormatDocument' BlockComment' BlockUncomment' GotoDefinition' StartReplUsingProjectVersion' LoadProjectIntoActiveRepl' LoadFileIntoActiveRepl' LoadActiveDocumentIntoRepl' SwitchReplNamespaceToActiveDocument' LoadSelectedTextIntoRepl
Deficient Encapsulation,ClojureExtension.Utilities,CommandIDs,C:\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Utilities\CommandIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: FormatDocument' BlockComment' BlockUncomment' GotoDefinition' StartReplUsingProjectVersion' LoadProjectIntoActiveRepl' LoadFileIntoActiveRepl' LoadActiveDocumentIntoRepl' SwitchReplNamespaceToActiveDocument' LoadSelectedTextIntoRepl
Broken Modularization,ClojureExtension.Utilities,CommandIDs,C:\repos\vsClojure_vsClojure\ClojureExtension.Utilities\CommandIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' FormatDocument' BlockComment' BlockUncomment' GotoDefinition' StartReplUsingProjectVersion' LoadProjectIntoActiveRepl' LoadFileIntoActiveRepl' LoadActiveDocumentIntoRepl' SwitchReplNamespaceToActiveDocument' LoadSelectedTextIntoRepl
