Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,VesselView,ViewerSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\ViewerSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: getPropertyDesc
Unutilized Abstraction,VesselView,VesselViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\VesselViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,VesselView,VesselViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\VesselViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: nilOffset which is more interested in members of the type: ViewerSettings
Feature Envy,VesselView,VesselViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\VesselViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: manuallyOffset which is more interested in members of the type: ViewerSettings
Deficient Encapsulation,VesselView,CustomModeSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\CustomModeSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name' ColorModeOverride' OrientationOverride' CenteringOverride' MinimodesOverride' staticSettings' fillColorDelegate' wireColorDelegate' boxColorDelegate' fillColorDullDelegate' wireColorDullDelegate' boxColorDullDelegate' drawPlaneDelegate' spinAxisDelegate' spinSpeedDelegate' displayCOMDelegate' displayEnginesDelegate' displayAxesDelegate' displayGroundDelegate' centerOnRootHDelegate' centerOnRootVDelegate' centerRescaleDelegate' marginDelegate' autoCenterDelegate' focusSubset' dataInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,VesselView,ViewerConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\ViewerConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VERSION' MAX_ALTITUDE
Deficient Encapsulation,VesselView,ViewerConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\ViewerConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VERSION' MAX_ALTITUDE
Deficient Encapsulation,VesselView,RectColor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\ViewerConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rect' color
Deficient Encapsulation,VesselView,ViewerSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\ViewerSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: colorModeFill' colorModeWire' colorModeBox' colorModeFillDull' colorModeWireDull' colorModeBoxDull' drawPlane' spinAxis' spinSpeed' displayCOM' displayEngines' displayAxes' displayGround' centerOnRootH' centerOnRootV' centerRescale' margin' autoCenter' scalePos' scaleFact' scrOffX' scrOffY' latency' screenVisible' configScreenVisible
Deficient Encapsulation,VesselView,VesselViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\VesselViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: basicSettings' customMode
Broken Modularization,VesselView,CustomModeSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\CustomModeSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name' ColorModeOverride' OrientationOverride' CenteringOverride' MinimodesOverride' staticSettings' fillColorDelegate' wireColorDelegate' boxColorDelegate' fillColorDullDelegate' wireColorDullDelegate' boxColorDullDelegate' drawPlaneDelegate' spinAxisDelegate' spinSpeedDelegate' displayCOMDelegate' displayEnginesDelegate' displayAxesDelegate' displayGroundDelegate' centerOnRootHDelegate' centerOnRootVDelegate' centerRescaleDelegate' marginDelegate' autoCenterDelegate' focusSubset' dataInstance
Insufficient Modularization,VesselView,VesselViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\VesselViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,VesselView,VesselViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VesselView\VesselViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 306
