Duplicate Abstraction,VVPartSelector,VViewMenuPartSelectorGlobal,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VViewMenuPartSelectorGlobal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  VViewMenuPartSelectorGlobal (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VViewMenuPartSelectorGlobal.cs' [188' 207])' VVsinglePartSubmenu (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VVsinglePartSubmenu.cs' [191' 210])' VViewMenuPartSelectorTree (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VViewMenuPartSelectorTree.cs' [318' 337])' VViewMenuPartSelectorTree (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VViewMenuPartSelectorTree.cs' [407' 426])
Unutilized Abstraction,VVPartSelector,VVPartSelector,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VVPartSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,VVPartSelector,CustomPartTree,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\CustomPartTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: selectedItem
Deficient Encapsulation,VVPartSelector,CustomPartTreeItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\CustomPartTreeItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: root' children' actionCount' associatedPart' childrnExpanded' actionsExpanded' hasChildrn' hasActions' selectedLine' selectionMode
Insufficient Modularization,VVPartSelector,VViewMenuPartSelectorTree,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VViewMenuPartSelectorTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 122
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VVPartSelector,CustomPartTreeItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\CustomPartTreeItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VVPartSelector.CustomPartTreeItem' VVPartSelector.VViewMenuPartSelectorTree
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VVPartSelector,SelectorDataContainer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\SelectorDataContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VVPartSelector.SelectorDataContainer' VVPartSelector.VViewMenuPartSelectorGlobal
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VVPartSelector,VVsinglePartSubmenu,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\VVsinglePartSubmenu.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VVPartSelector.VVsinglePartSubmenu' VVPartSelector.SelectorDataContainer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VVPartSelector,CustomPartTree,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\CustomPartTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VVPartSelector.CustomPartTree' VVPartSelector.VViewMenuPartSelectorTree' VVPartSelector.CustomPartTreeItem
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VVPartSelector,CustomPartTreeItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PeteTimesSix_VesselViewer\VVPartSelector\CustomPartTreeItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
