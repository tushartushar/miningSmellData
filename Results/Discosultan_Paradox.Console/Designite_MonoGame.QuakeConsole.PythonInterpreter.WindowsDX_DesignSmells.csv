Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,QuakeConsole,Member,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Member.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' MemberType' ParameterInfo' IsInstance
Feature Envy,QuakeConsole,TypeLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\TypeLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddVariable which is more interested in members of the type: PythonInterpreter
Feature Envy,QuakeConsole,TypeLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\TypeLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RemoveVariable which is more interested in members of the type: PythonInterpreter
Unutilized Abstraction,QuakeConsole,Utilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QuakeConsole,AutocompletionContextResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\AutocompletionContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Context' StartIndex
Broken Modularization,QuakeConsole,Member,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Member.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' MemberType' ParameterInfo' IsInstance
