Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,QuakeConsole,Member,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Member.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' MemberType' ParameterInfo' IsInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,QuakeConsole,Utilities,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QuakeConsole,AutocompletionContextResult,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\AutocompletionContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Context' StartIndex
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuakeConsole,Autocompleter,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Autocompleter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuakeConsole.Autocompleter' QuakeConsole.PythonInterpreter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuakeConsole,Autocompleter,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Autocompleter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuakeConsole.Autocompleter' QuakeConsole.PythonInterpreter' QuakeConsole.TypeLoader
Broken Modularization,QuakeConsole,Member,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\Member.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' MemberType' ParameterInfo' IsInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuakeConsole,PythonInterpreter,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\PythonInterpreter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuakeConsole.PythonInterpreter' QuakeConsole.Autocompleter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuakeConsole,TypeLoader,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\TypeLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuakeConsole.TypeLoader' QuakeConsole.PythonInterpreter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuakeConsole,TypeLoader,C:\repos\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\PythonInterpreter\TypeLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuakeConsole.TypeLoader' QuakeConsole.PythonInterpreter' QuakeConsole.Autocompleter
