Unnecessary Abstraction,QuakeConsole,ExpandoWrapper,F:\newReposMay17\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\RoslynInterpreter\RoslynInterpreter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' globals
Unnecessary Abstraction,QuakeConsole,Member,F:\newReposMay17\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\RoslynInterpreter\TypeLoading\Member.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' MemberType' ParameterInfo' IsInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,QuakeConsole,Utilities,F:\newReposMay17\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\RoslynInterpreter\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QuakeConsole,AutocompletionContextResult,F:\newReposMay17\Discosultan_Paradox.Console\Interpreters\RoslynInterpreter\Autocompletion\AutocompletionContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Context' StartIndex
