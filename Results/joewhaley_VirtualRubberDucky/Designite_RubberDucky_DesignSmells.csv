Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,RubberDucky,DuckyScript,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\DuckyScript.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DuckyScript[297' 321]' DuckyScript[344' 368]
Imperative Abstraction,RubberDucky,RubberDuckyForm,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\RubberDuckyForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProgressDelegate
Multifaceted Abstraction,RubberDucky,NativeMethods,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unnecessary Abstraction,RubberDucky.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,RubberDucky,DuckyScript,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\DuckyScript.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: sim' DefaultDelay' UseDirectKeyMode' DefaultKeystrokeDelay
Deficient Encapsulation,RubberDucky,NativeMethods,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MOD_ALT' MOD_CONTROL' MOD_SHIFT' MOD_WIN' WM_HOTKEY
Deficient Encapsulation,RubberDucky,NativeMethods,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MOD_ALT' MOD_CONTROL' MOD_SHIFT' MOD_WIN' WM_HOTKEY
Insufficient Modularization,RubberDucky,NativeMethods,C:\repos\joewhaley_VirtualRubberDucky\RubberDucky\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
