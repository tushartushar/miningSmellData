Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chinchilla.Api,BindingOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\BindingOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RoutingKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chinchilla.Api,Connection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chinchilla.Api,MessageProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\MessageProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ContentType
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chinchilla.Api,QueueOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\QueueOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' AutoDelete' Durable
Unutilized Abstraction,Chinchilla.Api.Extensions,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\Extensions\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chinchilla.Api.Extensions,StringInjectExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\Extensions\StringInjectExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Chinchilla.Api,Message,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PayloadBytes' Redelivered' Exchange' RoutingKey' MessageCount' MessageProperties' Payload
Insufficient Modularization,Chinchilla.Api,RabbitAdmin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonnii_chinchilla\src\Chinchilla.Api\RabbitAdmin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
