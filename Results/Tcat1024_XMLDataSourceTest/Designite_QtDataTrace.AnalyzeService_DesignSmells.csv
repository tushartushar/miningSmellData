Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,ConnectionString,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\ConnectionString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LYQ_DB' LYQ_OLEDB' LYQ_HISTORAIN
Unutilized Abstraction,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,ConfigException,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataTraceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,ConnectionString,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\ConnectionString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LYQ_DB' LYQ_OLEDB' LYQ_HISTORAIN
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,ConnectionString,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\ConnectionString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LYQ_DB' LYQ_OLEDB' LYQ_HISTORAIN
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,CCTAnalyzeFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataAnalyzeBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,KMeansAnalyzeFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataAnalyzeBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,ContourPlotFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataAnalyzeBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,RpartFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataAnalyzeBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,LmRegressFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataAnalyzeBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Insufficient Modularization,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,DataTraceFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataTraceBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService,DataTraceFactory,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.AnalyzeService\DataTraceBLL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataTraceFactory' LocalizationDataTraceService
