Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI,DataAnalysisStartUpAdv,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\DataAnalysisStartUpAdv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Unutilized Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI,DataAnalysisStartUpAdv,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\DataAnalysisStartUpAdv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI,ProcessQtTableConfig,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\ProcessQtTableConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI,ProcessQtTableConfig,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\ProcessQtTableConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ProcessQtTableConfig[205' 228]' ProcessQtTableConfig[233' 256]
Imperative Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI,TriStateTreeView,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\TriStateTreeView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Refresh
Unutilized Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI,TriStateTreeView,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\TriStateTreeView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,QtDataTrace.UI.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ConnectionString' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.UI,TraceDataBackUpForm,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\TraceDataBackUpForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RemoveTables' SaveTable
Deficient Encapsulation,QtDataTrace.UI,TraceDataLoadForm,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\TraceDataLoadForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TableName
Insufficient Modularization,QtDataTrace.UI,DataAnalysisStartUpAdv,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\DataAnalysisStartUpAdv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,QtDataTrace.UI,DataAnalysisStartUpAdv,C:\repos\Tcat1024_XMLDataSourceTest\QtDataTrace.UI\DataAnalysisStartUpAdv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 208
