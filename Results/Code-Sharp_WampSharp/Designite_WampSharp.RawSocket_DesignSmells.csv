Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,ArraySegmentExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\ArraySegmentExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,HandshakeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\HandshakeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,NetworkStreamExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\NetworkStreamExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,RawSocketTransport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\RawSocketTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,SerializerTypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\SerializerTypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,SslConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\SslConfiguration\SslConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EnabledSslProtocols' CheckCertificateRevocation' DefaultSslProtocols
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,SslStreamExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\SslStreamExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,TcpClientConnection<TMessage>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\TcpClientConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: HandleTcpClientAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.V2.Fluent,RawSocketChannelFactoryExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\WAMP2\V2\Fluent\RawSocketChannelFactoryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WampSharp.V2.Fluent,IRawSocketTransportConnectFromSyntax,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\WAMP2\V2\Fluent\IRawSocketTransportConnectFromSyntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WampSharp.V2.Fluent.IRawSocketTransportConnectFromSyntax' WampSharp.V2.Fluent.IRawSocketTransportSyntax
Cyclic Hierarchy,WampSharp.V2.Fluent,IRawSocketTransportConnectFromSyntax,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\WAMP2\V2\Fluent\IRawSocketTransportConnectFromSyntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IRawSocketTransportSyntax
Multipath Hierarchy,WampSharp.V2.Fluent,RawSocketTransportSyntax,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\WAMP2\V2\Fluent\RawSocketTransportSyntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IRawSocketTransportConnectFromSyntax
