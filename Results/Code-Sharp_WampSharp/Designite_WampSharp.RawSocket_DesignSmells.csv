Imperative Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,TcpClientConnection,F:\newReposMay17\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\mono\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\..\..\..\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\TcpClientConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: HandleTcpClientAsync

Unexploited Encapsulation,WampSharp.RawSocket,RawSocketClientConnection,F:\newReposMay17\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\mono\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\..\..\..\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.RawSocket\RawSocket\RawSocketClientConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: JsonBinding' MsgPackBinding (in method "RawSocketClientConnection" of class "RawSocketClientConnection").
