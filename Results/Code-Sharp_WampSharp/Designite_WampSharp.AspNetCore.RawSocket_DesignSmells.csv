Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket,AspNetCoreRawSocketTransport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket\AspNetCoreRawSocketTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket,AspNetCoreRawSocketTransport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket\AspNetCoreRawSocketTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RawSocketHandler which is more interested in members of the type: Handshaker
Imperative Abstraction,WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket,RawSocketConnection<TMessage>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket\RawSocketConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RunAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket,ReadOnlyMemoryExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket\ReadOnlyMemoryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.RawSocket,RawSocketFrameHeaderParserExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket\RawSocketFrameHeaderParserExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket,MemoryBufferWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.AspNetCore.RawSocket\MemoryBufferWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' FlushAsync' Read' Seek' SetLength
