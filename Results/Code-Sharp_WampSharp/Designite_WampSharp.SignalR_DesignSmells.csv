Unnecessary Abstraction,WampSharp.SignalR,ConnectionListenerSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.SignalR\Server\ConnectionListenerSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EnableCors' EnableJSONP' PathMatch
Unutilized Abstraction,WampSharp.SignalR,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.SignalR\Server\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,WampSharp.SignalR,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code-Sharp_WampSharp\src\net45\Extensions\WampSharp.SignalR\Server\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Configuration which is more interested in members of the type: ConnectionListenerSettings
