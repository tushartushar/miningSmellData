Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,LuaInterface.Tests,TestLuaInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevedonovan_MonoLuaInterface\tests\TestLua.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestEventException which is more interested in members of the type: Lua
Deficient Encapsulation,LuaInterface.Tests,TestStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevedonovan_MonoLuaInterface\tests\TestLua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: v
Deficient Encapsulation,LuaInterface.Tests,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevedonovan_MonoLuaInterface\tests\TestLua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: val
Insufficient Modularization,LuaInterface.Tests,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevedonovan_MonoLuaInterface\tests\TestLua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LuaInterface.Tests,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevedonovan_MonoLuaInterface\tests\TestLua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LuaInterface.Tests,ITest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevedonovan_MonoLuaInterface\tests\TestLua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LuaInterface.Tests.ITest' LuaInterface.Tests.TestClass
