Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Exchange.DkimSigner,DkimSigningRoutingAgent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pro_dkim-exchange\Src\Exchange.DkimSigner\DkimSigningRoutingAgent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SignMailItem which is more interested in members of the type: DkimSigner
Unutilized Abstraction,Exchange.DkimSigner,DkimSigningRoutingAgentFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pro_dkim-exchange\Src\Exchange.DkimSigner\DkimSigningRoutingAgentFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Exchange.DkimSigner,DkimSigningRoutingAgentFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pro_dkim-exchange\Src\Exchange.DkimSigner\DkimSigningRoutingAgentFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadSettings which is more interested in members of the type: DkimSigner
Unnecessary Abstraction,Exchange.DkimSigner.Tests,TestDkimSigner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pro_dkim-exchange\Src\Exchange.DkimSigner\Tests\TestDkimSigner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Deficient Encapsulation,Exchange.DkimSigner,Logger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pro_dkim-exchange\Src\Exchange.DkimSigner\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LogLevel
Deficient Encapsulation,Exchange.DkimSigner,Logger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pro_dkim-exchange\Src\Exchange.DkimSigner\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LogLevel
