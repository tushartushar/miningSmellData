Imperative Abstraction,ProxySwitcher,MainWindowRibbon,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\MainWindowRibbon.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetStatusText
Multifaceted Abstraction,ProxySwitcher,MainWindowRibbon,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\MainWindowRibbon.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProxySwitcher.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ProxySwitcher,App,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: App' RemotingService
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ProxySwitcher,SettingsConfigurationControl,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\SettingsConfigurationControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SettingsConfigurationControl' MainWindowRibbon
Insufficient Modularization,ProxySwitcher,MainWindowRibbon,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\MainWindowRibbon.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ProxySwitcher,MainWindowRibbon,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\MainWindowRibbon.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 130
Missing Hierarchy,ProxySwitcher,MainWindowRibbon,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\MainWindowRibbon.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: UnknownNetworkTreeViewItem' NetworkTreeViewItem (in method "treeViewNetworks_SelectedItemChanged" of class "MainWindowRibbon").
Missing Hierarchy,ProxySwitcher,MainWindowRibbon,C:\repos\mwiedemeyer_ProxySwitcher\ProxySwitcher\MainWindowRibbon.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: NetworkTreeViewItem' ActionTreeViewItem (in method "AddAction" of class "MainWindowRibbon").
