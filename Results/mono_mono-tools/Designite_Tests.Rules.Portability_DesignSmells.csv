Unnecessary Abstraction,Test.Rules.Portability,CommonMainClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\rules\Gendarme.Rules.Portability\Test\ExitCodeIsLimitedOnUnixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Unnecessary Abstraction,Test.Rules.Portability,ProcessLookAlike,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\rules\Gendarme.Rules.Portability\Test\FeatureRequiresRootPrivilegeOnUnixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PriorityClass
Unutilized Abstraction,Test.Rules.Portability,FeatureRequiresRootPrivilegeOnUnixTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\rules\Gendarme.Rules.Portability\Test\FeatureRequiresRootPrivilegeOnUnixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,Test.Rules.Portability,MonoCompatibilityReviewTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\rules\Gendarme.Rules.Portability\Test\MonoCompatibilityReviewTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetUp which is more interested in members of the type: MonoCompatibilityReviewRule
Unutilized Abstraction,Test.Rules.Portability,NewLineLiteralTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\rules\Gendarme.Rules.Portability\Test\NewLineLiteralTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
