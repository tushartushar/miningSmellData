Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\console\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OptionValueCollection (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\console\Options.cs' [8' 28])' DefectsToIgnoreList (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\tools\supported\gd2i\gd2i.cs' [8' 28])
Feature Envy,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\console\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\console\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\console\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
