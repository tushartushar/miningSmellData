Unutilized Abstraction,heapsnapshotexplorer,MyClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\MyClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,Gui,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,BinContainer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,ActionGroups,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Profiler,IRootNode,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\HeapExplorerTreeModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PreviousAllocationsNode
Broken Modularization,Mono.Profiler,INode,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\HeapExplorerTreeModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Items' Description' TreeIter' Parent' Root' Count' AllocatedBytes' ContextMenu
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Profiler,HeapSnapshotExplorer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\HeapSnapshotExplorer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Profiler.HeapSnapshotExplorer' Mono.Profiler.HeapExplorerTreeModel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Profiler,LoadedClassChooser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\LoadedClassChooser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Profiler.LoadedClassChooser' Mono.Profiler.HeapSnapshotExplorer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Profiler,HeapExplorerTreeModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\HeapExplorerTreeModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Profiler.HeapExplorerTreeModel' Mono.Profiler.HeapSnapshotExplorer' Mono.Profiler.LoadedClassChooser
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mono.Profiler,HeapEventProcessor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\Mono.Profiler\heap-snapshot-explorer\HeapExplorerTreeModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: HeapObjectReachable
