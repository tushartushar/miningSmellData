Feature Envy,Test.Rules.Fixtures,RuleTestFixture<TRule;TMetadataToken>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_mono-tools\gendarme\rules\Test.Rules\Fixtures\RuleTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunRule which is more interested in members of the type: TestRunner
