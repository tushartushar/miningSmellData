Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting,ExceptionAssert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Thwaitesy_MSTestHacks\MSTestHacks\Asserts\ExceptionAssert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MSTestHacks,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Thwaitesy_MSTestHacks\MSTestHacks\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MSTestHacks,TestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Thwaitesy_MSTestHacks\MSTestHacks\TestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MSTestHacks.RuntimeDataSource,AttachRuntimeDataSources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Thwaitesy_MSTestHacks\MSTestHacks\RuntimeDataSource\AttachRuntimeDataSources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MSTestHacks.RuntimeDataSource.AttachRuntimeDataSources' MSTestHacks.TestBase
