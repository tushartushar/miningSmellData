Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE,ClaudiaIdePackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIdePackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ClaudiaIDE,ClaudiaIdePackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIdePackage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ChangeImage which is more interested in members of the type: Setting
Feature Envy,ClaudiaIDE,SildeShowImageProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\ImageProvider\SildeShowImageProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetImagesFromDirectory which is more interested in members of the type: Setting
Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE,ClaudiaIDEAdornmentFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDEFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE,VSPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\VSPackage.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE,VSPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\VSPackage.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  VSPackage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\VSPackage.Designer.cs' [43' 63])' ResLocalized (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Localized\ResLocalized.Designer.cs' [43' 63])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE.Helpers,AnimateImageChangeParams,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Helpers\AnimateImageChangeParams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TargetOpacity' FadeTime
Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE.Helpers,DependencyObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Helpers\DependencyObjectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE.Helpers,ImageSourceAnimator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Helpers\ImageSourceAnimator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE.Settings,ImageStretchConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Settings\Setting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClaudiaIDE.Settings,PositionConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Settings\Setting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ClaudiaIDE.Settings,Setting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buchizo_ClaudiaIDE\ClaudiaIDE\Settings\Setting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OnChanged
