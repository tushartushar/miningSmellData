Unnecessary Abstraction,MSTestExtensions,Assertion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bbraithwaite_MSTestExtensions\src\MSTestExtensions\Assertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MSTestExtensions,ThrowsAsyncAssert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bbraithwaite_MSTestExtensions\src\MSTestExtensions\ThrowsAsyncAssert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Insufficient Modularization,MSTestExtensions,MsTestAssertions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bbraithwaite_MSTestExtensions\src\MSTestExtensions\MsTestAssertions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
