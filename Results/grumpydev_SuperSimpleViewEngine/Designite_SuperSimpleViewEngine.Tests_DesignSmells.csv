Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests,FakeUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_SuperSimpleViewEngine\SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests\FakeViewEngineHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Username
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests,SuperSimpleViewEngineTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_SuperSimpleViewEngine\SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests\SuperSimpleViewEngineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests,SuperSimpleViewEngineTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_SuperSimpleViewEngine\SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests\SuperSimpleViewEngineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 83 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests,SuperSimpleViewEngineTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_SuperSimpleViewEngine\SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests\SuperSimpleViewEngineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 83 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests,FakeViewEngineHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_SuperSimpleViewEngine\SuperSimpleViewEngine.Tests\FakeViewEngineHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetUriString
