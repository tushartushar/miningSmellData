Unutilized Abstraction,QuickGraph.Data,DataSetGraphExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\YaccConstructor_QuickGraph\src\QuickGraph.Data\DataSetGraphExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,D:\newReposJune17\YaccConstructor_QuickGraph\src\QuickGraph.Data\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' InformationalVersion
