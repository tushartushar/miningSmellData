Unutilized Abstraction,Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests,RaygunClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests\RaygunClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests,RaygunClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests\RaygunClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandlerIsChecked which is more interested in members of the type: FakeRaygunClient

Insufficient Modularization,Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests,RaygunClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests\RaygunClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests,FakeRaygunClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net.Xamarin.Mac.Tests\Model\FakeRaygunClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mindscape.Raygun4Net.RaygunClient
