Imperative Abstraction,Mindscape.Raygun4Net,HttpApplicationInitializer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net\ProfilingSupport\HttpApplicationInitializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialize
Unutilized Abstraction,Mindscape.Raygun4Net,RaygunHttpModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net\RaygunHttpModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mindscape.Raygun4Net.ProfilingSupport,ISamplingOverride,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net\ProfilingSupport\ISamplingOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Policy
Imperative Abstraction,Mindscape.Raygun4Net.ProfilingSupport,SettingsManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net\ProfilingSupport\SettingsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ParseSamplingSettings
Insufficient Modularization,Mindscape.Raygun4Net,RaygunClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net4\RaygunClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mindscape.Raygun4Net,RaygunClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net4\RaygunClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
