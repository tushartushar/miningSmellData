(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Mindscape.Raygun4Net4.Tests,RaygunClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindscapeHQ_raygun4net\Mindscape.Raygun4Net4.Tests\RaygunClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StripReflectionTypeLoadException which is more interested in members of the type: FakeRaygunClient
