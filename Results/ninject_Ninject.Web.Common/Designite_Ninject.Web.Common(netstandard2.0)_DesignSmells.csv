Unutilized Abstraction,Ninject.Web.Common,RequestScopeExtensionMethod,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ninject_Ninject.Web.Common\src\Ninject.Web.Common\RequestScopeExtensionMethod.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
