The participating types that were checked are: CustomPropertyDescriptor' StandardValueAttribute (in method "ConvertFrom" of class "StandardValuesConverter").

Cyclic Hierarchy,CNCMaps.Shared,Option,C:\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Shared\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Category
Rebellious Hierarchy,CNCMaps.Shared,Category,C:\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Shared\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnParseComplete
