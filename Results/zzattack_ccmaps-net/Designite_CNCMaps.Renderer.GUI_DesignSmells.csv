Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CNCMaps.GUI,CustomSettingsProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\CustomSettingsProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CNCMaps.GUI,SettingStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\CustomSettingsProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name' serializeAs' value
Imperative Abstraction,CNCMaps.GUI,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FindMixDir
Unnecessary Abstraction,CNCMaps.GUI,UpdateAvailableArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\UpdateChecker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Version' ReleaseNotes' ReleaseDate' DownloadUrl
Insufficient Modularization,CNCMaps.GUI,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,CNCMaps.GUI,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 119
Broken Modularization,CNCMaps.GUI.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Renderer.GUI\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' input' mixdir' output' outputjpg' outputjpgq' outputpng' outputpngq' customfilename' engineauto' enginets' enginefs' enginera2' engineyr' modconfig' modconfigfile' emphore' squaredpos' tiledpos' autosize' localsize' fullsize' injectthumb' hwvoxels' swvoxels' renderprog' outputauto' outputcustom' omitsquarespreview' outputthumb' thumbdimensions' thumbpreserveaspect' email' markers' fixuptiles' defaultInstance
