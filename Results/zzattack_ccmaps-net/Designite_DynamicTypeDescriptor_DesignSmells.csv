Unnecessary Abstraction,CNCMaps.Shared.DynamicTypeDescription,IResourceAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Shared\DynamicTypeDescription\DynamicTypeDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BaseName' KeyPrefix' AssemblyFullName
Unutilized Abstraction,CNCMaps.Shared.DynamicTypeDescription,StandardValueEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Shared\DynamicTypeDescription\DynamicTypeDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Missing Hierarchy,CNCMaps.Shared.DynamicTypeDescription,StandardValuesConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\zzattack_ccmaps-net\CNCMaps.Shared\DynamicTypeDescription\DynamicTypeDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CustomPropertyDescriptor' StandardValueAttribute (in method "ConvertFrom" of class "StandardValuesConverter").
