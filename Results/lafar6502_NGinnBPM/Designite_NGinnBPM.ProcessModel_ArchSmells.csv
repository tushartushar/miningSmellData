Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: NGinnBPM.ProcessModel' NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.Data,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.FlowDef' NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.Data.EnumDef
Unstable Dependency,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.Data,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NGinnBPM.ProcessModel,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.Data.XmlSchemaUtil
Feature Concentration,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AtomicTaskDef' NGinnTaskType' TaskDef' CompositeTaskDef' TaskOutPortType' FlowDef' IHaveMetadata' NodeDef' PlaceDef' PlaceTypes' ProcessDef' DataBindingDef' IValidate' PackageDef]' [DataBindingType]' [TaskSplitType]' [TaskInPortType]' [KeyValue]' [XmlSchemaUtil]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.32,NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.TaskInPortType' NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.KeyValue' NGinnBPM.ProcessModel.XmlSchemaUtil
