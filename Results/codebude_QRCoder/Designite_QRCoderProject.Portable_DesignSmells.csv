Unutilized Abstraction,QRCoder,PngByteQRCodeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\PngByteQRCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,QRCoder,AlignmentPattern,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\QRCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' PatternPositions
Deficient Encapsulation,QRCoder,AlignmentPattern,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\QRCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Version' PatternPositions
Insufficient Modularization,QRCoder,QRCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\QRCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,QRCoder,QRCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\QRCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 120
Broken Hierarchy,QRCoder,AsciiQRCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\AsciiQRCode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): QRCoder.AbstractQRCode
Broken Hierarchy,QRCoder,BitmapByteQRCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\BitmapByteQRCode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): QRCoder.AbstractQRCode
Wide Hierarchy,QRCoder,Payload,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\PayloadGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: QRCoder.WiFi' QRCoder.Mail' QRCoder.SMS' QRCoder.MMS' QRCoder.Geolocation' QRCoder.PhoneNumber' QRCoder.SkypeCall' QRCoder.Url' QRCoder.WhatsAppMessage' QRCoder.Bookmark' QRCoder.ContactData' QRCoder.BitcoinAddress' QRCoder.SwissQrCode' QRCoder.Girocode' QRCoder.BezahlCode' QRCoder.CalendarEvent' QRCoder.OneTimePassword' QRCoder.ShadowSocksConfig' QRCoder.MoneroTransaction' QRCoder.SlovenianUpnQr
Rebellious Hierarchy,QRCoder,Payload,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\PayloadGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Broken Hierarchy,QRCoder,PngByteQRCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codebude_QRCoder\QRCoder\PngByteQRCode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): QRCoder.AbstractQRCode
