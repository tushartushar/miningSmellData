Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Intellisense.Helper,ShareInfo1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Helper\NetworkShareInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NetName' ShareType
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Intellisense.Provider,ProviderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Provider\ProviderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Dev2.Studio.InterfaceImplementors,CalculateIntellisenseProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Provider\CalculateIntellisenseProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetIntellisenseResults which is more interested in members of the type: ISyntaxTreeBuilderHelper
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Studio.InterfaceImplementors,CalculateIntellisenseTextConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Provider\CalculateIntellisenseProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Dev2.Intellisense.Helper,ShareInfo2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Helper\NetworkShareInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Permissions' MaxUsers' CurrentUsers
Broken Modularization,Dev2.Intellisense.Helper,ShareInfo2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Helper\NetworkShareInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NetName' ShareType' Remark' Permissions' MaxUsers' CurrentUsers' Path' Password
Insufficient Modularization,Dev2.UI,IntellisenseTextBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\IntellisenseTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dev2.UI,IntellisenseTextBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\IntellisenseTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 111
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Intellisense.Helper,ShareCollectionFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Helper\IShareCollectionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateShareCollection
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Intellisense.Helper,Share,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Intellisense\Helper\NetworkShareInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
