Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Storage,FsInteropFunctions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\FSInteropFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Storage,ScopedEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\ScopedEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Storage,WarewolfListIterator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\WarewolfListIterator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,ExecutionEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\ExecutionEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 56 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,ExecutionEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\ExecutionEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 61 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,ExecutionEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\ExecutionEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 114
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,ScopedEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\ScopedEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,ScopedEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\ScopedEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,WarewolfListIterator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\WarewolfListIterator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,WarewolfListIterator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\WarewolfListIterator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Warewolf.Storage,BuildJObjectArrayIndexMapHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\BuildJObjectArrayIndexMapHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Warewolf.Storage.BuildJObjectArrayIndexMapHelper' Warewolf.Storage.ExecutionEnvironment
Rebellious Hierarchy,Warewolf.Storage,WarewolfAtomIterator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\WarewolfAtomIterator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetLength' HasMoreData
Rebellious Hierarchy,Warewolf.Storage,WarewolfListIterator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Storage\WarewolfListIterator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetMax' HasMoreData
