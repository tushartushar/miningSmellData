Unnecessary Abstraction,QueueWorker,IArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TriggerId' ShowConsole' ServerEndpoint
Unnecessary Abstraction,QueueWorker,Args,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TriggerId' ShowConsole' ServerEndpoint' _serverEndpoint
Feature Envy,QueueWorker,LoggingConsumerWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\LoggingConsumerWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Consume which is more interested in members of the type: IExecutionLogPublisher
Feature Envy,QueueWorker,QueueWorkerImplementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Run which is more interested in members of the type: IWorkerContext
Feature Envy,QueueWorker,DeadLetterPublisher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Publish which is more interested in members of the type: IWorkerContext
Imperative Abstraction,QueueWorker,WorkerContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\WorkerContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: WatchTriggerResource
Rebellious Hierarchy,QueueWorker,ExecutionLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.QueueWorker\ExecutionLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StartExecution
