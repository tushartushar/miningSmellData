Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Diagnostics.Debug,DebugDispatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance' _instance' _lock
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Diagnostics.Debug,DebugDispatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Diagnostics.Debug,DebugMessageRepo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugMessageRepo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Multifaceted Abstraction,Dev2.Diagnostics.Debug,DebugState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Diagnostics,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Common,CharacterMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Logging\EnvironmentVariables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DefaultEncoding' LettersStartNumber' LettersLength
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Common,CharacterMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Logging\EnvironmentVariables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Diagnostics.Debug,DebugState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: IsFinalStep' IsFirstStep
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Diagnostics,DebugItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Contains' Add' FetchResultsList
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Diagnostics,DebugItemResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Diagnostics\Debug\DebugItemResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetMoreLinkItem
