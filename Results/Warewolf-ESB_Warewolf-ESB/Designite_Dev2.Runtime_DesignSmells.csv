Feature Envy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,Evaluator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\Evaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CloneResource which is more interested in members of the type: IBuilderSerializer
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,TestExecutionContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\Evaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _test' _wfappUtils' _invokeErrors' _serializer

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer.cs' [139' 158])' RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer.cs' [207' 226])
Feature Envy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,WfExecutionContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\WfExecutionContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddExecutionToExecutionManager which is more interested in members of the type: IExecutionManager
Feature Envy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Control,EnvironmentOutputMappingManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Control\EnvironmentOutputMappingManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OutputsToEnvironment which is more interested in members of the type: IDataListFactory

The method causing this smell is: Execute which is more interested in members of the type: IDSFDataObject
Feature Envy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Control,SubExecutionHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Control\EsbServicesEndpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConfigureDataListIfRemote which is more interested in members of the type: IDSFDataObject
Feature Envy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Control,SubExecutionHelperAsync,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Control\EsbServicesEndpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DoRemoteDataObjectConfiguration which is more interested in members of the type: IDSFDataObject
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Control,IdsfDataObjectExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Control\EsbServicesEndpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,TestExecutionContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\Evaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _test' _wfappUtils' _invokeErrors' _serializer
Deficient Encapsulation,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,UpdateFailureMessageArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\Evaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _pendingTestSteps' _invalidTestSteps' _failingTestSteps' _pendingTestOutputs' _invalidTestOutputs' _failingTestOutputs
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,DatabaseServiceContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\DatabaseServiceContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
