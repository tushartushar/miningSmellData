Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Control,EnvironmentOutputMappingManager,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Control\EnvironmentOutputMappingManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdatePreviousEnvironmentWithSubExecutionResultUsingOutputMappings
Duplicate Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer (C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer.cs' [141' 160])' RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer (C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\RemoteWorkflowExecutionContainer.cs' [212' 231])
Insufficient Modularization,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,ServiceTestExecutionContainer,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\ServiceTestExecutionContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dev2.Runtime.ESB.Execution,DatabaseServiceContainer,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime\ESB\Execution\DatabaseServiceContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CanExecute' Execute
