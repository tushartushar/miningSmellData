Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration.ComponentModel,DataListVariable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\ComponentModel\DataListVariable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' _name
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration.ComponentModel,DataListVariable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\ComponentModel\DataListVariable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unnecessary Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration,IConfigurationAssemblyMarker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\IAssemblyMarker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration,IConfigurationAssemblyMarker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\IAssemblyMarker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration.Settings,Configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\Settings\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration.ViewModels.Base,DelegateCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\ViewModels\Base\DelegateCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dev2.Runtime.Configuration.ViewModels.Base,RelayCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\ViewModels\Base\RelayCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,AutoCompleteBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\CustomControls\AutoCompleteBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 67 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,AutoCompleteBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\CustomControls\AutoCompleteBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 161
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,AutoCompleteBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\CustomControls\AutoCompleteBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Windows.Controls.AutoCompleteBox' System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutoCompleteBoxAutomationPeer
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows.Controls,AutoCompleteBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\CustomControls\AutoCompleteBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnCreateAutomationPeer
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows.Controls,SelectorSelectionAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\CustomControls\SelectorSelectionAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateAutomationPeer
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows.Automation.Peers,AutoCompleteBoxAutomationPeer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Dev2.Runtime.Configuration\CustomControls\AutoCompleteBoxAutomationPeer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetAutomationControlTypeCore' GetClassNameCore
