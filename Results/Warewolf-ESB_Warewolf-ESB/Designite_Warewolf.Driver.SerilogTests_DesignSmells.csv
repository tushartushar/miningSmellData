Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog.Tests,GetLogDataServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\GetLogDataServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog.Tests,SeriLogPublishTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogPublishTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog.Tests,TestSeriLogSQLiteConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogPublishTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateLogger which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Tests,SeriLogConnectionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogConnectionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Tests,SeriLogConsumerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogConsumerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Warewolf.Tests,SeriLogConsumerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogConsumerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SeriLogConsumerTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogConsumerTests.cs' [32' 57])' SeriLogConsumerTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogConsumerTests.cs' [65' 90])
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Tests.Sinks,SQLiteConfigTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\Sinks\SQLiteConfigTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Warewolf.Tests,AuditStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.SerilogTests\SeriLogConsumerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AdditionalDetail' AuditDate' AuditType' Environment' Exception' ExecutingUser' ExecutionID' ExecutionOrigin' ExecutionOriginDescription' ExecutionToken' Id' IsRemoteWorkflow' IsSubExecution' NextActivity' NextActivityId' NextActivityType' ParentID' PreviousActivity' PreviousActivityId' PreviousActivityType' ServerID' VersionNumber' WorkflowID' WorkflowName
