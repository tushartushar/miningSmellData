Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Security.Specs,SettingsPermissionsFeature,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Security.Specs\Settings Permissions.feature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 145 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Security.Specs,SettingsPermissionsFeature,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Security.Specs\Settings Permissions.feature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 145 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Warewolf.Security.Specs,SettingsPermissionsFeature,C:\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Security.Specs\Settings Permissions.feature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 154
