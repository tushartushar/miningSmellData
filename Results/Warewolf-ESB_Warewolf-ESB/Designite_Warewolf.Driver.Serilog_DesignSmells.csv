Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog,ISeriLogConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.Serilog\ISeriLogConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Logger' ConnectionString
Feature Envy,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog,SeriLogConsumer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.Serilog\SeriLogConsumer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LogMessage which is more interested in members of the type: ILoggerPublisher
Unnecessary Abstraction,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog,SeriLogData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.Serilog\SeriLogData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Timestamp' Message' NewLine' Exception' Level
Unutilized Abstraction,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog,SeriLogData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.Serilog\SeriLogData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog,SeriLogSQLiteConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.Serilog\Sinks\SQLiteConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateLogger which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
Broken Modularization,Warewolf.Driver.Serilog,SeriLogData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Warewolf-ESB_Warewolf-ESB\Dev\Warewolf.Driver.Serilog\SeriLogData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Timestamp' Message' NewLine' Exception' Level
