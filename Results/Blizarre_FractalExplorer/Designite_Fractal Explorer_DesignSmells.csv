Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,TP_CS,MainInterface,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\MainInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: moveView
Multifaceted Abstraction,TP_CS,MainInterface,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\MainInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Unnecessary Abstraction,TP_CS,ImageNotReadyException,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TP_CS,ImageNotReadyException,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TP_CS,ImageNotReadyException,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ImageNotReadyException[114' 148]' ImageNotReadyException[170' 204]
Unnecessary Abstraction,TP_CS.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,TP_CS,Complex,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\Complex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _real' _imag
Deficient Encapsulation,TP_CS,FractalParameters,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: type' c' viewPort' width' height' highQuality
Deficient Encapsulation,TP_CS,RenderingParameters,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: contrast' brightness' RedParam' GreenParam' BlueParam' RedExp' GreenExp' BlueExp
Broken Modularization,TP_CS,FractalParameters,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' type' c' viewPort' width' height' highQuality
Broken Modularization,TP_CS,RenderingParameters,C:\repos\Blizarre_FractalExplorer\Fractal Explorer\FractalGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' contrast' brightness' RedParam' GreenParam' BlueParam' RedExp' GreenExp' BlueExp
