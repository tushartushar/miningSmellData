Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ZeoScope,AlarmState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\SoundAlarm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Count' SleepStage
Imperative Abstraction,ZeoScope,ScopePanel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\ScopePanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RenderDevice
Unutilized Abstraction,ZeoScope,ScopePanel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\ScopePanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ZeoScope,FTDeviceInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\Ftdi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Flags' Type' ID' LocId' SerialNumber' Description
Deficient Encapsulation,ZeoScope,FTDeviceInfoNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\Ftdi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Flags' Type' ID' LocId' SerialNumber' Description' FTHandle
Deficient Encapsulation,ZeoScope,VectorColored,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\ScopePanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Color
Broken Modularization,ZeoScope,FTDeviceInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\Ftdi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Flags' Type' ID' LocId' SerialNumber' Description
Broken Modularization,ZeoScope,FTDeviceInfoNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\Ftdi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Flags' Type' ID' LocId' SerialNumber' Description' FTHandle
Insufficient Modularization,ZeoScope,MainScreen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\MainScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Broken Modularization,ZeoScope,ZeoSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\ZeoSettings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' AlarmEnabled' ComPortSelectedIndex' MP3FileName' AlarmCue' AlarmFromTime' AlarmToTime' EegLevelSelecteIndex' FileNames' WindowMaximized' WindowHeight' WindowWidth' FreqPanelHeight' AlarmFadeIn' AlarmFadeOut' AlarmDuration' AlarmCues' AlarmSnooze' MaxVolume' LicenseAgree' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,ZeoScope,ZeoStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dancodru_ZeoScope\src\ZeoScopeApp\ZeoStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
