Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,FeatureSwitcher(netstandard1.0),FeatureSwitcher.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: FeatureSwitcher.Configuration' FeatureSwitcher,FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.Builder' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration,FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.Builder' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration
Unstable Dependency,FeatureSwitcher(netstandard1.0),FeatureSwitcher,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): FeatureSwitcher.Configuration,FeatureSwitcher.Features' FeatureSwitcher.OfAnyType,FeatureSwitcher.Features' FeatureSwitcher.OfAnyType
Feature Concentration,FeatureSwitcher(netstandard1.0),FeatureSwitcher.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Builder' Features' OfAnyType' IConfigureBehavior' IConfigureFeatures' IConfigureNaming]' [OfType<T>]' [InMemory]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.OfType<T>' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.InMemory,FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.Builder' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.Features' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.OfAnyType' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.OfType<T>' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.IConfigureBehavior' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.IConfigureFeatures' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.IConfigureNaming' FeatureSwitcher.Configuration.InMemory
