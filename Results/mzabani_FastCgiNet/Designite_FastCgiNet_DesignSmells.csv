Broken Hierarchy,FastCgiNet,StdinRecord,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Records\StdinRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StreamRecordBase
Broken Hierarchy,FastCgiNet,StdoutRecord,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Records\StdoutRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StreamRecordBase
Broken Hierarchy,FastCgiNet,StderrRecord,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Records\StderrRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StreamRecordBase
Broken Hierarchy,FastCgiNet,ParamsRecord,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Records\ParamsRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StreamRecordBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,FastCgiNet,AbortRequestRecord,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Records\AbortRequestRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FeedBytes
Broken Hierarchy,FastCgiNet,DataRecord,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Records\DataRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StreamRecordBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,FastCgiNet.Streams,RecordContentsStream,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Streams\RecordContentsStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' SetLength
Rebellious Hierarchy,FastCgiNet.Streams,FastCgiStream,D:\newReposJune17\mzabani_FastCgiNet\FastCgiNet\Streams\FastCgiStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
