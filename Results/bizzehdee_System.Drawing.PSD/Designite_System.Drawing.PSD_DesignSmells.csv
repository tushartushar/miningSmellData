Duplicate Abstraction,System.Drawing.PSD,AlphaChannels,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\AlphaChannels.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AlphaChannels[1' 28]' BinaryReverseReader[1' 28]' BinaryReverseWriter[1' 28]' ImageDecoder[1' 28]' ResourceIDs[1' 28]' LengthWriter[1' 28]' ResolutionInfo[1' 28]' RleHelper[1' 28]' Thumbnail[1' 28]' Utilities[1' 28]' Layer[1' 28]' PsdFile[1' 28]

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AlphaChannels[1' 29]' Layer[1' 29]' PsdFile[1' 29]
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Drawing.PSD,BinaryReverseReader,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\BinaryReverseReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BinaryReverseReader[1' 33]' BinaryReverseWriter[1' 33]' ResolutionInfo[1' 33]' Thumbnail[1' 33]
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Drawing.PSD,BinaryReverseReader,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\BinaryReverseReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BinaryReverseReader[1' 32]' ResourceIDs[1' 32]' RleHelper[1' 32]' BinaryReverseWriter[1' 32]' ResolutionInfo[1' 32]' Thumbnail[1' 32]
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Drawing.PSD,ImageDecoder,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\ImageDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Drawing.PSD,LengthWriter,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\LengthWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: LengthWriter[1' 30]' Utilities[1' 30]
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Drawing.PSD,PsdFile,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\PSDFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ColorModeData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Drawing.PSD,Layer,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\Layer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Layer' PsdFile
Broken Hierarchy,System.Drawing.PSD,Thumbnail,C:\repos\bizzehdee_System.Drawing.PSD\Thumbnail.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ImageResource
