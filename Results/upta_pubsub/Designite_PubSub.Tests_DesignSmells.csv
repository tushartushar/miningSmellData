Unutilized Abstraction,PubSub.Tests,CoreHubTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\upta_pubsub\PubSub.Tests\CoreHubTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PubSub.Tests,CoreHubTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\upta_pubsub\PubSub.Tests\CoreHubTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Publish_CallsAllRegisteredActions which is more interested in members of the type: Hub

Unnecessary Abstraction,PubSub.Tests,Event,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\upta_pubsub\PubSub.Tests\CoreHubTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
