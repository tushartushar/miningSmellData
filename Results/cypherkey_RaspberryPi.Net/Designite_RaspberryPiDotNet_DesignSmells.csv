Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RaspberryPiDotNet,DS1620,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\DS1620.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RaspberryPiDotNet,MCP3008,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\MCP3008.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RaspberryPiDotNet.MicroLiquidCrystal,Lcd,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\MicroLiquidCrystal\Lcd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RaspberryPiDotNet.TM16XX,TM1638,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\TM16XX\TM1638.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RaspberryPiDotNet.TM16XX,TM16XX,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\TM16XX\TM16XX.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,RaspberryPiDotNet,GPIO,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\GPIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _resistor
Cyclic Hierarchy,RaspberryPiDotNet,GPIO,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\GPIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GPIODebug
Cyclic Hierarchy,RaspberryPiDotNet,GPIO,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\GPIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GPIOFile
Cyclic Hierarchy,RaspberryPiDotNet,GPIO,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\GPIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GPIOMem
Unfactored Hierarchy,RaspberryPiDotNet.MicroLiquidCrystal,RaspPiGPIOFileLcdTransferProvider,F:\newReposMay17\cypherkey_RaspberryPi.Net\RaspberryPiDotNet\MicroLiquidCrystal\RaspPiGPIOFileLcdTransferProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: RaspPiGPIOFileLcdTransferProvider[84' 164]' RaspPiGPIOMemLcdTransferProvider[84' 164]
