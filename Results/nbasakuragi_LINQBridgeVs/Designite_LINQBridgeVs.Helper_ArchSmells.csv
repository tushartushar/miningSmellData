Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: LINQBridgeVs.Helper' LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Configuration,LINQBridgeVs.Helper.BridgeTrigger' LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Configuration.PackageConfigurator
Unstable Dependency,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): LINQBridgeVs.Helper,LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Configuration.Locations' LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Configuration.Resources
Ambiguous Interface,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: BridgeTrigger,LINQBridgeVs.Helper.BridgeTrigger
Feature Concentration,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,LINQBridgeVs.Helper,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BridgeTrigger' ExecuteParams' CommandAction]' [CommandStates]' [Locations]' [Resources]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67,LINQBridgeVs.Helper.CommandStates' LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Locations' LINQBridgeVs.Helper.Resources
