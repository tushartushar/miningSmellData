Unnecessary Abstraction,BridgeVs.UnitTest.Model,AnotherModelTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbasakuragi_LINQBridgeVs\Test\BridgeVs.UnitTest.Model\AnotherModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,BridgeVs.UnitTest.Model,AnotherModelTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbasakuragi_LINQBridgeVs\Test\BridgeVs.UnitTest.Model\AnotherModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AnotherModelTest (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbasakuragi_LINQBridgeVs\Test\BridgeVs.UnitTest.Model\AnotherModel.cs' [1' 26])' CustomType1 (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nbasakuragi_LINQBridgeVs\Test\BridgeVs.UnitTest.Model\Models.cs' [1' 26])
