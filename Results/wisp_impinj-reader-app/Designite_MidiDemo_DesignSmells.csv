Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MIDI_Control_Demo,Midi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MidiDemo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MIDI_Control_Demo,Midi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MidiDemo.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DisposeMidiConfig which is more interested in members of the type: MIDI_control
Unnecessary Abstraction,MIDI_Control_Demo,NoteInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' instr' val' vol' pitch' mod
Deficient Encapsulation,MIDI_Control_Demo,NoteInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: instr' val' vol' pitch' mod
Broken Modularization,MIDI_Control_Demo,NoteInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' instr' val' vol' pitch' mod
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MIDI_Control_Demo,MIDI_control,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MIDI_Control_Demo.MIDI_control' MIDI_Control_Demo.XY_panel
