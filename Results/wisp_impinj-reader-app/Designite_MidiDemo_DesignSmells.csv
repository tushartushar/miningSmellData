Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MIDI_Control_Demo,NoteInfo,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' instr' val' vol' pitch' mod
Deficient Encapsulation,MIDI_Control_Demo,NoteInfo,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: instr' val' vol' pitch' mod
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MIDI_Control_Demo,MIDI_control,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MIDI_Control_Demo.MIDI_control' MIDI_Control_Demo.XY_panel
Broken Modularization,MIDI_Control_Demo,NoteInfo,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\MIDI_control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' instr' val' vol' pitch' mod
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MIDI_Control_Demo,XY_panel,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\MidiDemo\XY_panel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MIDI_Control_Demo.XY_panel' MIDI_Control_Demo.MIDI_control
