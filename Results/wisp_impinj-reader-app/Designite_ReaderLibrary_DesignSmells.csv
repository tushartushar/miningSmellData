Duplicate Abstraction,ReaderLibrary,TagType,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\MyTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TagType (C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\MyTag.cs' [2' 34])' RFIDReader (C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\RFIDReader.cs' [1' 33])
Unutilized Abstraction,ReaderLibrary,SettingsForm,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\SettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReaderLibrary.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,MyTag,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\MyTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: socFilteredValue' socFilteredTemperature
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,ReaderManager,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: readerModes' readerconfig
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,ReaderConfig,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: attenuation' modeIndex' tagPopulation' tagTransitTime' antennaID' readerSensitivity' channelIndex' hopTableIndex' periodicTriggerValue
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,InventoryConfig,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: startTrigger' stopTrigger' AITriggerType' duration' numAttempts' numTags' reportTrigger' reportN' AITimeout
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,ReadCmdSettings,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tagID' mask' wordPtr' wordCount
Insufficient Modularization,ReaderLibrary,MyTag,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\MyTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ReaderLibrary,ReaderManager,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReaderLibrary,ReaderManager,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReaderLibrary.ReaderManager' ReaderLibrary.RFIDReader
Broken Modularization,ReaderLibrary,ReaderConfig,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' attenuation' modeIndex' tagPopulation' tagTransitTime' antennaID' readerSensitivity' channelIndex' hopTableIndex' periodicTriggerValue
Broken Modularization,ReaderLibrary,InventoryConfig,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' startTrigger' stopTrigger' AITriggerType' duration' numAttempts' numTags' reportTrigger' reportN' AITimeout
Insufficient Modularization,ReaderLibrary,RFIDReader,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\RFIDReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReaderLibrary,RFIDReader,C:\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\RFIDReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReaderLibrary.RFIDReader' ReaderLibrary.ReaderManager
