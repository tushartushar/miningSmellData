Feature Envy,ReaderLibrary,RFIDReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\RFIDReader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CleanSubscriptionClient which is more interested in members of the type: LLRPClient
Unutilized Abstraction,ReaderLibrary,SettingsForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\SettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReaderLibrary.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,MyTag,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\MyTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: socFilteredValue' socFilteredTemperature
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,ReaderManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: readerModes' readerconfig
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,ReaderConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: attenuation' modeIndex' tagPopulation' tagTransitTime' antennaID' readerSensitivity' channelIndex' hopTableIndex' periodicTriggerValue
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,InventoryConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: startTrigger' stopTrigger' AITriggerType' duration' numAttempts' numTags' reportTrigger' reportN' AITimeout
Deficient Encapsulation,ReaderLibrary,ReadCmdSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tagID' mask' wordPtr' wordCount
Insufficient Modularization,ReaderLibrary,MyTag,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\MyTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ReaderLibrary,ReaderManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Broken Modularization,ReaderLibrary,ReaderConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' attenuation' modeIndex' tagPopulation' tagTransitTime' antennaID' readerSensitivity' channelIndex' hopTableIndex' periodicTriggerValue
Broken Modularization,ReaderLibrary,InventoryConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' startTrigger' stopTrigger' AITriggerType' duration' numAttempts' numTags' reportTrigger' reportN' AITimeout
Insufficient Modularization,ReaderLibrary,RFIDReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\RFIDReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReaderLibrary,ReaderManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wisp_impinj-reader-app\ReaderLibrary\ReaderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReaderLibrary.ReaderManager' ReaderLibrary.RFIDReader
