Unnecessary Abstraction,WISPDemo.Properties,Settings,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,WISPDemo,WispHandleTags,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\HandleTags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: xMax' xMin' yMax' yMin' zMax' zMin' currentX' currentY' currentZ' deltaX' deltaY' deltaZ' temperatureCelsius' temperatureSource' temperatureData' temperatureDataCount' hasNewTempData' binkBonkCallback' newTags' tagCount
Deficient Encapsulation,WISPDemo,MainFrm,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\MainFrm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: accelInfo
Insufficient Modularization,WISPDemo,WispHandleTags,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\HandleTags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WISPDemo,WispHandleTags,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\HandleTags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WISPDemo,WispHandleTags,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\HandleTags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WispHandleTags' MainFrm
Insufficient Modularization,WISPDemo,MainFrm,D:\newReposJune17\wisp_impinj-reader-app\WISPDemo\MainFrm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
