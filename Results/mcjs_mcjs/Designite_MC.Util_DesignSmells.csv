Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,m.Util,ISourceLocation,C:\repos\mcjs_mcjs\MC.Util\ISourceLocation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Function' Offset' Line' Character' Prettified
Unutilized Abstraction,m.Util,TimeCounter,C:\repos\mcjs_mcjs\MC.Util\TimeCounter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,m.Util,Timers,C:\repos\mcjs_mcjs\MC.Util\Timers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.8
Deficient Encapsulation,m.Util,Timers,C:\repos\mcjs_mcjs\MC.Util\Timers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TimersOverhead
Deficient Encapsulation,m.Util,Timers,C:\repos\mcjs_mcjs\MC.Util\Timers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TimersOverhead
Broken Modularization,m.Util,ISourceLocation,C:\repos\mcjs_mcjs\MC.Util\ISourceLocation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Function' Offset' Line' Character' Prettified
