Unnecessary Abstraction,ConnectedLivingSpace,IModuleDockingHatch,D:\newReposJune17\codepoetpbowden_ConnectedLivingSpace\plugins\CLSInterfaces\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HatchOpen' HatchStatus' IsDocked' ModDockNode' HatchEvents
Unutilized Abstraction,ConnectedLivingSpace,IModuleDockingHatch,D:\newReposJune17\codepoetpbowden_ConnectedLivingSpace\plugins\CLSInterfaces\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
