Unutilized Abstraction,CypherNet.IntegrationTests,IntegrationTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mtranter_CypherNet\CypherNet.IntegrationTests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CypherNet.IntegrationTests,TestNodeType,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mtranter_CypherNet\CypherNet.IntegrationTests\TestNodeType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Age' Name' Reference
Insufficient Modularization,CypherNet.IntegrationTests,IntegrationTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mtranter_CypherNet\CypherNet.IntegrationTests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
