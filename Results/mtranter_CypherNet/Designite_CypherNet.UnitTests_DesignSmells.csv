Unnecessary Abstraction,Dynamic4Neo.Tests,TestCypherClause,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mtranter_CypherNet\CypherNet.UnitTests\TestCypherClause.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: actor' director' movie' directedBy' actedIn
Broken Modularization,Dynamic4Neo.Tests,TestCypherClause,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mtranter_CypherNet\CypherNet.UnitTests\TestCypherClause.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
