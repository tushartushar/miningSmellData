Unutilized Abstraction,Test.Parseq,CombinatorTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinator.Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Test.Parseq,CombinatorTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinator.Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CombinatorTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinator.Test.cs' [1' 28])' CharsTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinators\Chars.Test.cs' [1' 28])' PrimsTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinators\Prims.Test.cs' [1' 28])

Insufficient Modularization,Test.Parseq,CombinatorTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinator.Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Test.Parseq,CombinatorTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\linerlock_parseq\Test\Combinator.Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
