Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Eto.Test.Wpf.UnitTests,NativeParentWindowTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\NativeParentWindowTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NativeParentWindowTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\NativeParentWindowTests.cs' [91' 116])' NativeParentWindowTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\NativeParentWindowTests.cs' [165' 190])
Unutilized Abstraction,Eto.Test.Wpf.UnitTests,ScreenTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\ScreenTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eto.Test.Wpf.UnitTests,TestScreen,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\ScreenTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Bounds' LogicalSize' LogicalPixelSize
Unutilized Abstraction,Eto.Test.Wpf.UnitTests,TransformStackTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\TransformStackTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Eto.Test.Wpf.UnitTests,TestLogicalScreenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.Wpf\UnitTests\ScreenTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetBounds' GetLogicalPixelSize' GetLogicalSize
