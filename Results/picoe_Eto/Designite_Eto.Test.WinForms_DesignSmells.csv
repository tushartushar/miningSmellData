Unutilized Abstraction,Eto.Test.WinForms.UnitTests,NativeTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\test\Eto.Test.WinForms\UnitTests\NativeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Eto,MouseLowLevelHook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eto,KeyboardLowLevelHook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' VirtualKeyCode' ScanCode' Flags' Time' ExtraInfo
Unutilized Abstraction,Eto,KeyboardLowLevelHook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Eto,RECT,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: left' top' right' bottom
Insufficient Modularization,Eto,Win32,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Eto,Win32,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Broken Modularization,Eto,RECT,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: width' height' left' top' right' bottom
Broken Modularization,Eto,MouseLowLevelHook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y' MouseData' Flags' Time' ExtraInfo
Broken Modularization,Eto,KeyboardLowLevelHook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.WinForms\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
