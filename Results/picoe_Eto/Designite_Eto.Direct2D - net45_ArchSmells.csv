Cyclic Dependency,Eto.Direct2D - net45,Eto.Direct2D,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Eto.Direct2D' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing,Eto.Direct2D.Conversions' Eto.Direct2D.Platform' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.IconFrameHandler' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.WicBitmapData' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.GraphicsHandler' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.FontHandler' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.GraphicsPathHandler
Unstable Dependency,Eto.Direct2D - net45,Eto.Direct2D,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Eto.Direct2D.Drawing' Eto.WinForms,Eto.Direct2D.ID2DBitmapHandler' Eto.Direct2D.MatrixHandler' Eto.Direct2D.PenData' Eto.Direct2D.BrushData' Eto.Direct2D.GraphicsPathHandler' Eto.Direct2D.SDFactory' Eto.Direct2D.Platform
Unstable Dependency,Eto.Direct2D - net45,Eto.Direct2D.Drawing,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Eto.WinForms.Forms.Controls,Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.DrawableHandler' Eto.Direct2D.Drawing.EtoDrawable
Scattered Functionality,Eto.Direct2D - net45,Eto.Direct2D.Drawing,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Eto.Direct2D' Eto.Drawing,Eto.Direct2D.Conversions' Eto.Drawing.Size' Eto.Drawing.Matrix
