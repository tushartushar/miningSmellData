Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Eto.Addin.Shared,Extensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Eto.Addin.Shared,ProjectWizardPageModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateCommon
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eto.Addin.Shared,TypeInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Text' UsePCL' UseSAL' UseNET
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eto.Addin.Shared,CombinedInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Text' Separate' IncludeXamMac
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eto.Addin.Shared,FormatInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Text' Mode
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eto.Addin.Shared,BaseInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Text' Base
Feature Envy,Eto.Addin.Shared,ProjectWizardPageView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProjectWizardPageView which is more interested in members of the type: Panel
Deficient Encapsulation,Eto.Addin.Shared,TypeInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Text' UsePCL' UseSAL' UseNET
Deficient Encapsulation,Eto.Addin.Shared,CombinedInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Text' Separate' IncludeXamMac
Deficient Encapsulation,Eto.Addin.Shared,FormatInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Text' Mode
Deficient Encapsulation,Eto.Addin.Shared,BaseInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ProjectWizardPageModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Text' Base
Broken Hierarchy,Eto.Addin.Shared,BaseDialog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\BaseDialog.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eto.Forms.Dialog
Broken Hierarchy,Eto.Addin.Shared,BasePageView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\BasePageView.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eto.Forms.Panel
Broken Hierarchy,Eto.Addin.Shared,ThemedColorsDialog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.Shared\ThemedColorsDialog.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eto.Forms.Dialog
