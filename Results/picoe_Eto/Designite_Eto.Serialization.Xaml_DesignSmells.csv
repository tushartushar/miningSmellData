Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Eto.Serialization.Xaml,EtoXamlSchemaContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.Serialization.Xaml\EtoXamlSchemaContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Eto.Serialization.Xaml.EtoXamlSchemaContext' Eto.Serialization.Xaml.EtoXamlType
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Eto.Serialization.Xaml,EtoXamlSchemaContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.Serialization.Xaml\EtoXamlSchemaContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Broken Hierarchy,Eto.Serialization.Xaml,DesignerUserControl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.Serialization.Xaml\DesignerUserControl.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eto.Forms.Panel
Rebellious Hierarchy,Eto.Serialization.Xaml,PropertiesXamlMember,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.Serialization.Xaml\EtoXamlSchemaContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LookupIsAmbient
Rebellious Hierarchy,Eto.Serialization.Xaml,EmptyConverter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Eto.Serialization.Xaml\EtoXamlType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CanConvertFrom' ConvertFrom
