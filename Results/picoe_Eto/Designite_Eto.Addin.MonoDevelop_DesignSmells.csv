Deficient Encapsulation,Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop,TagModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop\EnhancedFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OverrideTags
Broken Modularization,Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop,PlatformThemeHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop\PlatformThemeHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ProjectBackground' ProjectForeground' ProjectDialogBackground' ErrorForeground' SummaryBackground' SummaryForeground' DesignerBackground' DesignerPanel' AllColors
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop,ProjectWizard,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop\ProjectWizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop.ProjectWizard' Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop.ProjectWizardPage
Rebellious Hierarchy,Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop.Editor,EditorView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop\Editor\EditorView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnGetContents' Save' CanReuseView' DiscardChanges' GetDocumentObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop,ProjectWizard,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\picoe_Eto\src\Addins\Eto.Addin.MonoDevelop\ProjectWizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetPage
