Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Endava.DependencyGraph,DebugViewGraph,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\DebugView\DebugViewGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Duplicate Abstraction,Endava.DependencyGraph,DebugViewGraph,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\DebugView\DebugViewGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DebugViewGraph[417' 438]' DebugViewGraph[547' 568]
Deficient Encapsulation,Endava.DependencyGraph,DebugViewGraph,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\DebugView\DebugViewGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultShapeColor' InactiveShapeColor' KinematicShapeColor' SleepingShapeColor' StaticShapeColor
Insufficient Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph,DebugViewGraph,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\DebugView\DebugViewGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
