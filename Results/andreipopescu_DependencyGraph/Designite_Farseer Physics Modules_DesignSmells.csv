Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Endava.DependencyGraph,Game,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\Game.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,Endava.DependencyGraph,GameTime,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\GameTime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GameStartTime' FrameStartTime' ElapsedGameTime' TotalGameTime
Unutilized Abstraction,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,ScreenState,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,KeyboardState,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\KeyboardState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.

Deficient Encapsulation,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,MenuItem,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\MenuItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsExitItem' Screen
Deficient Encapsulation,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,ScreenManager,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\ScreenManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MainMenuScreen
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph,DrawableGameComponent,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\DrawableGameComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DrawableGameComponent' Game
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' MenuItem' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,MainMenuScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\MainMenuScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Rebellious Hierarchy,Endava.DependencyGraph.ScreenSystem,MenuScreen,C:\repos\andreipopescu_DependencyGraph\Physics Components\ScreenSystem\MenuScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
