Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Feature Concentration,Lucene.Net.Spatial,Lucene.Net.Spatial.Util,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DistanceToShapeValueSource]' [ShapeFieldCacheDistanceValueSource' ShapeFieldCacheProvider' ShapeFieldCache]' [CachingDoubleValueSource]' [ShapePredicateValueSource]' [ValueSourceFilter]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.71
Scattered Functionality,Lucene.Net.Spatial,Lucene.Net.Spatial.Prefix,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Lucene.Net.Spatial.Prefix.Tree' Lucene.Net.Spatial.Queries
