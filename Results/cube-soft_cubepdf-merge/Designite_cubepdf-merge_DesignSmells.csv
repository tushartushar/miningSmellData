Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,CubePDF,FileProperty,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\FileProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path' OwnerPassword' IgnoreExistence
Unnecessary Abstraction,CubePDF,Ret,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\Splitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' list
Unnecessary Abstraction,CubePDF.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CubePDF,Ret,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\Splitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: list
Deficient Encapsulation,CubePDF,Ret,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\Splitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: list
Insufficient Modularization,CubePDF,MainForm,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 111
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CubePDF,MainForm,C:\repos\cube-soft_cubepdf-merge\cubepdf-merge\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainForm' Splitter
