Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Raven.Embedded,EmbeddedServer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\src\Raven.Embedded\EmbeddedServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Raven.Embedded,EmbeddedServer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\src\Raven.Embedded\EmbeddedServer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TryCreateDatabase which is more interested in members of the type: Logger
Imperative Abstraction,Raven.Embedded,RavenServerRunner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\src\Raven.Embedded\RavenServerRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Deficient Encapsulation,Raven.Embedded,EmbeddedServer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\src\Raven.Embedded\EmbeddedServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,Raven.Embedded,EmbeddedServer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\src\Raven.Embedded\EmbeddedServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Instance
