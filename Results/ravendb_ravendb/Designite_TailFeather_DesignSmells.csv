Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key
Unnecessary Abstraction,TailFeather,TailFeatherCommandLineOptions,C:\repos\ravendb_ravendb\ToMigrate\Rachis\TailFeather\TailFeatherCommandLineOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Port' Boostrap' DataPath' NodeName
Deficient Encapsulation,TailFeather.Storage,KeyValueOperation,C:\repos\ravendb_ravendb\ToMigrate\Rachis\TailFeather\Storage\KeyValueOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type' Key' Value
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TailFeather.Storage,KeyValueStateMachine,C:\repos\ravendb_ravendb\ToMigrate\Rachis\TailFeather\Storage\KeyValueStateMachine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TailFeather.Storage.KeyValueStateMachine' TailFeather.Storage.SnapshotWriter
