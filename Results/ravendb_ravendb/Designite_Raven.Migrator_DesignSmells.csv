Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator,AbstractMigrationConfiguration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\AbstractMigrationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Command' DatabaseName' ConsoleExport' ExportFilePath' CollectionsToMigrate
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator,Collection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\AbstractMigrationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' NewName
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator,CollectionsInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\CollectionsInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Collections
Imperative Abstraction,Raven.Migrator,CommandLineApp,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\CommandLineApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator,ExtendedCollectionsInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\DatabaseInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HasGridFS
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator,DatabasesInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\DatabasesInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Databases
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator.CosmosDB,CosmosDBConfiguration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\CosmosDB\CosmosDBConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AzureEndpointUrl' PrimaryKey
Feature Envy,Raven.Migrator.CosmosDB,CosmosDBMigrator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\CosmosDB\CosmosDBMigrator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateNewCosmosClient which is more interested in members of the type: CosmosDBConfiguration
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrator.MongoDB,MongoDBConfiguration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\tools\Raven.Migrator\MongoDB\MongoDBConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionString' MigrateGridFS
Unutilized Abstraction,Raven.Client.Extensions,StringExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\src\Raven.Client\Extensions\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
