Unutilized Abstraction,BulkInsert.Benchmark,BulkInsertBench,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\bench\BulkInsert.Benchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BulkInsert.Benchmark,BulkInsertBench,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\bench\BulkInsert.Benchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BulkInsertBench (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\bench\BulkInsert.Benchmark\Program.cs' [221' 259])' BulkInsertBench (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\bench\BulkInsert.Benchmark\Program.cs' [327' 365])
Unnecessary Abstraction,BulkInsert.Benchmark,DocEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ravendb_ravendb\bench\BulkInsert.Benchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RandomId' SerialId' SomeRandomText' Tags
