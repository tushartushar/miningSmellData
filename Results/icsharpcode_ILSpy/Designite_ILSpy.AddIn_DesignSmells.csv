Feature Envy,ICSharpCode.ILSpy.AddIn.Commands,OpenCodeItemCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\icsharpcode_ILSpy\ILSpy.AddIn\Commands\OpenCodeItemCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetRoslynDocument which is more interested in members of the type: ILSpyAddInPackage
Feature Envy,ICSharpCode.ILSpy.AddIn.Commands,ILSpyCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\icsharpcode_ILSpy\ILSpy.AddIn\Commands\OpenILSpyCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.
