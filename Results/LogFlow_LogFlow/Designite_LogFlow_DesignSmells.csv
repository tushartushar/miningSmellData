Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,LogFlow.Builtins.Outputs,ElasticSearchOutput,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\Builtins\Outputs\ElasticSearchOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Process
Unnecessary Abstraction,LogFlow.Builtins.Processors.IISLog,Constants,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\Builtins\Processors\IISLog\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HeaderField' FieldStorageKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,LogFlow.Builtins.Processors.IISLog,LogLine,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\Builtins\Processors\IISLog\LogLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TimeStamp' Fields
Unnecessary Abstraction,LogFlow.Builtins.Processors.IISLog,LogLineFields,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\Builtins\Processors\IISLog\LogLineFields.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Date' Time
Unnecessary Abstraction,LogFlow,JSonKeys,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\JSonKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LogType' MachineName
Unutilized Abstraction,LogFlow,LogFlowEngine,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\LogFlowEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LogFlow,MetaDataKeys,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\MetaDataKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' FilePath
Deficient Encapsulation,LogFlow,FlowBuilder,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\FlowBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Flows
Broken Modularization,LogFlow.Builtins.Outputs,ElasticSearchFields,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\Builtins\Outputs\ElasticSearchFields.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' TTL' Timestamp' Type' Source' Message
Rebellious Hierarchy,LogFlow,LogInput,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\ILogInput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetLine' LineIsProcessed
Wide Hierarchy,LogFlow,Flow,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\Flow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: LogFlow.Examples.ConsoleToElasticSearch' LogFlow.Examples.FileToConsoleFlow' LogFlow.Examples.FileToElasticSearch' LogFlow.Examples.RandomDataFlow' LogFlow.Specifications.Flows.EmptyFlow' LogFlow.Specifications.Flows.FlowWithoutInput' LogFlow.Specifications.Flows.FlowWithoutName' LogFlow.Specifications.Flows.FlowWithoutProcess' LogFlow.Specifications.Flows.SimpleFlow' LogFlow.Specifications.Flows.WorkingFlow
Missing Hierarchy,LogFlow,LogFlowStructure,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\LogFlowStructure.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IStartable' IStartable (in method "GetAllStartable" of class "LogFlowStructure").
Rebellious Hierarchy,LogFlow,LogOutput,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\LogOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Process
Rebellious Hierarchy,LogFlow,LogProcessor,C:\repos\LogFlow_LogFlow\source\LogFlow\LogProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Process
