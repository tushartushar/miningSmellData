Unnecessary Abstraction,Genomic.Genome,IGenome,C:\repos\tp-nscan_WpfWorklist\Genomic\Genome\IGenome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Chromosomes' Guid
Unnecessary Abstraction,Genomic.Locus,ILinkedLocus,C:\repos\tp-nscan_WpfWorklist\Genomic\Locus\ILinkedLocus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Locus' Loci' Prev' Next
Unutilized Abstraction,Genomic.Locus,SimpleCentromere,C:\repos\tp-nscan_WpfWorklist\Genomic\Locus\SimpleCentromere.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Genomic.Locus,SimpleRecomb,C:\repos\tp-nscan_WpfWorklist\Genomic\Locus\SimpleRecomb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Genomic.Locus,EmptyLocus,C:\repos\tp-nscan_WpfWorklist\Genomic\Locus\EmptyLocus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LocusBase
