Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5,SerializableConfigurationSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Logging\src\ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5\SerializableConfigurationSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5,EntLib5Logger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Logging\src\ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5\EntLib5Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5,EntLib5Factory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackV3_ServiceStack.Logging\src\ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5\EntLib5Factory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5.EntLib5Factory' ServiceStack.Logging.EntLib5.EntLib5Logger
