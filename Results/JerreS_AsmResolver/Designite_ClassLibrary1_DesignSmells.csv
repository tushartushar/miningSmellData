Deficient Encapsulation,ClassLibrary1,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JerreS_AsmResolver\Tests\Net\Dummies\ClassLibrary1\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MyField' MarshalAsArrayField' MyArray
Deficient Encapsulation,ClassLibrary1,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JerreS_AsmResolver\Tests\Net\Dummies\ClassLibrary1\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MyField' MarshalAsArrayField' MyArray
