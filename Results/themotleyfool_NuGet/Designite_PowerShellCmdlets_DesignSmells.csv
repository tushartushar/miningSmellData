Feature Envy,NuGet.PowerShell.Commands,NuGetBaseCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\themotleyfool_NuGet\src\VsConsole\PowerShellCmdlets\NuGetBaseCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetAllValidProjectNames which is more interested in members of the type: ISolutionManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGet.PowerShell.Commands,ProgressActivityIds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\themotleyfool_NuGet\src\VsConsole\PowerShellCmdlets\ProgressActivityIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' GetPackageId' DownloadPackageId
Broken Modularization,NuGet,CommonResources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\themotleyfool_NuGet\Common\CommonResources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.

Broken Modularization,NuGet.PowerShell.Commands,NuGetErrorId,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\themotleyfool_NuGet\src\VsConsole\PowerShellCmdlets\NuGetErrorId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NoCompatibleProjects' ProjectNotFound' NoActiveSolution' FileNotFound' FileExistsNoClobber' TooManySpecFiles' NuspecFileNotFound' CmdletUnhandledException
Rebellious Hierarchy,NuGet.PowerShell.Commands,FindPackageCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\themotleyfool_NuGet\src\VsConsole\PowerShellCmdlets\FindPackageCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LogCore
Rebellious Hierarchy,NuGet.PowerShell.Commands,UpdatePackageCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\themotleyfool_NuGet\src\VsConsole\PowerShellCmdlets\UpdatePackageCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
