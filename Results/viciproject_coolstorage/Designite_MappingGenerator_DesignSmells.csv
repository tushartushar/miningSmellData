Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,MappingGenerator,Generator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\viciproject_coolstorage\tools\MappingGenerator\Generator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateMappingFiles
Unutilized Abstraction,MappingGenerator,GeneratorExtMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\viciproject_coolstorage\tools\MappingGenerator\GeneratorExtMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MappingGenerator,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\viciproject_coolstorage\tools\MappingGenerator\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Deficient Encapsulation,MappingGenerator,Table,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\viciproject_coolstorage\tools\MappingGenerator\Table.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Fields
Broken Modularization,MappingGenerator,Field,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\viciproject_coolstorage\tools\MappingGenerator\Field.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' IsPrimaryKey' IsReadOnly' IsIdentity' Table' Type' Size' Scale' AllowNull' IsUnique' DefaultValue' IsExpression' CompilerTypeName
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MappingGenerator,Field,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\viciproject_coolstorage\tools\MappingGenerator\Field.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MappingGenerator.Field' MappingGenerator.Table
