Unutilized Abstraction,CacheSleeve,Nested,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\CacheManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CacheSleeve.Models,Overview,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\Models\Overview.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RemoteKeys' LocalKeys
Unutilized Abstraction,CacheSleeve.Utilities,UnitTestDetector,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\Utilities\UnitTestDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,CacheManager,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\CacheManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.CacheManager' CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,HttpContextCacher,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\HttpContextCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher' CacheSleeve.CacheManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,HttpContextCacher,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\HttpContextCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher' CacheSleeve.CacheManager' CacheSleeve.RedisCacher
Insufficient Modularization,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.RedisCacher' CacheSleeve.CacheManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,C:\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.RedisCacher' CacheSleeve.CacheManager' CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher
