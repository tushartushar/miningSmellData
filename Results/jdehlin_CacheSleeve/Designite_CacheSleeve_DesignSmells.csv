Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TimeToLive which is more interested in members of the type: ICacheManager
Feature Envy,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetDependencies which is more interested in members of the type: ICacheManager

Unnecessary Abstraction,CacheSleeve.Models,Overview,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\Models\Overview.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RemoteKeys' LocalKeys
Unutilized Abstraction,CacheSleeve.Utilities,UnitTestDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\Utilities\UnitTestDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,CacheManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\CacheManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.CacheManager' CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,ICacheManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\ICacheManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.ICacheManager' CacheSleeve.RedisCacher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.RedisCacher' CacheSleeve.CacheManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,CacheManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\CacheManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.CacheManager' CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher' CacheSleeve.ICacheManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,HttpContextCacher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\HttpContextCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CacheSleeve.HttpContextCacher' CacheSleeve.CacheManager' CacheSleeve.RedisCacher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CacheSleeve,RedisCacher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jdehlin_CacheSleeve\CacheSleeve.NET40\RedisCacher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
