Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Processor.UnitTests,FunctionalProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\FunctionalProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Processor.UnitTests,ProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Processor.UnitTests,ProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ProcessorTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs' [2354' 2374])' ProcessorTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs' [2387' 2407])
Deficient Encapsulation,Processor.UnitTests,FunctionalProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\FunctionalProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: KdTestProgram' InterruptProgram' CycleProgram' CycleTestDataResults
Insufficient Modularization,Processor.UnitTests,ProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 178 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Processor.UnitTests,ProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 178 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Processor.UnitTests,ProcessorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\ProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 204
Broken Modularization,Processor.UnitTests,TestData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor.UnitTests\TestData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Accumulator' XRegister' YRegister' StackPointer' Flags' CycleCount' ProgramCounter
