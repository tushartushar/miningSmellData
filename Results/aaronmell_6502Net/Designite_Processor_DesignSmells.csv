Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Processor,Disassembly,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Disassembly.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LowAddress' HighAddress' OpCodeString' DisassemblyOutput
Unutilized Abstraction,Processor,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Processor,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Processor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs' [2040' 2059])' Processor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs' [2200' 2219])
Duplicate Abstraction,Processor,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Processor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs' [2253' 2274])' Processor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs' [2302' 2323])
Imperative Abstraction,Processor,Utility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Utility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConvertOpCodeIntoString
Unutilized Abstraction,Processor,Utility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Utility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Processor,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Processor,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aaronmell_6502Net\Processor\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 279
