Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Logging,ILogDestination,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILogDestination.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILogDestination (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILogDestination.cs' [1' 26])' StreamLogDestination (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\StreamLogDestination.cs' [1' 26])' LogMessageType (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Log.cs' [1' 26])
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Logging,ILogDestination,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILogDestination.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILogDestination (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILogDestination.cs' [1' 20])' Timer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Timer.cs' [1' 20])' StreamLogDestination (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\StreamLogDestination.cs' [1' 20])' LogMessageType (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Log.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Logging,Timer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Timer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Logging,ILogFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILogFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILogFilter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILogFilter.cs' [1' 20])' FunctionLogDestination (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\LambdaSupport.cs' [1' 20])
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Logging,LogEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\LogEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: When
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Logging,Log,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Log.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Logging,LogScope,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\LogScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.Library.Logging.LogScope' Duplicati.Library.Logging.Log
