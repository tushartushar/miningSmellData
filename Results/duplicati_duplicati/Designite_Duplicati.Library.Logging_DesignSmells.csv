Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Logging,ILog,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILog (C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\ILog.cs' [1' 26])' LogMessageType (C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Log.cs' [1' 26])' StreamLog (C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\StreamLog.cs' [1' 26])' Timer (C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Timer.cs' [1' 26])
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Logging,Timer,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Timer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Logging,LogScope,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\LogScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Log' LogLevel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Logging,Log,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\Log.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.Library.Logging.Log' Duplicati.Library.Logging.LogScope
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Logging,LogScope,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Logging\LogScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.Library.Logging.LogScope' Duplicati.Library.Logging.Log
