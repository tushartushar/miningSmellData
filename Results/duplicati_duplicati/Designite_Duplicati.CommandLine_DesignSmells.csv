Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Duplicati.CommandLine,Help,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Help.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: PrintUsage
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Program' Duplicati.CommandLine.Strings.Program
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FROM_COMMANDLINE
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: FROM_COMMANDLINE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Help,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Help.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Help' Duplicati.CommandLine.Commands' Duplicati.CommandLine.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Matcher,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Help.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Matcher' Duplicati.CommandLine.Help' Duplicati.CommandLine.Commands' Duplicati.CommandLine.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Program' Duplicati.CommandLine.Help' Duplicati.CommandLine.Commands
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Program' Duplicati.CommandLine.Matcher' Duplicati.CommandLine.Help' Duplicati.CommandLine.Commands
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Commands,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Commands,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Commands' Duplicati.CommandLine.Program' Duplicati.CommandLine.Help
Missing Hierarchy,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: UserInformationException' CancelException (in method "RunCommandLine" of class "Program").
