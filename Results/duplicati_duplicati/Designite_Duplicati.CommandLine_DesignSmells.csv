Imperative Abstraction,Duplicati.CommandLine,Help,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Help.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: PrintUsage
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.CommandLine,Help,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Help.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.CommandLine.Program' Duplicati.CommandLine.Strings.Program
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.CommandLine.Strings,Program,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FROM_COMMANDLINE
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.CommandLine,Program,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: FROM_COMMANDLINE
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Help,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Help.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 118
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.CommandLine,Commands,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\CommandLine\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 137
