Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Localization,MoLocalizationService,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Localization\MoLocalizationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SearchPaths' SearchAssembly
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Localization,MoLocalizationService,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Localization\MoLocalizationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SearchPaths' SearchAssembly
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Localization,MoLocalizationService,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Localization\MoLocalizationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MoLocalizationService' LocalizationService
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Localization,LocalizationContext,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Localization\LocalizationContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LocalizationContext' LocalizationService
