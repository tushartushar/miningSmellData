Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings,SharePoint,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings,OneDriveForBusiness,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings,OneDriveForBusiness,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Backend,SharePointBackend,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\SharePointBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 107
Unfactored Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,OneDriveForBusinessBackend,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\OneDriveForBusinessBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: OneDriveForBusinessBackend[1' 22]' SharePointBackend[1' 22]
Broken Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,OneDriveForBusinessBackend,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\OneDriveForBusinessBackend.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SharePointBackend
Multipath Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,SharePointBackend,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SharePoint\SharePointBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IBackend
