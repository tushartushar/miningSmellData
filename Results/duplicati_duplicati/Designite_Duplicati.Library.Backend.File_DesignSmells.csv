Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,File,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\FileBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  File (C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\FileBackend.cs' [1' 21])' Win32 (C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\Win32.cs' [1' 21])
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Backend,NETRESOURCE,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwScope' dwType' dwDisplayType' dwUsage' LocalName' RemoteName' Comment' Provider
Broken Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Backend,NETRESOURCE,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwScope' dwType' dwDisplayType' dwUsage' LocalName' RemoteName' Comment' Provider
Multipath Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,File,C:\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\FileBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IBackend
