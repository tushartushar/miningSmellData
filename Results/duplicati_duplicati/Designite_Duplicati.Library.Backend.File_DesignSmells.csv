Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,File,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\FileBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: List which is more interested in members of the type: ISystemIO
Feature Envy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,File,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\FileBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PutAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ISystemIO
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Backend,NETRESOURCE,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwScope' dwType' dwDisplayType' dwUsage' LocalName' RemoteName' Comment' Provider
Broken Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Backend,NETRESOURCE,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwScope' dwType' dwDisplayType' dwUsage' LocalName' RemoteName' Comment' Provider
Multipath Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,File,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\File\FileBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IBackend
