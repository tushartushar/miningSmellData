Imperative Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,KeyGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\KeyGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,KeyGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\KeyGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,KeyGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\KeyGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Backend.KeyGenerator' Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings.KeyGenerator
Imperative Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,KeyUploader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\KeyUploader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,KeyUploader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\KeyUploader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend,KeyUploader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\KeyUploader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Backend.KeyUploader' Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings.KeyUploader
Broken Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings,KeyGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' DisplayName' KeyUsernameShort' KeyUsernameLong' KeyTypeShort' KeyTypeLong' KeyLenShort' KeyLenLong
Broken Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings,KeyUploader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' DisplayName' UrlShort' UrlLong' PubkeyShort' PubkeyLong
Multipath Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Backend,SSHv2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\SSHv2\SSHv2Backend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IBackend
