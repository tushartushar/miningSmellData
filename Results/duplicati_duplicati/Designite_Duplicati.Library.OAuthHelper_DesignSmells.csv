Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library,OAuthHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\OAuthHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library,OAuthSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\OAuthHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ServerURL
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library,OAuthHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\OAuthHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.OAuthHelper' Duplicati.Library.Strings.OAuthHelper
Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library,OAuth_Service_Response,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\OAuthHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: access_token' expires' v2_authid
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library,OAuthSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\OAuthHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServerURL
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library,JSONWebHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\JSONWebHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Duplicati.Library,OAuthContextSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\OAuthHelper\OAuthHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Duplicati.Library.OAuthContextSettings' Duplicati.Library.OAuthHelper
