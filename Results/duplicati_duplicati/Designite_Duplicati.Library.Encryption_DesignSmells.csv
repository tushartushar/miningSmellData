Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Encryption,AESEncryption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\AESEncryption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Encryption.AESEncryption' Duplicati.Library.Encryption.Strings.AESEncryption
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Encryption,EncryptionBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\EncryptionBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Encryption.EncryptionBase' Duplicati.Library.Encryption.Strings.EncryptionBase
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Encryption,EncryptionBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\EncryptionBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  EncryptionBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\EncryptionBase.cs' [1' 20])' GPGStreamWrapper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\GPGStreamWrapper.cs' [1' 20])
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Encryption,GPGEncryption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\GPGEncryption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Encryption.GPGEncryption' Duplicati.Library.Encryption.Strings.GPGEncryption
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Encryption,GPGStreamWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\GPGStreamWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Encryption.GPGStreamWrapper' Duplicati.Library.Encryption.Strings.GPGStreamWrapper
Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Encryption.Strings,AESEncryption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description_v2' DisplayName' EmptyKeyError' AessetthreadlevelLong' AessetthreadlevelShort
Broken Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Encryption.Strings,AESEncryption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description_v2' DisplayName' EmptyKeyError' AessetthreadlevelLong' AessetthreadlevelShort
Unfactored Hierarchy,Duplicati.Library.Encryption,AESEncryption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\AESEncryption.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  AESEncryption (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\AESEncryption.cs' [1' 23])' GPGEncryption (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Encryption\GPGEncryption.cs' [1' 23])
