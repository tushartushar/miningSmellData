Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,WriterMetaData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\VssBackupComponents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' LogicalPath' Guid' Paths
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,VssBackupComponents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\VssBackupComponents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,DefineDosDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\DefineDosDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,SystemIOLinux,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\SystemIOLinux.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 45 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,SystemIOLinux,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\SystemIOLinux.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,SystemIOWindows,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\SystemIOWindows.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,SystemIOWindows,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\SystemIOWindows.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 56 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Common.IO,ISystemIO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Common\IO\ISystemIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
