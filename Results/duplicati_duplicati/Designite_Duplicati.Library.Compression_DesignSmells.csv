Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Compression,FileArchiveZip,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Compression\FileArchiveZip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Compression.FileArchiveZip' Duplicati.Library.Compression.Strings.FileArchiveZip
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Compression,SevenZipCompression,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Compression\SevenZipCompression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Compression.SevenZipCompression' Duplicati.Library.Compression.Strings.SevenZipCompression
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Compression.Strings,FileArchiveZip,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Compression\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Compression.Strings,SevenZipCompression,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Compression\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.Library.Compression,FileArchiveZip,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Compression\FileArchiveZip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_using_reader
Broken Modularization,Duplicati.Library.Compression.Strings,SevenZipCompression,F:\newReposMay17\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Compression\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NoWriterError' NoReaderError' FileNotFoundError' Description' DisplayName' ThreadcountLong' ThreadcountShort' CompressionlevelLong' CompressionlevelShort' FastalgoLong' FastalgoShort
