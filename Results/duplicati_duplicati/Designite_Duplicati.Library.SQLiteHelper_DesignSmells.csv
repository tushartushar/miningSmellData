Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper.DBSchemaUpgrades,DbUpgradesRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\DBSchemaUpgrades\DbUpgradesRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CodeChanges
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper,DatabaseUpgrader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\DatabaseUpgrader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper,DatabaseUpgrader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\DatabaseUpgrader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper.DatabaseUpgrader' Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper.Strings.DatabaseUpgrader
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper,DatabaseUpgrader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\DatabaseUpgrader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DatabaseUpgrader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\DatabaseUpgrader.cs' [1' 20])' SQLiteLoader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\SQLiteLoader.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.SQLiteHelper,SQLiteLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\SQLiteHelper\SQLiteLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
