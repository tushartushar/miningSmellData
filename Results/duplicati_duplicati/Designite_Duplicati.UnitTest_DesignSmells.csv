Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.UnitTest,LogHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\SVNCheckoutsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WarningCount' ErrorCount
Deficient Encapsulation,Duplicati.UnitTest,LogHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\SVNCheckoutsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: WarningCount' ErrorCount
Multipath Hierarchy,Duplicati.UnitTest,RandomErrorBackend,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\RandomErrorBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IBackend
Unfactored Hierarchy,Duplicati.UnitTest,RandomErrorBackend,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\RandomErrorBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  RandomErrorBackend (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\RandomErrorBackend.cs' [89' 108])' SizeOmittingBackend (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\SizeOmittingBackend.cs' [74' 93])
Broken Hierarchy,Duplicati.UnitTest,Issue1410,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\Issue1410.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Duplicati.UnitTest.BasicSetupHelper
Multipath Hierarchy,Duplicati.UnitTest,SizeOmittingBackend,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\SizeOmittingBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IBackend
Broken Hierarchy,Duplicati.UnitTest,Issue1723,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\Issue1723.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Duplicati.UnitTest.BasicSetupHelper
Unfactored Hierarchy,Duplicati.UnitTest,PurgeTesting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\PurgeTesting.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  PurgeTesting (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\PurgeTesting.cs' [2' 26])' FilterTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\UnitTest\FilterTest.cs' [2' 26])
