Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Sia,Sia,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\Sia\Sia.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Duplicati.Library.Backend.Sia.Sia' Duplicati.Library.Backend.Strings.Sia
Duplicate Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Sia,Sia,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\Sia\Sia.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Sia (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\Sia\Sia.cs' [142' 161])' Sia (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\Sia\Sia.cs' [196' 215])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Duplicati.Library.Backend.Sia,SiaFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\duplicati_duplicati\Duplicati\Library\Backend\Sia\Sia.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
