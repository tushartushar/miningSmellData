Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Duplicati.Library.Main' Duplicati.Library.Main.Database
Unstable Dependency,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Duplicati.Library.Main.Operation
Unstable Dependency,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main.Database,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Duplicati.Library.Main' Duplicati.Server.Database
Unstable Dependency,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main.Volumes,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Duplicati.Library.Main' Duplicati.Library.DynamicLoader
God Component,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 55
Feature Concentration,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main.Volumes,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BlockVolumeReader' VolumeReaderBase' IndexVolumeReader' BlockVolumeWriter' VolumeWriterBase' IndexVolumeWriter' FilesetVolumeReader' IFileEntry' FilesetVolumeWriter' VolumeBase]' [InvalidManifestException]' [IParsedVolume]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25
Scattered Functionality,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main.Operation,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Duplicati.Library.Main.Database' Duplicati.Library.Main.Volumes' Duplicati.Library.Main
Scattered Functionality,Duplicati.Library.Main,Duplicati.Library.Main.Operation,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern.
