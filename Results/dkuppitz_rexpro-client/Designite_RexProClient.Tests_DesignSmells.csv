Unutilized Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,ConstructorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\ConstructorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,DynamicScriptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\DynamicScriptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,DynamicScriptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\DynamicScriptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DynamicScriptTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\DynamicScriptTests.cs' [10' 37])' ScriptTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\ScriptTests.cs' [9' 36])
Feature Envy,Rexster.Tests,DynamicScriptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\DynamicScriptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UseVertexAsBinding which is more interested in members of the type: RexProClient
Unutilized Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,ResultCastTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\ResultCastTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,SessionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\SessionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Rexster.Tests,SessionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\SessionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UseSessionWithoutGraph which is more interested in members of the type: RexProClient
Feature Envy,Rexster.Tests,SessionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\SessionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UseSessionWithGraph which is more interested in members of the type: RexProClient
Unutilized Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,ScriptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\ScriptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster.Tests,TestVertex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\TestVertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster.Tests.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RexProHost' RexProPort' GraphName' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,Rexster.Tests.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient.Tests\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RexProHost' RexProPort' GraphName' defaultInstance
