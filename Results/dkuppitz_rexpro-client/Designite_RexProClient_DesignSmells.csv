Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster,Edge,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Edge.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InVertex' OutVertex' Label
Multifaceted Abstraction,Rexster,RexProClient,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\RexProClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster,Vertex,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Vertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster.Messages,DynamicScriptResponse,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\DynamicScriptResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster.Messages,ErrorResponseMetaData,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\ErrorResponseMetaData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Flag
Unutilized Abstraction,Rexster.Messages,ErrorResponseMetaData,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\ErrorResponseMetaData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rexster.Messages,MessageType,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\MessageType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Error' SessionRequest' SessionResponse' ScriptRequest' ScriptResponse
Deficient Encapsulation,Rexster,GraphItem,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\GraphItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id
Unexloited Encapsulation,Rexster,RexProClient,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\RexProClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SessionRequest' ScriptRequest (in method "BuildRequestMessageBuffer" of class "RexProClient").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rexster,RexProClient,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\RexProClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RexProClient' RexProSession
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rexster,RexProClient,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\RexProClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RexProClient' RexProSession' SessionRequest
Broken Modularization,Rexster.Messages,MessageType,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\MessageType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Error' SessionRequest' SessionResponse' ScriptRequest' ScriptResponse
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rexster.Messages,SessionRequest,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\SessionRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SessionRequest' RexProClient' RexProSession' RexProClient' RexProSession
Broken Hierarchy,Rexster.Messages,DynamicScriptResponse,C:\repos\dkuppitz_rexpro-client\RexProClient\Messages\DynamicScriptResponse.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ScriptResponse
