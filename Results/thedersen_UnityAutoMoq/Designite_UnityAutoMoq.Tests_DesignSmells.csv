Unutilized Abstraction,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Mocked_object_and_resolved_instance_should_be_the_same which is more interested in members of the type: UnityAutoMoqContainer
Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.

Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Getting_mock_after_resolving_concrete_type_should_return_the_same_mock_as_passed_as_argument_to_the_concrete which is more interested in members of the type: UnityAutoMoqContainer
Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_configure_mock_as_several_interfaces which is more interested in members of the type: UnityAutoMoqContainer
Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_configure_mock_as_several_interfaces_2 which is more interested in members of the type: UnityAutoMoqContainer
Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_inject_mocked_abstract_class which is more interested in members of the type: UnityAutoMoqContainer
Feature Envy,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\UnityAutoMoqContainerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_get_registered_implementation which is more interested in members of the type: UnityAutoMoqContainer
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityAutoMoq.Tests,LazyService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thedersen_UnityAutoMoq\src\UnityAutoMoq.Tests\LazyService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServiceFunc
