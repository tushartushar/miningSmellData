(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Entelect.ErrorHandling,LogicError,C:\repos\entelect_Entelect\src\Entelect\ErrorHandling\LogicError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogicError' LogicException
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Entelect.ErrorHandling,LogicError,C:\repos\entelect_Entelect\src\Entelect\ErrorHandling\LogicError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogicError' LogicErrors' LogicException
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Entelect.ErrorHandling,LogicError,C:\repos\entelect_Entelect\src\Entelect\ErrorHandling\LogicError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogicError' LogicException' LogicErrors' LogicException
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Entelect.ErrorHandling,LogicError,C:\repos\entelect_Entelect\src\Entelect\ErrorHandling\LogicError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogicError' LogicErrors' LogicException' LogicErrors' LogicException
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Entelect.ErrorHandling,LogicErrors,C:\repos\entelect_Entelect\src\Entelect\ErrorHandling\LogicErrors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogicErrors' LogicException
Broken Hierarchy,Entelect.ErrorHandling,ArgumentNullError,C:\repos\entelect_Entelect\src\Entelect\ErrorHandling\ArgumentNullError.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LogicError
