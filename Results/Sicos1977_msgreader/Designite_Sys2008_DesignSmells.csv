Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Itenso.Sys.Application,ApplicationInfo,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Application\ApplicationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Itenso.Sys.Application,ApplicationArguments,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Application\ApplicationArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Itenso.Sys.Application,Argument,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Application\Argument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Load
Unutilized Abstraction,Itenso.Sys,ArgumentCheck,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\ArgumentCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Itenso.Sys,HashTool,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\HashTool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HashTool (C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\HashTool.cs' [21' 58])' CollectionTool (C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Collection\CollectionTool.cs' [77' 114])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Itenso.Sys,VersionInfo,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Properties\VersionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AssemblyVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,Itenso.Sys,VersionInfo,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Properties\VersionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Itenso.Sys.Application,ApplicationInfo,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Application\ApplicationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Version' VersionName' ShortVersionName' Title' Copyright' Caption' ShortCaption
Insufficient Modularization,Itenso.Sys.Collection,StringCollection,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Collection\StringCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Itenso.Sys.Application,HelpModeArgument,C:\repos\Sicos1977_msgreader\Sys\Application\HelpModeArgument.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Itenso.Sys.Application.ToggleArgument
