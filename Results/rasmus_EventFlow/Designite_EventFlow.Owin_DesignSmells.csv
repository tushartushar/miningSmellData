Unnecessary Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin,EventFlowOwin,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\EventFlowOwin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Assembly
Duplicate Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin,EventFlowOwin,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\EventFlowOwin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  EventFlowOwin (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\EventFlowOwin.cs' [1' 23])' EventFlowOptionsExtensions (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\Extensions\EventFlowOptionsExtensions.cs' [1' 23])' AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider.cs' [1' 23])' AddUriMetadataProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddUriMetadataProvider.cs' [1' 23])' AddUserHostAddressMetadataProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddUserHostAddressMetadataProvider.cs' [1' 23])' CommandPublishMiddleware (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\Middlewares\CommandPublishMiddleware.cs' [1' 23])
Unutilized Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin.Extensions,EventFlowOptionsExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\Extensions\EventFlowOptionsExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin.MetadataProviders,AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider.cs' [1' 24])' CommandPublishMiddleware (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\Middlewares\CommandPublishMiddleware.cs' [1' 24])' AddUriMetadataProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddUriMetadataProvider.cs' [1' 24])' AddUserHostAddressMetadataProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\MetadataProviders\AddUserHostAddressMetadataProvider.cs' [1' 24])
Imperative Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin.Middlewares,CommandPublishMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\Middlewares\CommandPublishMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Invoke
Unutilized Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin.Middlewares,CommandPublishMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\Middlewares\CommandPublishMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
