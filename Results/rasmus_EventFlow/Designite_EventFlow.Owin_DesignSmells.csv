Unnecessary Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin,EventFlowOwin,C:\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\EventFlowOwin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Assembly
Duplicate Abstraction,EventFlow.Owin,EventFlowOwin,C:\repos\rasmus_EventFlow\Source\EventFlow.Owin\EventFlowOwin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
