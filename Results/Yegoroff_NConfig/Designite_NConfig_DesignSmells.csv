Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig,ConfigurationExtension,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\Util\ConfigurationExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig,MemoizeExtensions,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\Util\MemoizeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig,IListExtension,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\Util\IListExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NConfig,INConfigSettings,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\INConfigSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HostAlias' IsWeb
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig,INConfigSettingsExtension,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\INConfigSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig,INConfigurationExtensions,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\INConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NConfig,HostMapSection,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\HostMap\HostMapSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Mappings
Rebellious Hierarchy,NConfig,NWebSystemConfigurator,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\Implementation\System\Web\NWebSystemConfigurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RestoreSystemConfiguration
Broken Hierarchy,NConfig,ReflectionAccessor<T>,C:\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig\Implementation\System\ReflectionAccessor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NConfig.ReflectionAccessor
