Unnecessary Abstraction,NConfig.Tests,TestElementCollectionElement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\DeepMergerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,NConfig.Tests,MergeSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\MergeSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StringValue' IntValue' BoolValue
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig.Tests,PropertyLevelMergerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\PropertyLevelMergerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig.Tests,TestSectionHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\TestSectionHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NConfig.Tests,TestSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\TestSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Unutilized Abstraction,NConfig.Tests,NConfiguratorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\NConfiguratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,NConfig.Tests,DeepMergerTestSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\DeepMergerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ClearCollection' RemoveCollection' SubCollection' OverriddenProperty' JumpOverProperty' NewEmptyProperty' NewNullProperty
Insufficient Modularization,NConfig.Tests,NConfiguratorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\NConfiguratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,NConfig.Tests,ConfigurationRepositoryAbsoltePathTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Yegoroff_NConfig\NConfig.Tests\ConfigurationRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NConfig.ConfigurationRepository
