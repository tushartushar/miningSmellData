Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NMaier.GetOptNet,ProgrammingError,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\Exceptional\ProgrammingError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMaier.GetOptNet,CountedArgument,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\Attributes\CountedArgument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMaier.GetOptNet,MultipleArguments,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\Attributes\MultipleArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exact' Max' Min
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMaier.GetOptNet,Parameters,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\Attributes\Parameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exact' HelpVar' Max' Min' helpVar
Insufficient Modularization,NMaier.GetOptNet,GetOpt,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\GetOpt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Broken Modularization,NMaier.GetOptNet,GetOptOptions,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\Attributes\GetOptOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AcceptPrefixType' CaseType' OnUnknownArgument' UsageEpilog' UsageIntro' UsagePrefix' UsageShowAliases' apt' act' upt' uaa' aso' usageIntro' usageEpilog
Broken Modularization,NMaier.GetOptNet,Parameters,C:\repos\nmaier_getoptnet\Attributes\Parameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exact' HelpVar' Max' Min' helpVar
