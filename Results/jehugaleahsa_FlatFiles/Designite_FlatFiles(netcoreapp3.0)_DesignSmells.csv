List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FixedLengthWriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\FixedLengthWriter.cs' [140' 167])' SeparatedValueWriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\SeparatedValueWriter.cs' [162' 189])
Unfactored Hierarchy,FlatFiles,FixedLengthWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\FixedLengthWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FixedLengthWriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\FixedLengthWriter.cs' [178' 252])' SeparatedValueWriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\SeparatedValueWriter.cs' [200' 274])
Unfactored Hierarchy,FlatFiles,Int16Column,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\Int16Column.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  Int16Column (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\Int16Column.cs' [16' 35])' Int32Column (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\Int32Column.cs' [16' 35])' Int64Column (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\Int64Column.cs' [16' 35])' UInt16Column (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\UInt16Column.cs' [16' 35])' UInt64Column (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\UInt64Column.cs' [16' 35])
Rebellious Hierarchy,FlatFiles,NullFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\NullFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: IsNullValue' FormatNull
Multipath Hierarchy,FlatFiles,SeparatedValueReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\SeparatedValueReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IReader
Broken Hierarchy,FlatFiles,SeparatedValueSchema,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\SeparatedValueSchema.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FlatFiles.Schema
Multipath Hierarchy,FlatFiles,SeparatedValueWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\SeparatedValueWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IWriter
Cyclic Hierarchy,FlatFiles.TypeMapping,IFixedLengthTypeConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\TypeMapping\FixedLengthTypeMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IFixedLengthTypeMapper
Wide Hierarchy,FlatFiles.TypeMapping,IMemberMapping,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\TypeMapping\IMemberMapping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: FlatFiles.TypeMapping.BooleanPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.ByteArrayPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.BytePropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.CharArrayPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.CharPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.CustomMapping<TEntity>' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.DateTimeOffsetPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.DateTimePropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.DecimalPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.DoublePropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.EnumPropertyMapping<TEnum>' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.FixedLengthComplexPropertyMapping<TEntity>' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.GuidPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.IgnoredMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.Int16PropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.Int32PropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.Int64PropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.SBytePropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.SeparatedValueComplexPropertyMapping<TEntity>' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.SinglePropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.StringPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.TimeSpanPropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.UInt16PropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.UInt32PropertyMapping' FlatFiles.TypeMapping.UInt64PropertyMapping
Cyclic Hierarchy,FlatFiles.TypeMapping,ISeparatedValueTypeConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_FlatFiles\FlatFiles\TypeMapping\SeparatedValueTypeMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ISeparatedValueTypeMapper
