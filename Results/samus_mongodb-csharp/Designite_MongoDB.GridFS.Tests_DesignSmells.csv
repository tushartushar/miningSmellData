Feature Envy,MongoDB.GridFS,GridFileStreamTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\samus_mongodb-csharp\source\MongoDB.GridFS.Tests\GridFileStreamTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestWriteWithMultipleFlushes which is more interested in members of the type: GridFile
