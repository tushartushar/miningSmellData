Feature Envy,Simple,MainClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\samus_mongodb-csharp\examples\Simple\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Run which is more interested in members of the type: IMongoCollection
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simple,MyClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\samus_mongodb-csharp\examples\Simple\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Corners
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simple,SubClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\samus_mongodb-csharp\examples\Simple\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Ratio
Unutilized Abstraction,Simple,OidExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\samus_mongodb-csharp\examples\Simple\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
