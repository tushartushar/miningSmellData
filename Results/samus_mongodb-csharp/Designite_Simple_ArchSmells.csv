Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.53  All the dependencies among components: from: Simple' to: MongoDB' from: Simple' to: MongoDB.Configuration' from: Simple' to: MongoDB.Configuration.Builders' from: MongoDB' to:
