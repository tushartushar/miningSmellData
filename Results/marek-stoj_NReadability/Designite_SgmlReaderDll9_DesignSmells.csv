Insufficient Modularization,Sgml,SgmlDtd,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marek-stoj_NReadability\Src\SgmlReader 1.8.7\sgmlreaderdll\SgmlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 115
Insufficient Modularization,Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marek-stoj_NReadability\Src\SgmlReader 1.8.7\sgmlreaderdll\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marek-stoj_NReadability\Src\SgmlReader 1.8.7\sgmlreaderdll\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marek-stoj_NReadability\Src\SgmlReader 1.8.7\sgmlreaderdll\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex.

Rebellious Hierarchy,Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marek-stoj_NReadability\Src\SgmlReader 1.8.7\sgmlreaderdll\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResolveEntity
