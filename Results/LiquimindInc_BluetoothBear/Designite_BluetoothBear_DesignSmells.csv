Duplicate Abstraction,BluetoothBear,BleDevice,C:\repos\LiquimindInc_BluetoothBear\BluetoothBear\BleDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BleDevice[1' 24]' BleConnectionState[1' 24]' BleConnectionStateChangedEventArgs[1' 24]' BleGattOperationState[1' 24]' XBleDevice[1' 24]
Duplicate Abstraction,BluetoothBear,BleConnectionState,C:\repos\LiquimindInc_BluetoothBear\BluetoothBear\IBleDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BleConnectionState[1' 30]' BleConnectionStateChangedEventArgs[1' 30]' BleGattOperationState[1' 30]' XBleDevice[1' 30]
Duplicate Abstraction,BluetoothBear,BleConnectionState,C:\repos\LiquimindInc_BluetoothBear\BluetoothBear\IBleDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BleConnectionState[1' 31]' BleGattOperationState[1' 31]' XBleDevice[1' 31]
Unutilized Abstraction,BluetoothBear,IBleManager,C:\repos\LiquimindInc_BluetoothBear\BluetoothBear\IBleManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,BluetoothBear,BleDevice,C:\repos\LiquimindInc_BluetoothBear\BluetoothBear\BleDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,BluetoothBear,BleDevice,C:\repos\LiquimindInc_BluetoothBear\BluetoothBear\BleDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect' Disconnect' DiscoverServices' EnableNotifications' ReadCharacteristic' WriteCharacteristic
