Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,WsFederationDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\WsFederationDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' UserstatePropertiesKey
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,WsFederationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\WsFederationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Validate
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,LoggingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,WsFederationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\WsFederationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,AuthenticationFailedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\AuthenticationFailedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.AuthenticationFailedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,MessageReceivedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\MessageReceivedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.MessageReceivedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,RedirectContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\RedirectContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.RedirectContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,RemoteSignOutContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\RemoteSignoutContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.RemoteSignOutContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,SecurityTokenReceivedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\SecurityTokenReceivedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.SecurityTokenReceivedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,SecurityTokenValidatedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\SecurityTokenValidatedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.SecurityTokenValidatedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation.WsFederationOptions
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,WsFederationEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\Events\WsFederationEvents.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationEvents
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation,WsFederationHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation\WsFederationHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
