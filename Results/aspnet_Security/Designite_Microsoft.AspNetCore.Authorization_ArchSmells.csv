Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizationPolicyBuilder' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.AssertionRequirement,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizationPolicyBuilder' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.AssertionRequirement
Unstable Dependency,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AssertionRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.ClaimsAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.NameAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.RolesAuthorizationRequirement,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AssertionRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.ClaimsAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.NameAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.RolesAuthorizationRequirement
Feature Concentration,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AssertionRequirement]' [ClaimsAuthorizationRequirement]' [DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement]' [NameAuthorizationRequirement]' [OperationAuthorizationRequirement]' [PassThroughAuthorizationHandler]' [RolesAuthorizationRequirement]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.ClaimsAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.NameAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.OperationAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.PassThroughAuthorizationHandler' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.RolesAuthorizationRequirement,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.AssertionRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.ClaimsAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.NameAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.OperationAuthorizationRequirement' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.PassThroughAuthorizationHandler' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.Infrastructure.RolesAuthorizationRequirement
