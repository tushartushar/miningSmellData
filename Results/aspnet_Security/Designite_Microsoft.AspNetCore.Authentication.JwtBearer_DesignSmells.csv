Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,JwtBearerDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\JwtBearerDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,JwtBearerAppBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\JwtBearerAppBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,JwtBearerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\JwtBearerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,LoggingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,JwtBearerOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\JwtBearerOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequireHttpsMetadata' MetadataAddress' Authority' Audience' Challenge' Events' BackchannelHttpHandler' BackchannelTimeout' Configuration' ConfigurationManager' RefreshOnIssuerKeyNotFound' SecurityTokenValidators' TokenValidationParameters' SaveToken' IncludeErrorDetails
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,AuthenticationFailedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\Events\AuthenticationFailedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.AuthenticationFailedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,JwtBearerChallengeContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\Events\JwtBearerChallengeContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerChallengeContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,MessageReceivedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\Events\MessageReceivedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.MessageReceivedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,TokenValidatedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\Events\TokenValidatedContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.TokenValidatedContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerOptions
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,JwtBearerHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\JwtBearerHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer,JwtBearerOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\JwtBearerOptions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationSchemeOptions
