Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationDefaults,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' CookiePrefix' LoginPath' LogoutPath' AccessDeniedPath' ReturnUrlParameter
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationHandler,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationOptions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationOptions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationSchemeOptions
