Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' CookiePrefix' LoginPath' LogoutPath' AccessDeniedPath' ReturnUrlParameter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationEvents
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieSignedInContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationEvents
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieSigningInContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\Events\CookieSigningInContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieSigningInContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieSigningOutContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\Events\CookieSigningOutContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieValidatePrincipalContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\Events\CookieValidatePrincipalContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieValidatePrincipalContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies,CookieAuthenticationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies\CookieAuthenticationOptions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationSchemeOptions
