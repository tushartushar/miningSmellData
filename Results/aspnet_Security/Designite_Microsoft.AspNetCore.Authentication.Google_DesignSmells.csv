Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google,GoogleDefaults,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' AuthorizationEndpoint' TokenEndpoint' UserInformationEndpoint
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google,GoogleOptions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleOptions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions
