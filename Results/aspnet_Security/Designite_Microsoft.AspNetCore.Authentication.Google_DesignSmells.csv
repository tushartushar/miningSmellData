Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,GoogleAppBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleAppBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google,GoogleDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' AuthorizationEndpoint' TokenEndpoint' UserInformationEndpoint
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,GoogleExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google,GoogleDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' AuthorizationEndpoint' TokenEndpoint' UserInformationEndpoint
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google,GoogleChallengeProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleChallengeProperties.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthChallengeProperties
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google,GoogleOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google\GoogleOptions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions
