Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\Claims\ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth,OAuthDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\OAuthDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DisplayName
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,OAuthAppBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\OAuthAppBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,OAuthExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\OAuthExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth,OAuthEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\Events\OAuthEvents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth,OAuthCreatingTicketContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\Events\OAuthCreatingTicketContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthCreatingTicketContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth,OAuthEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\Events\OAuthEvents.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationEvents
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth,OAuthHandler<TOptions>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth\OAuthHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
