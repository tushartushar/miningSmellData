Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\Claims\ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectHandler,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OpenIdConnectHandler (C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectHandler.cs' [241' 267])' OpenIdConnectHandler (C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectHandler.cs' [422' 448])
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectOptions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Validate
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectNonceCookieBuilder,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectPostConfigureOptions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectPostConfigureOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,StringSerializer,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectPostConfigureOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,LoggingExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,OpenIdConnectAppBuilderExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectAppBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,OpenIdConnectExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectDefaults,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationPropertiesKey' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' CookieNoncePrefix' RedirectUriForCodePropertiesKey' UserstatePropertiesKey
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectHandler,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 133
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,LoggingExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 49 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,LoggingExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect,OpenIdConnectHandler,C:\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect\OpenIdConnectHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
