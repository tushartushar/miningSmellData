Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,AccessToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\Messages\AccessToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UserId' ScreenName
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,RequestToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\Messages\RequestToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Token' TokenSecret' CallbackConfirmed' Properties
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,TwitterDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\TwitterDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' RequestTokenEndpoint' AuthenticationEndpoint' AccessTokenEndpoint
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,LoggingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,TwitterAppBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\TwitterAppBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,TwitterExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\TwitterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,TwitterDefaults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\TwitterDefaults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AuthenticationScheme' DisplayName' RequestTokenEndpoint' AuthenticationEndpoint' AccessTokenEndpoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,TwitterEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\Events\TwitterEvents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter.TwitterEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter.TwitterOptions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,TwitterCreatingTicketContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\Events\TwitterCreatingTicketContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter.TwitterCreatingTicketContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter.TwitterEvents' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter.TwitterOptions
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter,TwitterHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Security\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter\TwitterHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateEventsAsync
