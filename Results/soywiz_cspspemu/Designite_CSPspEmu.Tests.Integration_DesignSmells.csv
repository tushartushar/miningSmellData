Duplicate Abstraction,CSPspEmu.AutoTests,HleOutputHandlerMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soywiz_cspspemu\CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration\AutoTestsProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: CSPspEmu.AutoTests.HleOutputHandlerMock' CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration.HleOutputHandlerMock
Unutilized Abstraction,CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration,UnitTest1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soywiz_cspspemu\CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration\UnitTest1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration,ITestOutputHelperExt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soywiz_cspspemu\CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration\UnitTest1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CSPspEmu.AutoTests,AutoTestsProgram,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soywiz_cspspemu\CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration\AutoTestsProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HleConfig' StoredConfig
Deficient Encapsulation,CSPspEmu.AutoTests,HleOutputHandlerMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soywiz_cspspemu\CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration\AutoTestsProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OutputString
Rebellious Hierarchy,CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration,HleOutputHandlerMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soywiz_cspspemu\CSPspEmu.Tests.Integration\UnitTest1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Output
