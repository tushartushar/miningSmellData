Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CSPspEmu.Runner.Components.Audio,AudioComponentThread,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Runner\Components\Audio\AudioComponentThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CSPspEmu.Runner.Components.Display,DisplayComponentThread,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Runner\Components\Display\DisplayComponentThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CSPspEmu.Runner.Components.Gpu,GpuComponentThread,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Runner\Components\Gpu\GpuComponentThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CSPspEmu.Runner.Components,ComponentThread,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Runner\Components\ComponentThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Running
Deficient Encapsulation,CSPspEmu.Runner.Components.Cpu,CpuComponentThread,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Runner\Components\Cpu\CpuComponentThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CpuProcessor' PspRtc' HleThreadManager' PspMemory' Loader' MemoryManager' HleCallbackManager' ModuleManager' HleIoManager' ThreadManForUser' MemoryStickMountable' StoppedEndedEvent
Missing Hierarchy,CSPspEmu.Runner.Components.Cpu,CpuComponentThread,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Runner\Components\Cpu\CpuComponentThread.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SceKernelSelfStopUnloadModuleException' SceKernelSelfStopUnloadModuleException (in method "Main" of class "CpuComponentThread").
