Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CSPspEmu.Debugger,IGdbProcessor,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Debugger\IGdbProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CSPspEmu.Debugger,GdbProcessorRegisters,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Debugger\GdbProcessorRegisters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GPR' CP0_STATUS' LO' HI' CP0_BADVADDR' PC' __UNK' FPR' FCSR' FIR' LINUX_RESTART
Broken Modularization,CSPspEmu.Debugger,GdbProcessorRegisters,C:\repos\soywiz_cspspemu\Core\CSPspEmu.Debugger\GdbProcessorRegisters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CO0_CAUSE' ALL' GPR' CP0_STATUS' LO' HI' CP0_BADVADDR' PC' __UNK' FPR' FCSR' FIR' LINUX_RESTART
