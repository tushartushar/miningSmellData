Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Helpers\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Helpers\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ConverterExtensions[3' 26]' GraphicsRenderContext[3' 26]' Plot[3' 26]' PngExporter[3' 26]
Duplicate Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Helpers\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ConverterExtensions[3' 25]' NamespaceDoc[3' 25]' GraphicsRenderContext[3' 25]' Plot[3' 25]' PngExporter[3' 25]
Duplicate Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,GraphicsRenderContext,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\GraphicsRenderContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GraphicsRenderContext[123' 142]' GraphicsRenderContext[181' 200]
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,NamespaceDoc,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,NamespaceDoc,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,Plot,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Plot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,PngExporter,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\PngExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,Plot,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Plot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,Plot,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Plot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
Rebellious Hierarchy,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,Plot,C:\repos\AlannaMuir_open-hardware-monitor\External\OxyPlot\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Plot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: HideTracker' ShowTracker
