Imperative Abstraction,Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.UI.Controls,ScaleLine,C:\repos\Esri_arcgis-toolkit-dotnet\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\Android\UI\Controls\ScaleLine.Android.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CalculateScale
Unutilized Abstraction,Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.UI.Controls,ScaleLine,C:\repos\Esri_arcgis-toolkit-dotnet\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\Android\UI\Controls\ScaleLine.Android.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.UI.Controls,DesignTime,C:\repos\Esri_arcgis-toolkit-dotnet\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\Shared\UI\DesignTime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsDesignMode' s_isInDesignMode
