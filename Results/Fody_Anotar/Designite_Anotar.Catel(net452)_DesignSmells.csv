Unnecessary Abstraction,Anotar.Catel,LogMinimalMessageAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Anotar\Catel\Anotar.Catel\LogMinimalMessageAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Anotar.Catel,LogMinimalMessageAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Anotar\Catel\Anotar.Catel\LogMinimalMessageAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Anotar.Catel,LogTo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Anotar\Catel\Anotar.Catel\LogTo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
