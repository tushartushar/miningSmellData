Multifaceted Abstraction,XenOvfTransport,Http,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Multifaceted Abstraction,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Unutilized Abstraction,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,XenOvfTransport,iSCSI,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\iSCSI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.85
Unutilized Abstraction,XenOvfTransport,XenOvfTransportBase,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\XenOvfTransportBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VGPU_REGEX
Deficient Encapsulation,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VGPU_REGEX
Insufficient Modularization,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 400
Broken Modularization,XenOvfTransport.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' p2vTemplate' xenP2VDiskName' xenBootOptions' xenBootOrder' xenPlatformSetting' xenNetworkKey' xenDefaultNetwork' xenISOMount' xenISOTools' xenTools' XenFixupLabel' xenSRKey' xenDeviceKey' xenNetworkUuidKey' OVFVersion' uriRegex' iSCSITargetName' iSCSINetworkName' iSCSIConnectRetry' iSCSITransferVM' iSCSITransferVMName' TransferType' xenSupportedVersions' iSCSITransferVMNetwork' DEFAULT_CULTURE' EXCLUDED_FILES_COPY' ReferenceVHDName' bzip2ext' iSCSITransferVMMgtNetwork' CreateApplianceFolder' ApplianceFolderPath' FixupOsMemorySizeAsMB' FixupDurationAsSeconds' FixupPollTimeAsMs' defaultInstance
Rebellious Hierarchy,XenOvfTransport,DiskStream,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\DiskStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' SetLength
Broken Hierarchy,XenOvfTransport,Export,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Export.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XenOvfTransportBase
Missing Hierarchy,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DataReference' VirtualSystem_Type (in method "Process" of class "Import").
Broken Hierarchy,XenOvfTransport,Import,C:\repos\aftabahmedsajid_XenCenter-Complete-dependencies-\XenOvfTransport\Import.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XenOvfTransportBase
