Deficient Encapsulation,plcdb_lib_siemens_s7,SiemensTag,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\SiemensTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DbRegex' MRegex' IRegex' QRegex' TRegex' CRegex
Deficient Encapsulation,plcdb_lib_siemens_s7,SiemensTag,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\SiemensTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DbRegex' MRegex' IRegex' QRegex' TRegex' CRegex
Deficient Encapsulation,Snap7,S7Client,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\snap7.net.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TS7BlocksOfType
Broken Modularization,Snap7,S7Consts,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\snap7.net.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Snap7LibName' p_u16_LocalPort' p_u16_RemotePort' p_i32_PingTimeout' p_i32_SendTimeout' p_i32_RecvTimeout' p_i32_WorkInterval' p_u16_SrcRef' p_u16_DstRef' p_u16_SrcTSap' p_i32_PDURequest' p_i32_MaxClients' p_i32_BSendTimeout' p_i32_BRecvTimeout' p_u32_RecoveryTime' p_u32_KeepAliveTime
Insufficient Modularization,Snap7,S7Client,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\snap7.net.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 95 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Snap7,S7Client,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\snap7.net.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 190 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Snap7,S7Client,C:\repos\joncarson_plcdb\plcdb lib siemens s7\snap7.net.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 198
