Duplicate Abstraction,Mono.Security.Cryptography,CryptoConvert,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\Mono.Security\Cryptography\CryptoConvert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CryptoConvert[9' 30]' StrongName[11' 32]
Imperative Abstraction,InsertIcons,Program,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Duplicate Abstraction,Vestris.ResourceLib,Gdi32,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Gdi32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Gdi32[114' 133]' IconImageResource[216' 235]
Duplicate Abstraction,Vestris.ResourceLib,Gdi32,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Gdi32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Gdi32[135' 156]' IconImageResource[237' 258]
Duplicate Abstraction,Vestris.ResourceLib,Gdi32,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Gdi32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Gdi32[229' 253]' Gdi32[255' 279]
Imperative Abstraction,Vestris.ResourceLib,IconImageResource,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\IconImageResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Multifaceted Abstraction,Vestris.ResourceLib,Kernel32,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Kernel32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,Vestris.ResourceLib,User32,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\User32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Security.Cryptography,CryptoConvert,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\Mono.Security\Cryptography\CryptoConvert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Vestris.ResourceLib,IconResource,F:\newReposMay17\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\IconResource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): IconImageResource
