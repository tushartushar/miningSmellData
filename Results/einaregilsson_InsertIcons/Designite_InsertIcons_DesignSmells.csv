Broken Modularization,Vestris.ResourceLib,BITMAPINFOHEADER,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Gdi32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BitmapCompression' PixelFormat' PixelFormatString' biSize' biWidth' biHeight' biPlanes' biBitCount' biCompression' biSizeImage' biXPelsPerMeter' biYPelsPerMeter' biClrUsed' biClrImportant
Broken Modularization,Vestris.ResourceLib,BITMAPFILEHEADER,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Gdi32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' bfType' bfSize' bfReserved1' bfReserved2' bfOffBits
Broken Modularization,Vestris.ResourceLib,GRPICONDIRENTRY,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\einaregilsson_InsertIcons\lib\ResourceLib\Kernel32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
