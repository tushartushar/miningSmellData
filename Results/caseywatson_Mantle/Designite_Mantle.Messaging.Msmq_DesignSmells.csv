Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mantle.Messaging.Msmq,MsmqSubscriberClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging.Msmq\MsmqSubscriberClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mantle.Messaging.Msmq.MsmqSubscriberClient' Mantle.Messaging.Msmq.MsmqSubscriberEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Msmq.MsmqSubscriberEndpointManager
Broken Hierarchy,Mantle.Messaging.Msmq,MsmqPublisherEndpointManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging.Msmq\MsmqPublisherEndpointManager.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mantle.Messaging.Msmq.MsmqEndpointManager' Mantle.Messaging.IPublisherEndpointManager
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mantle.Messaging.Msmq,MsmqSubscriberEndpointManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging.Msmq\MsmqSubscriberEndpointManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
