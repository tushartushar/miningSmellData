Unnecessary Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,ConfigurationProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\CompositePublisherEndpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ChildEndpointNames
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,IPublisherEndpointDirectory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\IPublisherEndpointDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,IPublisherEndpointManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\IPublisherEndpointManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,ISubscriberClientExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\ISubscriberClientExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,ISubscriberEndpointDirectory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\ISubscriberEndpointDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,MessageDeserializationException<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\MessageDeserializationException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mantle.Messaging,MessageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\MessageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mantle.Messaging,CompositePublisherClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\CompositePublisherClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mantle.Messaging.CompositePublisherClient' Mantle.Messaging.CompositePublisherEndpoint
Wide Hierarchy,Mantle.Messaging,Endpoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\Endpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Mantle.Messaging.CompositePublisherEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Aws.SnsPublisherEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Aws.SqsEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Azure.AzureServiceBusQueueEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Azure.AzureServiceBusSubscriptionSubscriberEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Azure.AzureServiceBusTopicPublisherEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Azure.AzureStorageQueueEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.Msmq.MsmqEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.WindowsServiceBus.WindowsServiceBusQueueEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.WindowsServiceBus.WindowsServiceBusSubscriptionSubscriberEndpoint' Mantle.Messaging.WindowsServiceBus.WindowsServiceBusTopicPublisherEndpoint
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mantle.Messaging,ISubscriberEndpointManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v0\Mantle\Mantle.Messaging\ISubscriberEndpointManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
