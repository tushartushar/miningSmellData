Unnecessary Abstraction,Mantle.Identity.Interfaces,IMantleUserRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v1\Mantle\Mantle.Identity\Interfaces\IMantleUserRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
