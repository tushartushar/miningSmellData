Insufficient Modularization,Mantle.Tests,StringExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\caseywatson_Mantle\v1\Mantle\Mantle.Tests\StringExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
