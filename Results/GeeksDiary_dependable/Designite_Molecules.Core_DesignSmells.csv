Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Molecules.Core,ReceivableAtomBuilder<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ReceivableAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Molecules.Core,Unit,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Unit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' CompletedTask
Unutilized Abstraction,Molecules.Core,WhileAtomBuilder<TTest>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\WhileAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Molecules.Core.Utilities,ExceptionUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Utilities\ExceptionUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Molecules.Core,Atom,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ConditionAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Molecules.Core,Atom,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ConditionAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Molecules.Core,AtomContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\AtomContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Molecules.Core.AtomContext' Molecules.Core.AtomContext<T>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,AtomContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\AtomContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: AtomContext<T>
Broken Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,AtomContext<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\AtomContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Molecules.Core.AtomContext
Wide Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,Atom,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ConditionAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Molecules.Core.ConditionAtom<TSource'TOut>' Molecules.Core.WithAtom<T>' Molecules.Core.ReturnAtom<T>' Molecules.Core.FuncAtom<T>' Molecules.Core.InvocableAtom<T>' Molecules.Core.ReceivableAtom<TIn'TOut>' Molecules.Core.MapAtom<TSource'TOut>' Molecules.Core.RepeatAtom<T>' Molecules.Core.CatchAtom<T>' Molecules.Core.SelectManyAtom<TFirst'TSecond'TOut>' Molecules.Core.ThenAtom<TFirst'TSecond>' Molecules.Core.WhileAtom<TTest'TOut>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,Atom,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ConditionAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ConditionAtom<TSource'TOut>
Rebellious Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,InvocableAtom<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\InvocableAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ChargeCore
Rebellious Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,ReceivableAtom<TIn;TOut>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ReceivableAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ChargeCore
