Unutilized Abstraction,Molecules.Core,ReceivableAtomBuilder,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ReceivableAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Molecules.Core,Unit,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Unit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' CompletedTask
Unutilized Abstraction,Molecules.Core,WhileAtomBuilder,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\WhileAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Molecules.Core.Utilities,ExceptionUtility,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Utilities\ExceptionUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Molecules.Core,Atom,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Atom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Molecules.Core,Atom,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Atom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Wide Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,Atom,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Atom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: ConditionAtom' WithAtom' ReturnAtom' FuncAtom' InvocableAtom' ReceivableAtom' MapAtom' RepeatAtom' CatchAtom' SelectManyAtom' ThenAtom' WhileAtom
Cyclic Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,Atom,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\Atom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CatchAtom
Rebellious Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,InvocableAtom,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\InvocableAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ChargeCore
Rebellious Hierarchy,Molecules.Core,ReceivableAtom,F:\newReposMay17\GeeksDiary_dependable\src\Molecules.Core\ReceivableAtom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ChargeCore
