Unnecessary Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.ActionFilters,TempController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\ActionFilters\JsonForQueryStringAttributeBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.ActionFilters,JsonForQueryStringAttributeBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\ActionFilters\JsonForQueryStringAttributeBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.ActionFilters,RequireBasicAuthenticationAttributeBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\ActionFilters\RequireBasicAuthenticationAttributeBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Extensions,Controller_ExtensionsBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Extensions\Controller_ExtensionsBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Extensions,ControllerTestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Extensions\Controller_ExtensionsBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Extensions,IEnumerable_SelectListExtensionsBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Extensions\IEnumerable_SelectListExtensionsBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Localization,LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Localization\LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Localization,LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Localization\LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Constructor_ShouldInitializeObject which is more interested in members of the type: ProviderWrapper
Unnecessary Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Localization,MetadataTestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Localization\LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Localization,ValidationAttributeTestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Localization\LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Hierarchy,NExtra.Mvc.Tests.Localization,ProviderWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.Mvc.Tests\Localization\LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProviderBehavior.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NExtra.Mvc.Localization.LocalizedDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider
