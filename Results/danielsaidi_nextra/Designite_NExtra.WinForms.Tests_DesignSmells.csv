Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.WinForms.Tests.Extensions,DataGridViewExtensionsBehvaior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Extensions\DataGridViewExtensionsBehvaior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NExtra.WinForms.Tests.Extensions,PictureBoxExtensionsBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Extensions\PictureBoxExtensionsBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Duplicate Abstraction,NExtra.WinForms.Tests.Printing,RichTextBoxPrinterBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Printing\RichTextBoxPrinterBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RichTextBoxPrinterBehavior (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Printing\RichTextBoxPrinterBehavior.cs' [83' 127])' PictureBoxPrinterBehavior (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Printing\PictureBoxPrinterBehavior.cs' [76' 120])
Feature Envy,NExtra.WinForms.Tests.Printing,RichTextBoxPrinterBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Printing\RichTextBoxPrinterBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PrintDocument_BeginPrint_ShouldSetPrinterMarginsAndRtbCharIndex which is more interested in members of the type: RichTextBoxPrinter

Insufficient Modularization,NExtra.WinForms.Tests.Extensions,DataGridViewExtensionsBehvaior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielsaidi_nextra\NExtra.WinForms.Tests\Extensions\DataGridViewExtensionsBehvaior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
