Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,champ,Champ,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\Champ.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,champ,ChampTemplateBase<TModel>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\ChampTemplateBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Model
Unnecessary Abstraction,champ,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' STATIC_CONTENT' TEMPLATES' OUTPUT' PAGES
Unutilized Abstraction,champ,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,champ,SiteBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\SiteBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: DirectoryNode' PageNode (in method "ProcessPages" of class "SiteBuilder").
Broken Modularization,champ,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Source' Destination' DefaultTemplate' Bootstrap' BootstrapSource' Watch' Help' EnableVerboseLogging' HelpText
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,champ,ChampTemplateBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\ChampTemplateBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: champ.ChampTemplateBase' champ.SiteBuilder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,champ,PageListCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\PageListCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: champ.PageListCollection' champ.Map.Node' champ.Map.PageNode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,champ,PageList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\PageList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: champ.PageList' champ.PageListCollection' champ.Map.Node' champ.Map.PageNode
Broken Hierarchy,champ,ChampTemplateBase<TModel>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\ChampTemplateBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): champ.ChampTemplateBase
Broken Hierarchy,champ.Map,PageNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\Map\PageNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): champ.Map.Node
Broken Hierarchy,champ.Map,SyndicationNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_champ\Map\SyndicationNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): champ.Map.Node
