Unutilized Abstraction,Cocktail,AwaiterFns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\AwaiterFns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cocktail,Compatibility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\Compatibility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cocktail,OperationFns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationFns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Cocktail,OperationFns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationFns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OperationFns (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationFns.cs' [240' 265])' OperationFns (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationFns.cs' [273' 298])
Unutilized Abstraction,Cocktail,TaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail,Compatibility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\Compatibility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail,Compatibility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\Compatibility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail,OperationFns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationFns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cocktail,OperationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cocktail.OperationResult' Cocktail.OperationResult<T>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cocktail,OperationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cocktail.OperationResult' Cocktail.OperationResult<T>' Cocktail.SynchronousOperationResult<T>
Wide Hierarchy,Cocktail,OperationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Cocktail.OperationResult<T>' Cocktail.CoroutineOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.EntityQueryOperationResult' Cocktail.EntityQueryOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.EntityRefetchOperationResult' Cocktail.EntitySaveOperationResult' Cocktail.EntityScalarQueryOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.InvokeServerMethodOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.SynchronousOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.PageOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.TaskOperationResult' Cocktail.TaskOperationResult<T>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Cocktail,OperationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: OperationResult<T>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Cocktail,OperationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SynchronousOperationResult<T>
Multipath Hierarchy,Cocktail,OperationResult<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IAwaitable
Broken Hierarchy,Cocktail,TaskOperationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cocktail.OperationResult
