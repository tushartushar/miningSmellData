Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail,Compatibility,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\Compatibility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail,Compatibility,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\Compatibility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail,OperationFns,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationFns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Wide Hierarchy,Cocktail,OperationResult,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Cocktail.OperationResult<T>' Cocktail.CoroutineOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.EntityQueryOperationResult' Cocktail.EntityQueryOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.EntityRefetchOperationResult' Cocktail.EntitySaveOperationResult' Cocktail.EntityScalarQueryOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.InvokeServerMethodOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.SynchronousOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.PageOperationResult<T>' Cocktail.TaskOperationResult' Cocktail.TaskOperationResult<T>
Multipath Hierarchy,Cocktail,OperationResult<T>,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IAwaitable
Broken Hierarchy,Cocktail,CoroutineOperationResult<T>,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cocktail.OperationResult
Broken Hierarchy,Cocktail,EntityQueryOperationResult,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cocktail.OperationResult
Broken Hierarchy,Cocktail,EntityQueryOperationResult<T>,C:\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Cocktail.Compat\OperationResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cocktail.OperationResult
