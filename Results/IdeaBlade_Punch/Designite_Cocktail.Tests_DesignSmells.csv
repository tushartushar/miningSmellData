Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: QueryingRaised' QueriedRaised' FetchingRaised' SavingRaised' SavedRaised' EntityChangingRaised' EntityChangedRaised' ClearedRaised
Insufficient Modularization,Cocktail.Tests,UnitOfWork,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Test Projects\Cocktail.Tests\UnitOfWork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,Cocktail.Tests,CompositionUnitTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Test Projects\Cocktail.Tests\CompositionUnitTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CompositionUnitTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Test Projects\Cocktail.Tests\CompositionUnitTests.cs' [1' 29])' OnlineUnitTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Test Projects\Cocktail.Tests\OnlineUnitTests.cs' [1' 29])
Broken Hierarchy,Cocktail.Tests,CompositionUnitTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IdeaBlade_Punch\Test Projects\Cocktail.Tests\CompositionUnitTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Cocktail.Tests.Helpers.CocktailTestBase
