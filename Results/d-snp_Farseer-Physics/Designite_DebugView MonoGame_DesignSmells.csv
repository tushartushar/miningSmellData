Unutilized Abstraction,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DrawPolygon which is more interested in members of the type: PrimitiveBatch
Feature Envy,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DrawSolidPolygon which is more interested in members of the type: PrimitiveBatch
Feature Envy,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DrawSegment which is more interested in members of the type: PrimitiveBatch
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,ContactPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Normal' Position' State
Deficient Encapsulation,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultShapeColor' InactiveShapeColor' KinematicShapeColor' SleepingShapeColor' StaticShapeColor' TextColor' DebugPanelPosition' AdaptiveLimits' ValuesToGraph' MinimumValue' MaximumValue' PerformancePanelBounds' Enabled
Deficient Encapsulation,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,ContactPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Normal' Position' State
Deficient Encapsulation,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,StringData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Color' Text' Position
Insufficient Modularization,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FarseerPhysics.DebugView,DebugViewXNA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\DebugViews\DebugView XNA\DebugViewXNA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
