Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,FarseerPhysics,Game,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\Game.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarseerPhysics,GameTime,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\GameTime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GameStartTime' FrameStartTime' ElapsedGameTime' TotalGameTime
Unutilized Abstraction,FarseerPhysics,MainPage,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FarseerPhysics.DemoShare,Border,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\DemoShare\Border.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FirstRun
Deficient Encapsulation,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,MenuItem,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\MenuItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsExitItem' Screen
Deficient Encapsulation,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,ScreenManager,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\ScreenManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MainMenuScreen
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarseerPhysics,DrawableGameComponent,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\DrawableGameComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DrawableGameComponent' Game
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' MenuItem' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,GameScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\GameScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameScreen' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager' MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,MainMenuScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\MainMenuScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainMenuScreen' ScreenManager
Broken Hierarchy,FarseerPhysics,FarseerPhysicsGame,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\FarseerPhysicsGame.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Game
Rebellious Hierarchy,FarseerPhysics.ScreenSystem,MenuScreen,F:\newReposMay17\d-snp_Farseer-Physics\Samples\Samples Silverlight\ScreenSystem\MenuScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LoadContent
