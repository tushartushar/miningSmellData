Unutilized Abstraction,Minimatch,Minimatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SLaks_Minimatch\Minimatch\Minimatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Minimatch,PatternListEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SLaks_Minimatch\Minimatch\Minimatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Start' ReStart
Broken Modularization,Minimatch,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SLaks_Minimatch\Minimatch\Minimatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NoComment' NoNegate' NoBrace' NoGlobStar' NoCase' NoExt' Dot' NoNull' FlipNegate' MatchBase' RegexOptions' AllowWindowsPaths' IgnoreCase
Insufficient Modularization,Minimatch,Minimatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SLaks_Minimatch\Minimatch\Minimatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Rebellious Hierarchy,Minimatch,GlobStar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SLaks_Minimatch\Minimatch\Minimatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Match
