God Component,DemoInfo,DemoInfo,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 60
Feature Concentration,DemoInfo,DemoInfo,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DemoParser' RoundEndedEventArgs' RoundMVPEventArgs' RoundStartedEventArgs' PlayerTeamEventArgs' PlayerKilledEventArgs' BotTakeOverEventArgs' WeaponFiredEventArgs' FireEventArgs' SmokeEventArgs' DecoyEventArgs' FlashEventArgs' GrenadeEventArgs' BombEventArgs' BombDefuseEventArgs' PlayerHurtEventArgs' PlayerBindEventArgs' PlayerDisconnectEventArgs' SayTextEventArgs' SayText2EventArgs' RankUpdateEventArgs' Equipment' EquipmentElement' EquipmentClass' Player' Team' DemoHeader' Vector' Split' CommandInfo' PlayerInfo' BoundingBoxInformation' DemoCommand' RoundEndReason' RoundMVPReason' Hitgroup' BitStreamUtil' IBitStream' NETTick' PacketEntities' GameEventList' GameEvent' CreateStringTable' UpdateStringTable' SendTable' AdditionalPlayerInformation' HeaderParsedEventArgs' NadeEventArgs' QAngle]' [TickDoneEventArgs]' [MatchStartedEventArgs]' [RoundAnnounceMatchStartedEventArgs]' [RoundOfficiallyEndedEventArgs]' [WinPanelMatchEventArgs]' [RoundFinalEventArgs]' [LastRoundHalfEventArgs]' [FreezetimeEndedEventArgs]' [Helper]' [Program]' [LimitStream]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.2
Scattered Functionality,DemoInfo,DemoInfo,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: DemoInfo.DT' DemoInfo.DP
