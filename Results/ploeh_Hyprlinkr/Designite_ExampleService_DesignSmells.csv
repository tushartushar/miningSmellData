Unnecessary Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,AtomLinkModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\AtomLinkModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Href' Rel
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,HomeModelCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\HomeModelCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Links' Homes
Unutilized Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,MvcApplication,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,HomeModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\HomeModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Links' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,NoDIModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\NoDIModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Links' Name
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,HomeController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\HomeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService.HomeController' Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService.NoDIController
