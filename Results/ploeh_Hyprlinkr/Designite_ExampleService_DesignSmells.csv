Unnecessary Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,AtomLinkModel,C:\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\AtomLinkModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Href' Rel
Unutilized Abstraction,Ploeh.Samples.Hyprlinkr.ExampleService,AtomLinkModel,C:\repos\ploeh_Hyprlinkr\ExampleService\AtomLinkModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
