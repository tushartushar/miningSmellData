Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,MediaInfoWrapper,MediaInfoWrapper,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MediaInfoWrapper' MediaInfoParser' StreamKind' MediaInfoDLL' LoadLibraryFlags' InfoKind]' [InfoOptions]' [InfoFileOptions]' [Status]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44,MediaInfoWrapper.InfoOptions' MediaInfoWrapper.InfoFileOptions' MediaInfoWrapper.Status,MediaInfoWrapper.MediaInfoWrapper' MediaInfoWrapper.StreamKind' MediaInfoWrapper.InfoKind' MediaInfoWrapper.InfoOptions' MediaInfoWrapper.InfoFileOptions' MediaInfoWrapper.Status' MediaInfoWrapper.MediaInfoDLL' MediaInfoWrapper.LoadLibraryFlags' MediaInfoWrapper.MediaInfoParser
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.92  All the dependencies among components: from: Shoko.Server' to: Shoko.Server.Settings' from: Shoko.Server' to: AniDBAPI' from: Shoko.Server' to: AniDBAPI.Commands' from:
