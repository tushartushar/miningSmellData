Unutilized Abstraction,EngineTests.Blocks,BlockStorageTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_voxeliq\contrib\old-codebase\src\Tests\Blocks\BlockStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EngineTests.Blocks,BlockTestExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_voxeliq\contrib\old-codebase\src\Tests\Blocks\BlockStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,EngineTests.Blocks,BlockTypeTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_voxeliq\contrib\old-codebase\src\Tests\Blocks\BlockTypeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestEmptyBlock which is more interested in members of the type: Block
