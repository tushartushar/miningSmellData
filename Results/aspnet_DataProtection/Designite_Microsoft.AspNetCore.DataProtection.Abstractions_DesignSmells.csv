Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection,DataProtectionCommonExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_DataProtection\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Abstractions\DataProtectionCommonExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection,EncodingUtil,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_DataProtection\shared\EncodingUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SecureUtf8Encoding
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection,ExceptionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_DataProtection\shared\ExceptionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Infrastructure,IApplicationDiscriminator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_DataProtection\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Abstractions\Infrastructure\IApplicationDiscriminator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Discriminator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection,IDataProtectionProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_DataProtection\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Abstractions\IDataProtectionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.IDataProtectionProvider' Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.IDataProtector
Cyclic Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection,IDataProtectionProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_DataProtection\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Abstractions\IDataProtectionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IDataProtector
