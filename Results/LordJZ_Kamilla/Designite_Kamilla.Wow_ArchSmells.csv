Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Ambiguous Interface,Kamilla.Wow,Kamilla.Network.Logging.Wow,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: MangosNetworkLog
Ambiguous Interface,Kamilla.Wow,Kamilla.Network.Protocols.Wow,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: WowPacket
Feature Concentration,Kamilla.Wow,Kamilla.Network.Protocols.Wow,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Classes]' [ClassMask]' [CultureInfoExtensions' WowLocales]' [Expansions]' [Genders]' [RaceMask]' [Races]' [SpecialWowOpcodes]' [StreamHandlerExtensions]' [VectorPackingExtensions]' [WowPacket' WowPacketFlags]' [WowStrings]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.86
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.43  All the dependencies among components: from: Kamilla.Network.Logging.Wow' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols.Wow' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging.Wow' to: Kamilla.Network.Logging' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging.Wow' to: Kamilla.Network' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging.Wow' to: Kamilla.IO' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging.Wow' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols.Wow' to: Kamilla.IO' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols.Wow' to: Kamilla' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols.Wow' to: Kamilla.Network' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.WPF' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.Network' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.Network.Logging' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing.Plugins' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: NetworkLogViewer.ViewTabs' from: NetworkLogViewer' to: Kamilla.IO' from: NetworkLogViewer.ViewTabs' to: NetworkLogViewer' from: NetworkLogViewer.ViewTabs' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' from: NetworkLogViewer.ViewTabs' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' from: NetworkLogViewer.ViewTabs' to: Kamilla.Network' from: NetworkLogViewer.ViewTabs' to: Kamilla.WPF' from: Kamilla.IO' to: Kamilla' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging' to: Kamilla.IO' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging' to: Kamilla.Network' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging' to: Kamilla' from: Kamilla.Network.Logging' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' from: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' from: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' to: Kamilla.IO' from: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' to: Kamilla.Network' from: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' to: Kamilla.Network.Logging' from: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' to: Kamilla.Network' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' to: Kamilla' from: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' to: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' to: Kamilla.Network.Logging' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' to: Kamilla.Network.Protocols' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' to: Kamilla.Network.Parsing' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing.Plugins' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' to: Kamilla.Network' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing.Plugins' to: Kamilla.Network.Viewing' from: Kamilla.Network.Viewing.Plugins' to: Kamilla' from: Kamilla.WPF' to: Kamilla.
