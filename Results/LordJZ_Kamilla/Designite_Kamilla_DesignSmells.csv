Missing Hierarchy,Kamilla.Network.Logging,NetworkLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LordJZ_Kamilla\Kamilla\Network\Logging\NetworkLog.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IHasStartTicks' IHasStartTime (in method "NetworkLog" of class "NetworkLog").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Kamilla.Network.Parsing,UndefinedPacketParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LordJZ_Kamilla\Kamilla\Network\Parsing\UndefinedPacketParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: InternalParse
Cyclic Hierarchy,Kamilla.Network.Parsing,PacketParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LordJZ_Kamilla\Kamilla\Network\Parsing\PacketParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: UndefinedPacketParser
