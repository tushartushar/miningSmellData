Unnecessary Abstraction,LoggingExtensions.Tests.Performance,Log4NetPerformanceSpecs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferventcoder_this.Log\LoggingExtensions.Tests\Performance\Log4NetPerformanceSpecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,LoggingExtensions.Tests.Performance,Log4NetPerformanceSpecs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferventcoder_this.Log\LoggingExtensions.Tests\Performance\Log4NetPerformanceSpecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
