Duplicate Abstraction,Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests,LocalizedViewsRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgauffin_griffin.mvccontrib\source\Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests\LocalizedViewsRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  LocalizedViewsRepositoryTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgauffin_griffin.mvccontrib\source\Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests\LocalizedViewsRepositoryTests.cs' [11' 34])' LocalizedTypesRepositoryTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgauffin_griffin.mvccontrib\source\Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests\LocalizedTypesRepositoryTests.cs' [10' 33])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests,TestType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgauffin_griffin.mvccontrib\source\Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests\TestType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstName

Feature Envy,Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests,LocalizedTypesRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgauffin_griffin.mvccontrib\source\Griffin.MvcContrib.SqlServer.Tests\LocalizedTypesRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetExisting which is more interested in members of the type: SqlLocalizedTypesRepository
