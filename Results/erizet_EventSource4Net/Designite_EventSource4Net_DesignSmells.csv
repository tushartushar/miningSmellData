Imperative Abstraction,EventSource4Net,ConnectedState,F:\newReposMay17\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net\ConnectedState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unutilized Abstraction,EventSource4Net,ServerSentEventReceivedEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net\ServerSentEventReceivedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EventSource4Net,StateChangedEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net\StateChangedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EventSource4Net,Watchdog,F:\newReposMay17\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net\WatchDog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EventSource4Net,ConnectedState,F:\newReposMay17\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net\ConnectedState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ConnectedState' ConnectingState' DisconnectedState
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EventSource4Net,ConnectedState,F:\newReposMay17\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net\ConnectedState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ConnectedState' ConnectingState' DisconnectedState' ConnectingState' DisconnectedState
