Unutilized Abstraction,EventSource4Net.Test,MessagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\MessagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EventSource4Net.Test,EventSourceTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\EventSourceTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EventSource4Net.Test,TestExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\TestExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,EventSource4Net.Test,WebRequesterMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\WebRequesterFactoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GetCalled
Deficient Encapsulation,EventSource4Net.Test,ServiceResponseMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\WebRequesterFactoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StatusCodeCalled
Broken Hierarchy,EventSource4Net.Test,TestableEventSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\TestableEventSource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EventSource4Net.EventSource
Rebellious Hierarchy,EventSource4Net.Test,TestableStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erizet_EventSource4Net\EventSource4Net.Test\WebRequesterFactoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength
