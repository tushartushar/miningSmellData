Unutilized Abstraction,RVIO,Error,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RVIO,unix,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsUnix
Unutilized Abstraction,RVIO,DirectoryInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RVIO,Directory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RVIO,File,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,RVIO,FileInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' FullName' LastWriteTime' Length
Deficient Encapsulation,RVIO,DirectoryInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\RVIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' FullName' LastWriteTime
Broken Modularization,RVIO,WIN32_FIND_DATA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\Win32Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwFileAttributes' ftCreationTimeLow' ftCreationTimeHigh' ftLastAccessTimeLow' ftLastAccessTimeHigh' ftLastWriteTimeLow' ftLastWriteTimeHigh' nFileSizeHigh' nFileSizeLow' dwReserved0' dwReserved1' cFileName' cAlternateFileName
Broken Modularization,RVIO,WIN32_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DATA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\Win32Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' fileAttributes' ftCreationTimeLow' ftCreationTimeHigh' ftLastAccessTimeLow' ftLastAccessTimeHigh' ftLastWriteTimeLow' ftLastWriteTimeHigh' fileSizeHigh' fileSizeLow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RVIO,Win32Native,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gjefferyes_RomVault\RVIO\Win32Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RVIO.Win32Native' RVIO.SafeFindHandle
