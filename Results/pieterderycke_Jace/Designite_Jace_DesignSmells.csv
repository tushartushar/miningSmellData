Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Jace,AstBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\AstBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Build
Unnecessary Abstraction,Jace.Execution,ParameterInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\ParameterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' DataType
Unnecessary Abstraction,Jace.Tokenizer,Token,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Tokenizer\Token.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' StartPosition' Length' TokenType' Value
Imperative Abstraction,Jace.Tokenizer,TokenReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Tokenizer\TokenReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Read
Imperative Abstraction,Jace.Util,FuncAdapter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\FuncAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Wrap
Unutilized Abstraction,Jace.Util,FuncAdapterArguments,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\FuncAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Jace.Util,TypeExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Jace.Execution,ParameterInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\ParameterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' DataType
Deficient Encapsulation,Jace.Tokenizer,Token,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Tokenizer\Token.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StartPosition' Length' TokenType' Value
Insufficient Modularization,Jace,CalculationEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\CalculationEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Jace,CalculationEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\CalculationEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Jace,CalculationEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\CalculationEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Jace.CalculationEngine' Jace.Execution.FormulaBuilder
Wide Hierarchy,Jace.Operations,Operation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Operations\Operation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Jace.Operations.Addition' Jace.Operations.And' Jace.Operations.Constant<T>' Jace.Operations.Division' Jace.Operations.Equal' Jace.Operations.Exponentiation' Jace.Operations.Function' Jace.Operations.GreaterOrEqualThan' Jace.Operations.GreaterThan' Jace.Operations.LessOrEqualThan' Jace.Operations.LessThan' Jace.Operations.Modulo' Jace.Operations.Multiplication' Jace.Operations.NotEqual' Jace.Operations.Or' Jace.Operations.Subtraction' Jace.Operations.UnaryMinus' Jace.Operations.Variable
