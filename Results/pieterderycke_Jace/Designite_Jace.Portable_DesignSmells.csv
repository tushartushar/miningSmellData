Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Jace,AstBuilder,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\AstBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Build
Unutilized Abstraction,Jace,ParseException,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\ParseException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Jace.Execution,DynamicCompiler,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\DynamicCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DynamicCompiler (C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\DynamicCompiler.cs' [14' 41])' DynamicCompiler (C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\DynamicCompiler.cs' [304' 331])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Jace.Execution,ParameterInfo,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\ParameterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' DataType
Unnecessary Abstraction,Jace.Tokenizer,Token,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Tokenizer\Token.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' StartPosition' Length' TokenType' Value
Imperative Abstraction,Jace.Tokenizer,TokenReader,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Tokenizer\TokenReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Read
Imperative Abstraction,Jace.Util,FuncAdapter,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\FuncAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Wrap
Unutilized Abstraction,Jace.Util,FuncAdapterArguments,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\FuncAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Jace.Util,MemoryCache<TKey;TValue>,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\MemoryCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Jace.Util,TypeExtensions,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Util\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Jace.Execution,ParameterInfo,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\ParameterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' DataType
Deficient Encapsulation,Jace.Tokenizer,Token,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Tokenizer\Token.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StartPosition' Length' TokenType' Value
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Jace,CalculationEngine,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\CalculationEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Jace.CalculationEngine' Jace.Execution.FormulaBuilder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Jace.Execution,FormulaBuilder,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Execution\FormulaBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Jace.Execution.FormulaBuilder' Jace.CalculationEngine
Wide Hierarchy,Jace.Operations,Operation,C:\repos\pieterderycke_Jace\Jace\Operations\Operation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Jace.Operations.Addition' Jace.Operations.Constant<T>' Jace.Operations.Division' Jace.Operations.Equal' Jace.Operations.Exponentiation' Jace.Operations.Function' Jace.Operations.GreaterOrEqualThan' Jace.Operations.GreaterThan' Jace.Operations.LessOrEqualThan' Jace.Operations.LessThan' Jace.Operations.Modulo' Jace.Operations.Multiplication' Jace.Operations.NotEqual' Jace.Operations.Subtraction' Jace.Operations.UnaryMinus' Jace.Operations.Variable
