Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,IsoMounter.Configuration,PluginConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaBrowser_MediaBrowser.IsoMounting\IsoMounter\Configuration\PluginConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,IsoMounter,LinuxIsoManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaBrowser_MediaBrowser.IsoMounting\IsoMounter\LinuxIsoManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  LinuxIsoManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaBrowser_MediaBrowser.IsoMounting\IsoMounter\LinuxIsoManager.cs' [187' 209])' LinuxMount (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaBrowser_MediaBrowser.IsoMounting\IsoMounter\LinuxMount.cs' [47' 69])
Unutilized Abstraction,IsoMounter,Plugin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaBrowser_MediaBrowser.IsoMounting\IsoMounter\Plugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IsoMounter,LinuxIsoManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaBrowser_MediaBrowser.IsoMounting\IsoMounter\LinuxIsoManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IsoMounter.LinuxIsoManager' IsoMounter.LinuxMount
