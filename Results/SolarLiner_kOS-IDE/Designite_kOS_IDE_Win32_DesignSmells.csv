Unnecessary Abstraction,kOS_IDE.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SolarLiner_kOS-IDE\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' lo' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,kOS_IDE,Psswd,C:\repos\SolarLiner_kOS-IDE\GlobalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MD5hash' CharsCount' Ready
Deficient Encapsulation,kOS_IDE,AppOptions,C:\repos\SolarLiner_kOS-IDE\GlobalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: KSPfolder' Zoom' SmartIndent
Deficient Encapsulation,kOS_IDE,AppOptions,C:\repos\SolarLiner_kOS-IDE\GlobalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: KSPfolder' Zoom' SmartIndent
Insufficient Modularization,kOS_IDE,TextEditor,C:\repos\SolarLiner_kOS-IDE\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
