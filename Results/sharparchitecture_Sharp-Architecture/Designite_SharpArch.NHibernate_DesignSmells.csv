(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SharpArch.NHibernate,NHibernateRepositoryWithTypedId<T;TId>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharparchitecture_Sharp-Architecture\Src\SharpArch.NHibernate\NHibernateRepositoryWithTypedId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpArch.NHibernate,NHibernateRepositoryWithTypedId<T;TId>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharparchitecture_Sharp-Architecture\Src\SharpArch.NHibernate\NHibernateRepositoryWithTypedId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpArch.NHibernate,TransactionManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharparchitecture_Sharp-Architecture\Src\SharpArch.NHibernate\TransactionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FlushChanges
