Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,Issue,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\Issue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Tenant' Product' Id
Unutilized Abstraction,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,Issue,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\Issue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,ProductView,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\ProductView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' TenantId
Unnecessary Abstraction,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain,IssueView,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\IssueView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' Assigner' Name' Id
Deficient Encapsulation,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain,IssueView,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\IssueView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Id
Broken Hierarchy,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,IssueAssignerId,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\IssueAssignerId.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model.GenericId
Broken Hierarchy,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,IssueId,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\IssueId.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model.GenericId
Broken Hierarchy,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,ProductId,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\ProductId.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model.GenericId
Broken Hierarchy,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,TenantId,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\Tenant.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model.GenericId
Rebellious Hierarchy,SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain.Model,IssueState,C:\repos\ToJans_SaasOvation\SaasOvation.IssueTrack.Domain\Model\IssueState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: IssueClosed
