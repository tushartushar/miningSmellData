Unutilized Abstraction,TinyIoC,AssemblyExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,TinyIoC,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetGenericMethod
Unutilized Abstraction,TinyIoC,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TinyIoC,ReverseTypeExtender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TinyIoC,TinyIoCConstructorAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TinyIoC,TinyIoCAspNetExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoCAspNetExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TinyMessenger,ITinyMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyMessenger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Sender
Unutilized Abstraction,TinyMessenger,TinyMessengerSubscriptionException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyMessenger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,TinyIoC,ResolveOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UnregisteredResolutionAction' NamedResolutionFailureAction' Default' FailNameNotFoundOnly' FailUnregisteredAndNameNotFound' FailUnregisteredOnly' _Default' _FailUnregisteredAndNameNotFound' _FailUnregisteredOnly' _FailNameNotFoundOnly' _UnregisteredResolutionAction' _NamedResolutionFailureAction
Insufficient Modularization,TinyIoC,TinyIoCContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 90 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TinyIoC,TinyIoCContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 121 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TinyIoC,TinyIoCContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 208
Rebellious Hierarchy,TinyIoC,DelegateFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetConstructor
Rebellious Hierarchy,TinyIoC,WeakDelegateFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetConstructor
Rebellious Hierarchy,TinyIoC,InstanceFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetConstructor
Rebellious Hierarchy,TinyIoC,WeakInstanceFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grumpydev_TinyIoC\src\TinyIoC\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
