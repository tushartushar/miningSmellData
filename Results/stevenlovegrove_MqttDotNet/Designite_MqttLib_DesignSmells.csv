Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MqttLib,IMqtt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\IMqtt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResendInterval
Feature Envy,MqttLib,Mqtt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Mqtt.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Subscribe which is more interested in members of the type: StreamManager
Feature Envy,MqttLib,Mqtt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Mqtt.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MqttLib,MqttClientFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\MqttClientFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MqttLib.Core.Messages,MqttMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\Messages\MqttMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Serialise
Imperative Abstraction,MqttLib.Core,StreamFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\StreamFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateStream
Unexploited Encapsulation,MqttLib.Core,QoSManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\QoSManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MqttAcknowledgeMessage' MqttPubrecMessage' MqttPubrelMessage (in method "ProcessReceivedMessage" of class "QoSManager").
Unexploited Encapsulation,MqttLib.Core,QoSManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\QoSManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MqttPubcompMessage' MqttPublishMessage (in method "ProcessReceivedMessage" of class "QoSManager").
Deficient Encapsulation,MqttLib.Core,StreamFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\StreamFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BROKER_SERVICE
Deficient Encapsulation,MqttLib.Core,StreamFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\StreamFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: BROKER_SERVICE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MqttLib.Core,QoSManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\QoSManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MqttLib.Core.QoSManager' MqttLib.Core.StreamManager
Broken Hierarchy,MqttLib.Core.Messages,MqttAcknowledgeMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\Messages\MqttAcknowledgeMessage.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttMessage
Rebellious Hierarchy,MqttLib.Core.Messages,MqttConnectMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\Messages\MqttConnectMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ConstructFromStream
Rebellious Hierarchy,MqttLib.Core.Messages,MqttDisconnectMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\Messages\MqttDisconnectMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SendPayload' ConstructFromStream
Wide Hierarchy,MqttLib.Core.Messages,MqttMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\Messages\MqttMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttAcknowledgeMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttConnackMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttConnectMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttDisconnectMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttPingReqMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttPingRespMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttPubcompMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttPublishMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttPubrecMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttPubrelMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttSubscribeMessage' MqttLib.Core.Messages.MqttUnsubscribeMessage
Rebellious Hierarchy,MqttLib.Core.Messages,MqttPingReqMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevenlovegrove_MqttDotNet\MqttLib\Core\Messages\MqttPingReqMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
