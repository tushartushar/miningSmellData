Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,Actions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\Actions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BreakSession' ThrottleTableRequest' ThrottleBlobQueueRequest' TableErrorPayload' StorageErrorPayload
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,Actions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\Actions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,BlobBehaviors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\BlobBehaviors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,BlobBehaviors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\BlobBehaviors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,StorageConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\StorageConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BlobBaseDnsName' QueueBaseDnsName' TableBaseDnsName' FileBaseDnsName
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,AzureStorageSelectors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\AzureStorageSelectors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,Actions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\Actions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BreakSession' ThrottleTableRequest' ThrottleBlobQueueRequest' TableErrorPayload' StorageErrorPayload
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,Actions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\Actions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: BreakSession' ThrottleTableRequest' ThrottleBlobQueueRequest' TableErrorPayload' StorageErrorPayload
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.Azure.Test.Network,Actions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-storage-net\Test\FaultInjection\AzureStorageMangler\Actions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BreakSession' ThrottleTableRequest' ThrottleBlobQueueRequest' TableErrorPayload' StorageErrorPayload
