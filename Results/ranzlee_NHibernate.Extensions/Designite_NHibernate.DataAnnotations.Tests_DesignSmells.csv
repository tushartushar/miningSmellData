Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests.Model,Pet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\Model\Pet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Gender' NameLengthValidation' TooManyKittens
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests,When_using_session_auditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\When_using_session_auditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests,When_using_session_auditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\When_using_session_auditor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_validate_a_simple_property which is more interested in members of the type: Marshaler
Feature Envy,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests,When_using_session_auditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\When_using_session_auditor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: IValidatableObject__is_invoked which is more interested in members of the type: Marshaler
Feature Envy,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests,When_using_session_auditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\When_using_session_auditor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: A_persistence_context_is_provided_to_IValidatableObject which is more interested in members of the type: Marshaler
Feature Envy,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests,When_using_session_auditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\When_using_session_auditor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Validation_can_be_cascaded_to_entity_components which is more interested in members of the type: Marshaler
Feature Envy,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests,When_using_session_auditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\When_using_session_auditor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_persist_a_cat_hierarchy which is more interested in members of the type: Marshaler
Broken Modularization,NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests.Model,Pet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DataAnnotations.Tests\Model\Pet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Gender' NameLengthValidation' TooManyKittens
