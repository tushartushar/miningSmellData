Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,NHibernate.DependencyInjection,NHibernate.DependencyInjection,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: NHibernate.DependencyInjection' NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Core
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.DependencyInjection,NHibernate.DependencyInjection,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Core
Feature Concentration,NHibernate.DependencyInjection,NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DefaultArgumentHandler]' [DefaultMethodEmitter]' [DefaultProxyFactory' DefaultProxyFactoryFactory' DynProxyTypeValidator' ProxyFactory' ProxyFactoryFactory' ProxyImplementor]' [DefaultyProxyMethodBuilder]' [ReflectionOptimizer]' [DefaultEntityInjector]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.55
