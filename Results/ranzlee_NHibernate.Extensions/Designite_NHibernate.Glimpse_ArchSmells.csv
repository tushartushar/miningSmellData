Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,NHibernate.Glimpse,NHibernate.Glimpse.InternalLoggers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: NHibernate.Glimpse.InternalLoggers' NHibernate.Glimpse
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Glimpse,NHibernate.Glimpse,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Glimpse.InternalLoggers
Feature Concentration,NHibernate.Glimpse,NHibernate.Glimpse.InternalLoggers,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BatcherInternalLogger]' [ConnectionInternalLogger]' [FlushInternalLogger]' [LoadInternalLogger]' [SessionInternalLogger]' [TransactionInternalLogger]' [NoLogger]' [SqlInternalLogger]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
Scattered Functionality,NHibernate.Glimpse,NHibernate.Glimpse.InternalLoggers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: NHibernate.Glimpse' NHibernate.Glimpse.Core
