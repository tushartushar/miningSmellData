Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Tests,When_using_custom_bytecode_provider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Tests\When_using_custom_bytecode_provider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Tests.Model,BasicCat,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ranzlee_NHibernate.Extensions\NHibernate.DependencyInjection.Tests\Model\BasicCat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Kittens' Parent' _kittens
