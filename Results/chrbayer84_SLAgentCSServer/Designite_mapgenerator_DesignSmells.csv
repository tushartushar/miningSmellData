Duplicate Abstraction,mapgenerator,mapgenerator,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\mapgenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: mapgenerator[531' 572]' mapgenerator[590' 631]
Duplicate Abstraction,libsecondlife,PacketFrequency,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\ProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PacketFrequency[91' 112]' PacketFrequency[132' 153]
Deficient Encapsulation,libsecondlife,MapField,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\ProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: KeywordPosition' Name' Type' Count
Deficient Encapsulation,libsecondlife,MapBlock,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\ProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: KeywordPosition' Name' Count' Fields
Deficient Encapsulation,libsecondlife,MapPacket,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\ProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ID' Name' Frequency' Trusted' Encoded' Blocks
Deficient Encapsulation,libsecondlife,ProtocolManager,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\ProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.

Insufficient Modularization,mapgenerator,mapgenerator,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\mapgenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 313
Broken Modularization,libsecondlife,MapPacket,C:\repos\chrbayer84_SLAgentCSServer\libsecondlife-0.5.0\libsecondlife\mapgenerator\ProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ID' Name' Frequency' Trusted' Encoded' Blocks
