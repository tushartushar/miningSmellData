Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,NHibernate.Spatial,NHibernate.Spatial.Criterion,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: NHibernate.Spatial.Criterion' NHibernate.Spatial.Criterion.Lambda
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Spatial,NHibernate.Spatial.Criterion.Lambda,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Spatial.Criterion
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Spatial,NHibernate.Spatial.Metadata,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Spatial.Dialect
God Component,NHibernate.Spatial,NHibernate.Spatial.Linq.Functions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 51
Feature Concentration,NHibernate.Spatial,NHibernate.Spatial.Criterion,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SpatialProjections]' [SpatialRelateProjection' SpatialProjection' SpatialTransformProjection' SpatialRelationProjection' SpatialValidationProjection' SpatialAnalysisProjection' SpatialAggregateProjection]' [SpatialFilterCriterion' SpatialRestrictions' SpatialRelationCriterion' SpatialValidationCriterion' SpatialExpression]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.23
Feature Concentration,NHibernate.Spatial,NHibernate.Spatial.Dialect.Function,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConstantValueFunction]' [SpatialAnalysisFunction' SpatialStandardSafeFunction' SpatialValidationFunction' SpatialPropertyFunction' SpatialStandardFunction' SpatialMethodFunction' SpatialMethodSafeFunction' SpatialRelationFunction]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22
