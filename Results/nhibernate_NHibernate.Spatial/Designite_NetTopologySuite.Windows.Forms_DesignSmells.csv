Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,FontGlyphReader,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\FontGlyphReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath[1' 33]' IdentityPointTransformation[1' 33]' IPointTransformation[1' 33]' IPointShapeFactory[1' 33]' GraphicsPathWriter[1' 33]
Duplicate Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath[1' 34]' IPointTransformation[1' 34]' IPointShapeFactory[1' 34]' GraphicsPathWriter[1' 34]
Duplicate Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath[1' 35]' GraphicsPathWriter[1' 35]' IPointTransformation[1' 35]' IPointShapeFactory[1' 35]
Imperative Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GraphicsPathWriter,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GraphicsPathWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToShape
Unutilized Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GraphicsPathWriter,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GraphicsPathWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,BasePointShapeFactory,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultSize
Deficient Encapsulation,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,BasePointShapeFactory,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultSize
Broken Hierarchy,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,Dot,D:\newReposJune17\nhibernate_NHibernate.Spatial\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Square
