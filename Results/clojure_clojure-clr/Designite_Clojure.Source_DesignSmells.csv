Unnecessary Abstraction,dm.interop,C4,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clojure_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Deficient Encapsulation,dm.interop,C1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clojure_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m1' m1s
Deficient Encapsulation,dm.interop,C1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\clojure_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: m1s
