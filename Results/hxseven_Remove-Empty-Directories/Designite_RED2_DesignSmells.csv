Unutilized Abstraction,RED2,WorkflowStepChangedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hxseven_Remove-Empty-Directories\RED2\Lib\Events.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,RED2,REDCore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hxseven_Remove-Empty-Directories\RED2\Lib\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SearchingForEmptyDirectories which is more interested in members of the type: FindEmptyDirectoryWorker
Deficient Encapsulation,RED2,RuntimeData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hxseven_Remove-Empty-Directories\RED2\Lib\RuntimeData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LogMessages' ProtectedFolderList
Deficient Encapsulation,RED2,REDCore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hxseven_Remove-Empty-Directories\RED2\Lib\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentProcessStep
Insufficient Modularization,RED2,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hxseven_Remove-Empty-Directories\RED2\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Broken Modularization,RED2.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hxseven_Remove-Empty-Directories\RED2\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
