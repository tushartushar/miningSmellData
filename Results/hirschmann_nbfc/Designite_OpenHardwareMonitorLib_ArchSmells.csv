Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,OpenHardwareMonitorLib,OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.Mainboard' OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.CPU' OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.RAM' OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.ATI' OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.TBalancer' OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.HDD
Unstable Dependency,OpenHardwareMonitorLib,OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.LPC,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware
God Component,OpenHardwareMonitorLib,OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 31
Scattered Functionality,OpenHardwareMonitorLib,OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.Mainboard,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware' OpenHardwareMonitor.Hardware.LPC
