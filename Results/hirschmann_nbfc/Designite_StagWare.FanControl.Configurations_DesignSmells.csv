Imperative Abstraction,StagWare.FanControl.Configurations,FanControlConfigV2,C:\repos\hirschmann_nbfc\Core\StagWare.Configurations\FanControlConfigV2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Clone
Unnecessary Abstraction,StagWare.FanControl.Configurations.Validation,Validation,C:\repos\hirschmann_nbfc\Core\StagWare.Configurations\Validation\Validation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RuleDescription' Result' Reason
Unnecessary Abstraction,StagWare.FanControl.Configurations.Validation,ValidationSummary<T>,C:\repos\hirschmann_nbfc\Core\StagWare.Configurations\Validation\ValidationSummary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Success' Passed' Warnings' Failed
Unutilized Abstraction,StagWare.FanControl.Configurations.Validation,ValidationSummary<T>,C:\repos\hirschmann_nbfc\Core\StagWare.Configurations\Validation\ValidationSummary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
