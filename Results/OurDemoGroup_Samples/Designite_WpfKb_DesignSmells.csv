(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenKey,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenKey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Imperative Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenKeyboard,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenKeyboard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: BeginInit
Unutilized Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenKeyboard,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenKeyboard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenKeypad,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenKeypad.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenWebKeyboard,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenWebKeyboard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: BeginInit
Unutilized Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenWebKeyboard,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenWebKeyboard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WpfKb.Controls,UniformOnScreenKeyboard,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\UniformOnScreenKeyboard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WpfKb.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexloited Encapsulation,WpfKb.Controls,OnScreenKey,C:\repos\OurDemoGroup_Samples\WPFTouchScreenKeyboard\WpfKb\Controls\OnScreenKey.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TogglingModifierKey' InstantaneousModifierKey (in method "AnimateMouseUp" of class "OnScreenKey").
