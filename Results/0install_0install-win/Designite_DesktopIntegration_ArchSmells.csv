Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,DesktopIntegration,ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.AccessPoints,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.AccessPoints' ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration
Unstable Dependency,DesktopIntegration,ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.AccessPoints,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration
Ambiguous Interface,DesktopIntegration,ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.ViewModel,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: IntegrationState
Feature Concentration,DesktopIntegration,ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.Unix,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AppAlias]' [ContextMenu]' [DefaultProgram]' [FileType]' [FreeDesktop]' [UrlProtocol]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
Feature Concentration,DesktopIntegration,ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.ViewModel,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AutoPlayModel' IconCapabilityModel' IntegrationState' UrlProtocolModel' CapabilityModel' ContextMenuModel' DefaultProgramModel' FileTypeModel]' [CapabilityModelExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22
Scattered Functionality,DesktopIntegration,ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.AccessPoints,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.Windows' ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.Unix
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.66  All the dependencies among components: from: ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.AccessPoints' to: ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration' from: ZeroInstall.DesktopIntegration.AccessPoints'
