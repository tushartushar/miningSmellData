Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa.AFD,Arista,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\AFD\Arista.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Nodo
Duplicate Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa.AFD,Nodo,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\AFD\Nodo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ERPolacaInversa.AFD.Nodo' ERPolacaInversa.Arbol.Nodo
Unnecessary Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa.Arbol,Hoja,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\Arbol\Hoja.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SigPos' Numero
Unutilized Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa,Extensions,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa,Form1,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Multifaceted Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa,FrmAFD,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\FrmAFD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Unnecessary Abstraction,ERPolacaInversa.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,ERPolacaInversa.AFD,Nodo,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\AFD\Nodo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Arreglo' Aristas' Type' X' Y
Broken Modularization,ERPolacaInversa.Arbol,Nodo,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\Arbol\Nodo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' EsAnulable' visitado' Padre' Izquierdo' Derecho' PrimeraPos' UltimaPos' X' Y
Insufficient Modularization,ERPolacaInversa,FrmAFD,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\FrmAFD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
Insufficient Modularization,ERPolacaInversa,RegularExpression,C:\repos\eamoreno_AFDCompi\ERPolacaInversa\ERPI\RegularExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 138
