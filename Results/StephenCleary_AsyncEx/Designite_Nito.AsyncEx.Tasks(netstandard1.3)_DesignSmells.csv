Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,SemaphoreSlimExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\SemaphoreSlimExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,SynchronizationContextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\SynchronizationContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskConstants<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' Canceled' defaultValue' canceled
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Nito.AsyncEx.TaskExtensions' Nito.AsyncEx.Synchronous.TaskExtensions
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskFactoryExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskFactoryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx.Interop,ApmAsyncFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\Interop\ApmAsyncFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx.Interop,EventArguments,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\Interop\EventArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Sender' EventArgs
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx.Interop,EventAsyncFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\Interop\EventAsyncFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nito.AsyncEx.Synchronous,TaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\Synchronous\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Nito.AsyncEx,TaskConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\TaskConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BooleanTrue' BooleanFalse' Int32Zero' Int32NegativeOne' Completed' Canceled' booleanTrue' intNegativeOne
Insufficient Modularization,Nito.AsyncEx.Interop,EventAsyncFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StephenCleary_AsyncEx\src\Nito.AsyncEx.Tasks\Interop\EventAsyncFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
