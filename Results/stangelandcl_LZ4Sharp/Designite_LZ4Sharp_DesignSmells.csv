Unutilized Abstraction,LZ4Sharp,LZ4,C:\repos\stangelandcl_LZ4Sharp\LZ4Sharp\LZ4.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,LZ4Sharp,LZ4Decompressor64,C:\repos\stangelandcl_LZ4Sharp\LZ4Sharp\LZ4Decompressor64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  LZ4Decompressor64 (C:\repos\stangelandcl_LZ4Sharp\LZ4Sharp\LZ4Decompressor64.cs' [101' 121])' LZ4Decompressor64 (C:\repos\stangelandcl_LZ4Sharp\LZ4Sharp\LZ4Decompressor64.cs' [234' 254])
