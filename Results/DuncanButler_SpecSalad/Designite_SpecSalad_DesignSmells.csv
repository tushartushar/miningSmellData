Broken Hierarchy,SpecSalad,ApplicationRole,F:\newReposMay17\DuncanButler_SpecSalad\Production\SpecSalad\ApplicationRole.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TaskBase
Wide Hierarchy,SpecSalad,ApplicationTask,F:\newReposMay17\DuncanButler_SpecSalad\Production\SpecSalad\ApplicationTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Add' Calculate' SeeTheAnswer' Subtract' SwitchOnTheCalculator' AvailableColours' BeAbleToRetrieveTheAnswer' DoTheReturnOneTask' DoTheReturnTask' DoTheReturnThreeTask' DoTheSubtractOneTask' GetTheAnswer' RetrieveTheAnswer' SeeOne' SeeTheAnswer' SeeTheAnswers' SeeTheFavouriteColourIs' Store' StoreInTheTask' TheFavouriteColours' UpVoteTheAnswer' SetThePlaceAtTheTable' LayTheTable
Broken Hierarchy,SpecSalad,ApplicationTask,F:\newReposMay17\DuncanButler_SpecSalad\Production\SpecSalad\ApplicationTask.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TaskBase
