Unnecessary Abstraction,ReplicatedEventSample.Interfaces,Outcome,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\Samples\1.x\ReplicatedEventSample\ReplicatedEventSample.Interfaces\Outcome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' Score' When
Deficient Encapsulation,ReplicatedEventSample.Interfaces,Outcome,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\Samples\1.x\ReplicatedEventSample\ReplicatedEventSample.Interfaces\Outcome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Score' When
