Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric,OrleansServiceFabricExtensions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric\OrleansServiceFabricExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric,ServiceFabricClusteringOptions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric\ServiceFabricClusteringOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UnknownSiloRemovalPeriod
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric.Utilities,ResolvedServicePartitionExtensions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric\Utilities\ResolvedServicePartitionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Rebellious Hierarchy,Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric.Utilities,ResolvedServicePartitionWrapper,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ServiceFabric\Utilities\FabricQueryManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
