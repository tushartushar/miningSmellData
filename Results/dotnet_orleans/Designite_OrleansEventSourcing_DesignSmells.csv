Deficient Encapsulation,Orleans.EventSourcing.Common,SubmissionEntry,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansEventSourcing\Common\PrimaryBasedLogViewAdaptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Entry' SubmissionTime' ResultPromise' ConditionalPosition
Insufficient Modularization,Orleans.EventSourcing.Common,PrimaryBasedLogViewAdaptor,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansEventSourcing\Common\PrimaryBasedLogViewAdaptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,Orleans.EventSourcing.LogStorage,DefaultAdaptorFactory,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansEventSourcing\LogStorage\DefaultAdaptorFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: DefaultAdaptorFactory[12' 31]' DefaultAdaptorFactory[12' 31]
Unfactored Hierarchy,Orleans.EventSourcing.LogStorage,LogConsistencyProvider,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansEventSourcing\LogStorage\LogConsistencyProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
