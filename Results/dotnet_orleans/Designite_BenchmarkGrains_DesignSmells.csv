Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,BenchmarkGrains.Ping,LoadGrain,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\Ping\LoadGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: BenchmarkGrains.Ping.LoadGrain' BenchmarkGrains.Transaction.LoadGrain
Unnecessary Abstraction,BenchmarkGrains.Ping,Pending,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\Ping\LoadGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Grain' PendingCall
Unnecessary Abstraction,BenchmarkGrains.Transaction,Info,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\Transaction\TransactionGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Deep Hierarchy,BenchmarkGrains.MapReduce,BufferGrain<T>,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\MapReduce\BufferGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the depth of inheritance for this class is more than recommended. The depth of inheritance for this class is: 6
Broken Hierarchy,BenchmarkGrains.MapReduce,BufferGrain<T>,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\MapReduce\BufferGrain.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BenchmarkGrains.MapReduce.DataflowGrain' BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.MapReduce.IBufferGrain
Rebellious Hierarchy,BenchmarkGrains.MapReduce,DataflowGrain,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\MapReduce\DataflowGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Complete' Fault' Completion
Rebellious Hierarchy,BenchmarkGrains.MapReduce,TargetGrain<TInput>,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\MapReduce\TargetGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OfferMessage' SendAsync' SendAsync
Deep Hierarchy,BenchmarkGrains.MapReduce,TransformGrain<TInput;TOutput>,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\BenchmarkGrains\MapReduce\TransformGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the depth of inheritance for this class is more than recommended. The depth of inheritance for this class is: 6
