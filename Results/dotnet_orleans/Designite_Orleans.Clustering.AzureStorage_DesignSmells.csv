Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Runtime.MembershipService,AzureBasedMembershipTable,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\AzureBasedMembershipTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.AzureUtils,AzureGatewayListProvider,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\AzureGatewayListProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,AzureTableMembershipHostingOptions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\AzureTableMembershipHostingOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.AzureUtils.Storage,LegacyAzureTableGatewayListProviderConfigurator,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\LegacyAzureTableGatewayListProviderConfigurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Orleans.Runtime.MultiClusterNetwork,GossipTableInstanceManager,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\MultiClusterNetwork\GossipTableInstanceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.AzureUtils.Options,AzureTableGatewayListProviderOptions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\Options\AzureTableGatewayListProviderOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionString
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.AzureUtils.Configuration,AzureTableMembershipOptions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\Options\AzureTableMembershipOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxStorageBusyRetries' ConnectionString
Duplicate Abstraction,Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage,AzureStorageUtils,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Shared\Storage\AzureStorageUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AzureStorageUtils (C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Shared\Storage\AzureStorageUtils.cs' [9' 34])' AzureTableDataManager<T> (C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Shared\Storage\AzureTableDataManager.cs' [9' 34])
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage,AzureTableDataManager<T>,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Shared\Storage\AzureTableDataManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage,TableDataManagerInternalExtensions,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Shared\Storage\AzureTableDataManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Orleans.Runtime.MultiClusterNetwork,GossipTableEntry,C:\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Azure\Orleans.Clustering.AzureStorage\MultiClusterNetwork\GossipTableInstanceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ClusterId' Address' Port' Generation' SiloAddress
