Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,ApplicationPartManagerCodeGenExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\ApplicationPartManagerCodeGenExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,FeatureDescriptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\FeatureDescriptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GrainClasses' GrainInterfaces' Serializers
Imperative Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,FeaturePopulatorGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\FeaturePopulatorGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateSyntax
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,GeneratedSyntax,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\GeneratedSyntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SourceAssemblies' Syntax
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,GrainInterfaceDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\GrainInterfaceDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Interface' Reference' Invoker' InterfaceId
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,GrainClassDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\GrainInterfaceDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ClassType
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,SerializationTypeDescriptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\GrainInterfaceDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SerializerTypes' KnownTypes
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,SerializerTypeDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\GrainInterfaceDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Serializer' Target
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator,KnownTypeDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\GrainInterfaceDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' TypeKey
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGenerator.Utilities,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\Utilities\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Orleans.CodeGenerator.Utilities,SyntaxFactoryExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration\Utilities\SyntaxFactoryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
