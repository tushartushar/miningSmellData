Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Configuration,AdoNetReminderTableOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet\ReminderService\AdoNetReminderTableOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Invariant' ConnectionString
Feature Envy,Orleans.Configuration,AdoNetReminderTableOptionsValidator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet\ReminderService\AdoNetReminderTableOptionsValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ValidateConfiguration which is more interested in members of the type: AdoNetReminderTableOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,SiloHostBuilderReminderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet\SiloHostBuilderReminderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet.Storage,IRelationalStorage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\IRelationalStorage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IRelationalStorage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\IRelationalStorage.cs' [34' 76])' RelationalStorage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\RelationalStorage.cs' [108' 150])
Feature Envy,Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet.Storage,RelationalOrleansQueries,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\RelationalOrleansQueries.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ReadReminderRowsAsync which is more interested in members of the type: DbStoredQueries
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet.Storage,RelationalStorageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\RelationalStorageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet.Storage,AdoNetInvariants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\AdoNetInvariants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Invariants' InvariantNameSqlServer' InvariantNameOracleDatabase' InvariantNameSqlLite' InvariantNameMySql' InvariantNamePostgreSql
Rebellious Hierarchy,Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet.Storage,NoOpCommandInterceptor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\NoOpDatabaseCommandInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Intercept
Rebellious Hierarchy,Orleans.Reminders.AdoNet.Storage,OrleansRelationalDownloadStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\AdoNet\Shared\Storage\OrleansRelationalDownloadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
