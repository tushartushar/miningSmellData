Duplicate Abstraction,DependencyInjection.Tests.Autofac,Fixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\DependencyInjection.Tests\Autofac\DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingAutofac.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: DependencyInjection.Tests.Autofac.Fixture' DependencyInjection.Tests.DefaultServiceProvider.Fixture' DependencyInjection.Tests.StructureMap.Fixture
Unnecessary Abstraction,DependencyInjection.Tests,IValue,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\DependencyInjection.Tests\DependencyInjectionDisambiguationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value

Broken Hierarchy,DependencyInjection.Tests.Autofac,DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingAutofac,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\DependencyInjection.Tests\Autofac\DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingAutofac.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DependencyInjection.Tests.DependencyInjectionGrainTestRunner
Broken Hierarchy,DependencyInjection.Tests.DefaultServiceProvider,DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingDefaultServiceProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\DependencyInjection.Tests\DefaultServiceProvider\DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingDefaultServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DependencyInjection.Tests.DependencyInjectionGrainTestRunner
Broken Hierarchy,DependencyInjection.Tests.StructureMap,DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingStructureMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\DependencyInjection.Tests\StructureMap\DependencyInjectionGrainTestsUsingStructureMap.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DependencyInjection.Tests.DependencyInjectionGrainTestRunner
