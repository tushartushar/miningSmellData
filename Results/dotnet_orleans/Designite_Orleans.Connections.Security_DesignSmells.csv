Feature Envy,Orleans.Connections.Security,TlsClientConnectionMiddleware,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Connections.Security\Security\TlsClientConnectionMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InnerOnConnectionAsync which is more interested in members of the type: TlsOptions
