Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,AWSUtils.Tests,AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests' AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.AWSUtils,AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.AWSTestConstants' AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.DynamoDBStorageStressTests' AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.AWSUtils.DynamoDBStorageTests,AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.AWSTestConstants' AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.DynamoDBStorageStressTests' AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.AWSUtils.DynamoDBStorageTests
Unstable Dependency,AWSUtils.Tests,AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.AWSUtils,AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.DynamoDBStorageTests,AWSUtils.Tests.StorageTests.DynamoDBStorageTests
Feature Concentration,AWSUtils.Tests,AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SQSAdapterTests]' [SQSClientStreamTests' MySiloBuilderConfigurator' MyClientBuilderConfigurator' SQSStreamTests' SQSSubscriptionMultiplicityTests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.SQSAdapterTests,AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.SQSAdapterTests' AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.SQSClientStreamTests' AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.MySiloBuilderConfigurator' AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.MyClientBuilderConfigurator' AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.SQSStreamTests' AWSUtils.Tests.Streaming.SQSSubscriptionMultiplicityTests
