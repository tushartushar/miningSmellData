Unutilized Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.MapReduce,ITargetProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\MapReduce\DataflowGrainsInterfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.MapReduce,ITransformGrain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\MapReduce\DataflowGrainsInterfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.MapReduce,IBufferGrain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\MapReduce\DataflowGrainsInterfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Ping,Report,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\Ping\ILoadGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Succeeded' Failed' Elapsed
Duplicate Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Ping,Report,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\Ping\ILoadGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Ping.Report' BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Transaction.Report
Duplicate Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Ping,ILoadGrain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\Ping\ILoadGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Ping.ILoadGrain' BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Transaction.ILoadGrain
Unnecessary Abstraction,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.Transaction,Report,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Grains\BenchmarkGrainInterfaces\Transaction\ILoadGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Succeeded' Failed' Throttled' Elapsed
