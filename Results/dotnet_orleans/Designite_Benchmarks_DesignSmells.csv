Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Benchmarks.GrainStorage,SiloMemoryStorageConfigurator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\GrainStorage\GrainStorageBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Benchmarks.GrainStorage.SiloMemoryStorageConfigurator' Benchmarks.Transactions.SiloMemoryStorageConfigurator
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmarks.MapReduce,MapReduceBenchmarkConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\MapReduce\MapReduceBenchmarkConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Benchmarks,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarks.Serialization,ISomeInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\Serialization\SerializationBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Int
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarks.Serialization,AnotherConcreteClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\Serialization\SerializationBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Int' AnotherString
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmarks.Serialization,InnerType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\Serialization\SerializationBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Benchmarks.Ping,WorkBlock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\Ping\ConcurrentLoadGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartTimestamp' EndTimestamp' Successes' Failures' Completed' ElapsedSeconds' RequestsPerSecond
Broken Hierarchy,Benchmarks.Serialization,PrivateConcreteClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Benchmarks\Serialization\SerializationBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Benchmarks.Serialization.SomeConcreteClass
