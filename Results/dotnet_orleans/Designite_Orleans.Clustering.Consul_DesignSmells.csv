Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions.cs' [26' 49])' ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\ConsulUtilsHostingExtensions.cs' [78' 101])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Configuration,ConsulClusteringClientOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\Options\ConsulClusteringClientOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Address' AclClientToken' KvRootFolder
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Configuration,ConsulClusteringSiloOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\Options\ConsulClusteringSiloOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Address' AclClientToken' KvRootFolder
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Runtime.Host,SuspectingSilo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.Consul\SerializableMembershipTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
