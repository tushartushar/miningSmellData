Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,TestServiceFabric,OrleansCommunicationListenerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\OrleansCommunicationListenerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TestServiceFabric,OrleansCommunicationListenerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\OrleansCommunicationListenerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OrleansCommunicationListenerTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\OrleansCommunicationListenerTests.cs' [103' 132])' OrleansCommunicationListenerTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\OrleansCommunicationListenerTests.cs' [141' 170])
Unutilized Abstraction,TestServiceFabric,TestOutputLoggerProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\TestOutputLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,TestServiceFabric,EndpointsCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\EndpointsCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetKeyForItem
Broken Hierarchy,TestServiceFabric,TestOutputLogger<TCategoryName>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\test\Extensions\TestServiceFabric\TestOutputLogger.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestServiceFabric.TestOutputLogger
