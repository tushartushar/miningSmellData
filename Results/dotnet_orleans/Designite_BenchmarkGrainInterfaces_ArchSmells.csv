Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.MapReduce,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Orleans
Feature Concentration,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces,BenchmarkGrainInterfaces.MapReduce,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IDataflowGrain' ITargetGrain' ISourceGrain' IPropagatorGrain' ITransformGrain' IBufferGrain' IProcessor]' [ITargetProcessor]' [ITransformProcessor]' [GrainDataflowMessageStatus]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.4
