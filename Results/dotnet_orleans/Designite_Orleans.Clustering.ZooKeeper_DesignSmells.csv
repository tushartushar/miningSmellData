Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Configuration,ZooKeeperClusteringSiloOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ZooKeeper\Options\ZooKeeperClusteringSiloOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionString
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.Configuration,ZooKeeperGatewayListProviderOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ZooKeeper\Options\ZooKeeperGatewayListProviderOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionString
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,ZooKeeperHostingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ZooKeeper\ZooKeeperHostingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Orleans.Hosting,ZooKeeperHostingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ZooKeeper\ZooKeeperHostingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ZooKeeperHostingExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ZooKeeper\ZooKeeperHostingExtensions.cs' [26' 49])' ZooKeeperHostingExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.Clustering.ZooKeeper\ZooKeeperHostingExtensions.cs' [78' 101])
