Insufficient Modularization,Orleans.Runtime.Management,ManagementGrain,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Core\ManagementGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Missing Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime,SiloAssemblyLoader,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\GrainTypeManager\SiloAssemblyLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Grain' LogConsistentGrainBase (in method "GetGrainClassTypes" of class "SiloAssemblyLoader").
Missing Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime,GrainTypeData,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\GrainTypeManager\GrainTypeData.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ReentrantAttribute' InvokeMethodRequest (in method "GetMayInterleavePredicate" of class "GrainTypeData").
Missing Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime,Catalog,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Catalog\Catalog.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IStatefulGrain' ILogConsistentGrain (in method "CreateGrainInstance" of class "Catalog").
Missing Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime,InsideRuntimeClient,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Core\InsideRuntimeClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IGrainExtensionMethodInvoker' IGrainExtension (in method "Invoke" of class "InsideRuntimeClient").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime.Placement,ClientObserversPlacementDirector,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Placement\ClientObserversPlacementDirector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnAddActivation
Multipath Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime.Placement,PreferLocalPlacementDirector,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Placement\PreferLocalPlacementDirector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IPlacementDirector
Multipath Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime.Placement,ActivationCountPlacementDirector,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Placement\ActivationCountPlacementDirector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IPlacementDirector
Rebellious Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime.GrainDirectory,NullGrainDirectoryCache,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\GrainDirectory\GrainDirectoryCacheFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clear
Unfactored Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime.ConsistentRing,ConsistentRingProvider,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\ConsistentRing\ConsistentRingProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ConsistentRingProvider[246' 267]' VirtualBucketsRingProvider[80' 101]
Rebellious Hierarchy,Orleans.Runtime.Scheduler,WorkItemBase,F:\newReposMay17\dotnet_orleans\src\OrleansRuntime\Scheduler\WorkItemBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
