Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGeneration,AssemblyLoadContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration.Build\AssemblyResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGeneration,CodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration.Build\CodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateCode
Unnecessary Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGeneration,CodeGenOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration.Build\CodeGenOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LogLevel' InputAssembly' ReferencedAssemblies' OutputFileName
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGeneration,GetDotNetHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration.Build\GetDotNetHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Orleans.CodeGeneration,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration.Build\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Deficient Encapsulation,Orleans.CodeGeneration,CodeGenOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_orleans\src\Orleans.CodeGeneration.Build\CodeGenOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: InputAssembly' ReferencedAssemblies' OutputFileName
