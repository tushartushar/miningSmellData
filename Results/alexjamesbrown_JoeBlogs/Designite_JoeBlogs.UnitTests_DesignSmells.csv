Duplicate Abstraction,JoeBlogs,Map,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs\Mapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Map (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs\Mapper.cs' [278' 298])' Map (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs\Mapper.cs' [304' 324])
Duplicate Abstraction,JoeBlogs,From,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs\Mapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: JoeBlogs.From' JoeBlogs.Tests.Mapping.From
Duplicate Abstraction,JoeBlogs,To,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs\Mapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: JoeBlogs.To' JoeBlogs.Tests.Mapping.To
Unutilized Abstraction,JoeBlogs.Tests.Mapping,From,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs.UnitTests\Mapping\From.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JoeBlogs.Tests.Mapping,General,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs.UnitTests\Mapping\General.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JoeBlogs.Tests.Mapping,To,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs.UnitTests\Mapping\To.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,JoeBlogs.Tests,WordpressWrapperTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs.UnitTests\WordpressWrapperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,JoeBlogs.Tests,WordpressWrapperTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexjamesbrown_JoeBlogs\JoeBlogs.UnitTests\WordpressWrapperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
