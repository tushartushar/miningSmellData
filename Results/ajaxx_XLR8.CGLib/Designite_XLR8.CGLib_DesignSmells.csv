Unutilized Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,CapsuleEmitter,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\CapsuleEmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,FastBase,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\FastBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetParameterTypes
Multifaceted Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,FastClass,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\FastClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.8
Unutilized Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,FastClassUtil,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\FastClassUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,FastConstructor,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\FastConstructor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: New
Duplicate Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,FastConstructor,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\FastConstructor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FastConstructor[1' 22]' FastField[1' 22]' FastProperty[1' 22]
Unutilized Abstraction,XLR8.CGLib,FastEmitter,C:\repos\ajaxx_XLR8.CGLib\XLR8.CGLib\FastEmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
