Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: PushState
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteDataSnapshot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Restore
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RoutingHttpContextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RoutingHttpContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,IRouter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\IRouter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,VirtualPathData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\VirtualPathData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.VirtualPathData' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,IRouter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\IRouter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.VirtualPathData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.VirtualPathData' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData
Wide Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,IRouteConstraint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\IRouteConstraint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.BoolRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.CompositeRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.DateTimeRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.DecimalRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.DoubleRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.FloatRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.GuidRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.HttpMethodRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.LengthRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.LongRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.MaxLengthRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.MaxRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.MinLengthRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.MinRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.NullRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.OptionalRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.RangeRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.RegexRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.RequiredRouteConstraint' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints.StringRouteConstraint
