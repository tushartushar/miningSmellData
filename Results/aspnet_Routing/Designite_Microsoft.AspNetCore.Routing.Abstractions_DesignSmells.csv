Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteContext,C:\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteContext,C:\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteDataSnapshot
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteData,C:\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteDataSnapshot
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteData,C:\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteContext' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteDataSnapshot,C:\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteDataSnapshot' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing,RouteDataSnapshot,C:\repos\aspnet_Routing\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Abstractions\RouteData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
