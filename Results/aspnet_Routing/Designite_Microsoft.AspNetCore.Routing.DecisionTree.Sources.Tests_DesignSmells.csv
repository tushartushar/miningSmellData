Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree,DecisionTreeBuilderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree.Sources.Tests\DecisionTreeBuilderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree,DecisionCriterion<TItem>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\shared\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree.Sources\DecisionCriterion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' Branches
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree,DecisionTreeBuilder<TItem>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\shared\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree.Sources\DecisionTreeBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateTree
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree,DecisionTreeNode<TItem>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\shared\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree.Sources\DecisionTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Matches' Criteria
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree,ItemDescriptor<TItem>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Routing\shared\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.DecisionTree.Sources\ItemDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Criteria' Index' Item
