Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ParticleSample,Particle,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\Particle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ParticleSample,ParticleSampleGame,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ParticleSampleGame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RandomBetween
Duplicate Abstraction,ParticleSample,ParticleSystem,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ParticleSystem[1' 20]' SmokePlumeParticleSystem[1' 20]
Deficient Encapsulation,ParticleSample,Particle,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\Particle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Velocity' Acceleration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ParticleSample,ExplosionParticleSystem,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ExplosionParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExplosionParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ParticleSample,ExplosionParticleSystem,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ExplosionParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExplosionParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame' ExplosionSmokeParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ParticleSample,ExplosionSmokeParticleSystem,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ExplosionSmokeParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExplosionSmokeParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ParticleSample,SmokePlumeParticleSystem,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\SmokePlumeParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SmokePlumeParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ParticleSample,SmokePlumeParticleSystem,F:\newReposMay17\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\SmokePlumeParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SmokePlumeParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame' ExplosionParticleSystem' ParticleSampleGame
