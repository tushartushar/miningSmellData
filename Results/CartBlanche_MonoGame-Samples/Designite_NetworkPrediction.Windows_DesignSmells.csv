Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,NetworkPrediction,Tank,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\NetworkPrediction\Tank.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WriteNetworkPacket which is more interested in members of the type: TankState
Unnecessary Abstraction,NetworkPrediction,TankState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\NetworkPrediction\Tank.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' Velocity' TankRotation' TurretRotation
Deficient Encapsulation,NetworkPrediction,TankState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\NetworkPrediction\Tank.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Velocity' TankRotation' TurretRotation
