Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ParticleSample,ParticleSampleGame,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ParticleSampleGame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RandomBetween
Duplicate Abstraction,ParticleSample,ParticleSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ParticleSystem (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\ParticleSystem.cs' [1' 20])' SmokePlumeParticleSystem (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\SmokePlumeParticleSystem.cs' [1' 20])
Deficient Encapsulation,ParticleSample,Particle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\ParticleSample\Particle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Velocity' Acceleration
