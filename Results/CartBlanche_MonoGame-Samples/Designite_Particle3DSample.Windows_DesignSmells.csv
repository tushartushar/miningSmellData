Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Particle3DSample,ParticleSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\Particle3DSample\ParticleSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadParticleEffect which is more interested in members of the type: ParticleSettings
Deficient Encapsulation,Particle3DSample,ParticleVertex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\Particle3DSample\ParticleVertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Corner' Position' Velocity' Random' Time
Broken Modularization,Particle3DSample,ParticleVertex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\Particle3DSample\ParticleVertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Corner' Position' Velocity' Random' Time' VertexDeclaration' SizeInBytes
