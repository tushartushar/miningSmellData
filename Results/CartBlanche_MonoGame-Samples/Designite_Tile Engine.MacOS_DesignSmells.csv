Unutilized Abstraction,Tile_Engine,TileMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\BookSourceCode\XNAGameDevelopmentbyExampleCode\GemstoneHunter\TileEngine\TileMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tile_Engine,MapSquare,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\BookSourceCode\XNAGameDevelopmentbyExampleCode\GemstoneHunter\TileEngine\MapSquare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LayerTiles' CodeValue' Passable
Deficient Encapsulation,Tile_Engine,TileMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\BookSourceCode\XNAGameDevelopmentbyExampleCode\GemstoneHunter\TileEngine\TileMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EditorMode' spriteFont
Deficient Encapsulation,Tile_Engine,TileMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\BookSourceCode\XNAGameDevelopmentbyExampleCode\GemstoneHunter\TileEngine\TileMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: EditorMode' spriteFont
Insufficient Modularization,Tile_Engine,TileMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CartBlanche_MonoGame-Samples\BookSourceCode\XNAGameDevelopmentbyExampleCode\GemstoneHunter\TileEngine\TileMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
