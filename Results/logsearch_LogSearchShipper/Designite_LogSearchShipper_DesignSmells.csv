Unutilized Abstraction,LogSearchShipper.Log4net,DefaultConsoleAppender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\logsearch_LogSearchShipper\src\LogSearchShipper\Log4net\DefaultConsoleAppender.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,LogSearchShipper,LogSearchShipperService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\logsearch_LogSearchShipper\src\LogSearchShipper\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServiceName
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LogSearchShipper,MainClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\logsearch_LogSearchShipper\src\LogSearchShipper\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LogSearchShipper.MainClass' LogSearchShipper.LogSearchShipperService
Broken Hierarchy,LogSearchShipper.Log4net,EdbExpectedEventSourcesAppender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\logsearch_LogSearchShipper\src\LogSearchShipper\Log4net\EdbExpectedEventSourcesAppender.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LogSearchShipper.Log4net.DefaultFileAppender
Broken Hierarchy,LogSearchShipper.Log4net,EnvironmentDiagramAppender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\logsearch_LogSearchShipper\src\LogSearchShipper\Log4net\EnvironmentDiagramAppender.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LogSearchShipper.Log4net.DefaultFileAppender
