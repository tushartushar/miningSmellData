Cyclic Dependency,LogsearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: LogSearchShipper.Core' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog,LogSearchShipper.Core.LogSearchShipperProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.NxLogProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.ServiceControllerEx
Unstable Dependency,LogsearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog,LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLogProcessManager
