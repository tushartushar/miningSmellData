Duplicate Abstraction,Caliburn.Micro.Harness,EventSubscriptionActivator,C:\repos\HarnessProject_Harness\Source\Caliburn.Micro\Caliburn.Micro.Harness.SL5\..\Caliburn.Micro.Harness.Net45\EventSubscriptionActivator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EventSubscriptionActivator[1' 22]' InstanceRegistration[1' 22]
Duplicate Abstraction,Caliburn.Micro.Harness,EventSubscriptionActivator,C:\repos\HarnessProject_Harness\Source\Caliburn.Micro\Caliburn.Micro.Harness.SL5\..\Caliburn.Micro.Harness.Net45\EventSubscriptionActivator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EventSubscriptionActivator[1' 22]' ViewModel[1' 22]' Shell[1' 22]' InstanceRegistration[1' 22]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Caliburn.Micro.Harness,ViewModel,C:\repos\HarnessProject_Harness\Source\Caliburn.Micro\Caliburn.Micro.Harness.SL5\..\Caliburn.Micro.Harness.Net45\Screen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
