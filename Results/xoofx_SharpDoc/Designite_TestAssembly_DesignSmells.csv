Unnecessary Abstraction,TestAssembly,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xoofx_SharpDoc\src\TestAssembly\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TestAssembly,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xoofx_SharpDoc\src\TestAssembly\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestAssembly,Struct1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xoofx_SharpDoc\src\TestAssembly\Struct1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TestAssembly,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xoofx_SharpDoc\src\TestAssembly\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IntField1
