Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DeepCopy
Multifaceted Abstraction,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Unnecessary Abstraction,JPEG.Encryption.Gui.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Insufficient Modularization,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 167
Missing Hierarchy,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeNodeEncryptedImage' TreeNodeImage (in method "buttonDecrypt_Click" of class "FormMain").
Missing Hierarchy,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeNodeEncryptedImage' TreeNodeImage (in method "AddDecryptedImageToTreeView" of class "FormMain").
Missing Hierarchy,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeNodeImage' TreeNodeEncryptedImage (in method "radioButtonGetRoIFromMouse_CheckedChanged" of class "FormMain").
Missing Hierarchy,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeNodeImage' TreeNodeEncryptedImage (in method "DrawRoIs" of class "FormMain").
Missing Hierarchy,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeNodeImage' TreeNodeEncryptedImage (in method "DetectFacesOnPreview" of class "FormMain").
Missing Hierarchy,JPEG.Encryption.Gui,FormMain,C:\repos\StefanAuer_JPEG.Encryption\JPEG.Encryption.C#\JPEG.Encryption.Gui\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeNodeImage' TreeNodeEncryptedImage (in method "saveImageAsToolStripMenuItem_Click" of class "FormMain").
