Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Xintric.MUtil.LinAlg,EigenVectors,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_MUtil\LinAlg\EigenVectors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Xintric.MUtil.LinAlg,EigenVectors,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_MUtil\LinAlg\EigenVectors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EigenVectors[78' 97]' Matrix[188' 207]
Duplicate Abstraction,Xintric.MUtil.LinAlg,EigenVectors,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_MUtil\LinAlg\EigenVectors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EigenVectors[99' 123]' Matrix[209' 233]
Deficient Encapsulation,Xintric.MUtil.LinAlg,LUP,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_MUtil\LinAlg\LUP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: matrix' pivot
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xintric.MUtil.LinAlg,LUP,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_MUtil\LinAlg\LUP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LUP' Matrix
