Insufficient Modularization,OathNet.Test,Base32Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jennings_OATH.Net\OATH.Net.Test\Base32Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
