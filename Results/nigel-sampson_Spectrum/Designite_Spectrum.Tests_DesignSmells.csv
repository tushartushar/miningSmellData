Unnecessary Abstraction,Spectrum.Tests,ColorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum.Tests\ColorTests.HSV.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Spectrum.Tests,ColorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum.Tests\ColorTests.HSV.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spectrum.Tests,HSV,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum.Tests\ColorTests.HSV.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spectrum.Tests,HSL,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum.Tests\ColorTests.HSL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spectrum.Tests,RGB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum.Tests\ColorTests.RGB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
