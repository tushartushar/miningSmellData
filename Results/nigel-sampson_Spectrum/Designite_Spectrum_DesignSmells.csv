Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Spectrum,Color,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\Color.HSL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Spectrum,Color,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\Color.HSL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Spectrum,RGB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\Color.RGB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RGB (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\Color.RGB.cs' [133' 155])' RGB (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\Color.RGB.cs' [182' 204])
Unutilized Abstraction,Spectrum,DoubleExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\DoubleExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spectrum,HSV,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nigel-sampson_Spectrum\Spectrum\Color.HSV.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Spectrum.HSV' Spectrum.RGB
