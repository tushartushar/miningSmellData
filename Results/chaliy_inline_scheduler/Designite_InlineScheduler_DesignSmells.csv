Unutilized Abstraction,InlineScheduler.Advanced,DateTimeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Advanced\DateTimeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,InlineScheduler.Advanced,IJobState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Advanced\IJobState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Status' Created' LastStart' LastComplete
Unnecessary Abstraction,InlineScheduler.Advanced,JobRun,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Advanced\JobRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Started' Completed' Result' ResultMessage
Unnecessary Abstraction,InlineScheduler,MinimalJobStats,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\MinimalJobStats.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: JobKey' Description' CurrentStatus' Health' Report
Feature Envy,InlineScheduler,Scheduler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Scheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnTimerElapsed which is more interested in members of the type: JobManager
Feature Envy,InlineScheduler,Scheduler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Scheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Schedule which is more interested in members of the type: JobManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,InlineScheduler,SchedulerJobRunStats,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\SchedulerJobRunStats.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Started' Completed' Result' ResultMessage
Unutilized Abstraction,InlineScheduler,JobFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Schedules.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,InlineScheduler.Server.Advanced.Hosting,HostingRegistration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Server\Advanced\Hosting\HostingRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Stop which is more interested in members of the type: Scheduler
Unnecessary Abstraction,InlineScheduler.Server,InlineSchedulerServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chaliy_inline_scheduler\src\InlineScheduler\Server\InlineSchedulerWebHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
