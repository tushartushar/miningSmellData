Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,Data,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\Data.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Team' Country' DetailsSource
Unnecessary Abstraction,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,Details,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\Details.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Season' Place' WDL' Points
Duplicate Abstraction,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,DetailsPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\DetailsPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DetailsPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\DetailsPage.xaml.cs' [1' 21])' MainPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\MainPage.xaml.cs' [1' 21])
Unutilized Abstraction,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,LabelConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\LabelConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,WDL,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\WDL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Category' Value
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,CustomCellDoubleTapped,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\CustomCellDoubleTapped.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand.CustomCellDoubleTapped' Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand.MainPage' Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand.DetailsPage
Rebellious Hierarchy,Commands_CellDoubleTappedCommand,MainPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_win8-xaml-sdk\Grid\Commands-CellDoubleTappedCommand\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnNavigatedTo
