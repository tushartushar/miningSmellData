Unnecessary Abstraction,PageTypeBuilder.Migrations,IMigrationContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelabrahamsson_Page-Type-Builder\PageTypeBuilder.Migrations\IMigrationContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PageTypeRepository' PageDefinitionRepository' PageDefinitionTypeRepository' TabDefinitionRepository' NativePageDefinitionsMap
Unutilized Abstraction,PageTypeBuilder.Migrations,MigrationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelabrahamsson_Page-Type-Builder\PageTypeBuilder.Migrations\MigrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PageTypeBuilder.Migrations,PageDefinitionAction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelabrahamsson_Page-Type-Builder\PageTypeBuilder.Migrations\PageDefinitionAction.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetPageDefinitionType which is more interested in members of the type: IMigrationContext
Unutilized Abstraction,PageTypeBuilder.Migrations,PageTypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelabrahamsson_Page-Type-Builder\PageTypeBuilder.Migrations\PageTypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,PageTypeBuilder.Migrations,IMigrationContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelabrahamsson_Page-Type-Builder\PageTypeBuilder.Migrations\IMigrationContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PageTypeRepository' PageDefinitionRepository' PageDefinitionTypeRepository' TabDefinitionRepository' NativePageDefinitionsMap
Rebellious Hierarchy,PageTypeBuilder.Migrations,Migration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelabrahamsson_Page-Type-Builder\PageTypeBuilder.Migrations\Migration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
