Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,AvayaPDSEmulator,Startup,C:\repos\mlittle_avaya-moagent-client\AvayaPDSEmulator\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Startup[1' 23]' StateObject[1' 23]
Deficient Encapsulation,AvayaPDSEmulator,StateObject,C:\repos\mlittle_avaya-moagent-client\AvayaPDSEmulator\AvayaPdsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' WorkSocket' Buffer' sb' CurrentState' CurrentJob' LeaveJob' Disconnect
Deficient Encapsulation,AvayaPDSEmulator,AvayaPdsServer,C:\repos\mlittle_avaya-moagent-client\AvayaPDSEmulator\AvayaPdsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AllDone' States
Deficient Encapsulation,AvayaPDSEmulator,AvayaPdsServer,C:\repos\mlittle_avaya-moagent-client\AvayaPDSEmulator\AvayaPdsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AllDone' States
Broken Modularization,AvayaPDSEmulator,StateObject,C:\repos\mlittle_avaya-moagent-client\AvayaPDSEmulator\AvayaPdsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' WorkSocket' BufferSize' Buffer' sb' CurrentState' CurrentJob' LeaveJob' Disconnect
Insufficient Modularization,AvayaPDSEmulator,AvayaPdsServer,C:\repos\mlittle_avaya-moagent-client\AvayaPDSEmulator\AvayaPdsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 157
