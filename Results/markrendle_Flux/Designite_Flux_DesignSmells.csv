Unutilized Abstraction,Flux,DictionaryExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Flux\src\Flux\DictionaryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Flux,DisposableEx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Flux\src\Flux\DisposableEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Flux,ServerKeys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Flux\src\Flux\OwinKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RemoteIpAddress' RemotePort' LocalIpAddress' LocalPort' IsLocal
Unutilized Abstraction,Flux,ServerKeys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Flux\src\Flux\OwinKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
