Unutilized Abstraction,CrossGraphics,GraphicsEx,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CrossGraphics,IImage,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CrossGraphics,FontMetricsEx,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CrossGraphics,Transform2D,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CrossGraphics,PointEx,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CrossGraphics,RectangleEx,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics,ColorTag,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\CoreGraphicsGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UIColor' CGColor
Deficient Encapsulation,CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics,CoreGraphicsFontMetrics,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\CoreGraphicsGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Widths
Deficient Encapsulation,CrossGraphics,Color,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Tag
Deficient Encapsulation,CrossGraphics,Transform2D,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: M11' M12' M13' M21' M22' M23
Insufficient Modularization,CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics,CoreGraphicsGraphics,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\CoreGraphicsGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics,CoreGraphicsGraphics,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\CoreGraphicsGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Modularization,CrossGraphics,Colors,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\Graphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Yellow' Red' Green' Blue' White' Cyan' Black' LightGray' Gray' DarkGray
Broken Hierarchy,CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics,UIKitGraphics,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\CoreGraphicsGraphics.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics.CoreGraphicsGraphics
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossGraphics.CoreGraphics,CoreGraphicsGraphics,C:\repos\praeclarum_CrossGraphics\src\CoreGraphicsGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BeginEntity
