Unfactored Hierarchy,PacketDotNet.Tcp,MaximumSegmentSize,C:\repos\dan-sw_PTP_GUI\PacketDotNet\PacketDotNet\Tcp\MaximumSegmentSize.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: MaximumSegmentSize[1' 26]' WindowScaleFactor[1' 26]' SACKPermitted[1' 26]' SACK[1' 26]' TimeStamp[1' 26]' AlternateChecksumRequest[1' 26]' AlternateChecksumData[1' 26]' MD5Signature[1' 26]' UserTimeout[1' 26]
Wide Hierarchy,PacketDotNet.Tcp,Option,C:\repos\dan-sw_PTP_GUI\PacketDotNet\PacketDotNet\Tcp\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: NoOperation' EndOfOptions' MaximumSegmentSize' WindowScaleFactor' SACKPermitted' SACK' EchoReply' TimeStamp' Echo' AlternateChecksumRequest' AlternateChecksumData' MD5Signature' UserTimeout
