Insufficient Modularization,Deja.Crypto.BcPgp,PgpCrypto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dejavusecurity_OutlookPrivacyPlugin\Deja.Crypto\BcPgp\PgpCrypto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Deja.Crypto.BcPgp,PgpCrypto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dejavusecurity_OutlookPrivacyPlugin\Deja.Crypto\BcPgp\PgpCrypto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Deja.Crypto.BcPgp,PgpCrypto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dejavusecurity_OutlookPrivacyPlugin\Deja.Crypto\BcPgp\PgpCrypto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 188
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Deja.Crypto.BcPgp,PgpCrypto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dejavusecurity_OutlookPrivacyPlugin\Deja.Crypto\BcPgp\PgpCrypto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Deja.Crypto.BcPgp.PgpCrypto' Deja.Crypto.BcPgp.CryptoContext
