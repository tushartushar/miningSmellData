Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EarlyAlarmSystem.Database,TypesDB,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Database\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,SMSSender_Resalty,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\SMSSender_Resalty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SMSSender_Resalty[23' 53]' SMSSender_Resalty[73' 103]
Duplicate Abstraction,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,SMSSender_Resalty,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\SMSSender_Resalty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SMSSender_Resalty[98' 132]' SMSSender[75' 109]
Imperative Abstraction,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,NetworkHandler,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\NetworkHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: HandleIncommingNetowrkCommunication
Duplicate Abstraction,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,SMSSender,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\SMSSender.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SMSSender[23' 42]' SMSSender[61' 80]
Deficient Encapsulation,EarlyAlarmSystem.Log,Logger,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Log\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAINLOGGER
Deficient Encapsulation,EarlyAlarmSystem.Log,Logger,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Log\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MAINLOGGER
Deficient Encapsulation,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,EmailSMSHandler,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\EmailSMSHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MasterMessagesHandler
Deficient Encapsulation,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,EmailSMSHandler,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\EmailSMSHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MasterMessagesHandler
Deficient Encapsulation,EarlyAlarmSystem.Network,NetworkPacket,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Network\NetworkPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NetworkPacketSectionID' AmbientTemp1' AmbientTemp2' HumiditySensor' WaterShellerOnOffMotor' HeliumCompressorOnOffMotor' HeliumCompressorInWaterTemperature' HeliumCompressorOutWaterTemperature' HeliumCompressorFlowOfWaterOnOff' SolinoidValveOnWaterShillerStatus' SystemPowerOnOff' RTC' TechnicalAlarm' SiteIdentifier' PhaseStatus
Wide Hierarchy,EarlyAlarmSystem.Alarms,AlarmBase,C:\repos\momenh_ge.eas\server\Early Alarm System\Code\Alarms\AlarmBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: PhaseAlarm' SystemPowerAlarm' AmbTemp1Alarm' AmbTemp2Alarm' DoorAlarm' HeliumCompressorAlarm' HumidityAlarm' SiteOfflineAlarm' WaterChillerAlarm' WaterFlowAlarm' WaterInTemp' WaterOutTemprature' WaterSolinoidValveAlarm
