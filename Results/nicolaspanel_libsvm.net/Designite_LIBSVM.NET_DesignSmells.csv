Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System,CommonHelpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaspanel_libsvm.net\LIBSVM\Helpers\CommonHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,libsvm,KernelHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaspanel_libsvm.net\LIBSVM\Helpers\KernelHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: libsvm.KernelHelper' libsvm.Kernel
Broken Hierarchy,libsvm,C_SVC,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaspanel_libsvm.net\LIBSVM\SVC\C_SVC.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): libsvm.SVC
Broken Hierarchy,libsvm,Epsilon_SVR,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaspanel_libsvm.net\LIBSVM\SVR\Epsilon_SVR.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): libsvm.SVR
