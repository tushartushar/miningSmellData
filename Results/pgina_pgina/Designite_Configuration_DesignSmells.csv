Duplicate Abstraction,pGina.Configuration,ConfigurationUI,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\ConfigurationUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConfigurationUI (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\ConfigurationUI.cs' [1' 28])' CredProvFilterConfig (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\CredProvFilterConfig.cs' [1' 28])
Duplicate Abstraction,pGina.Configuration,ConfigurationUI,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\ConfigurationUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConfigurationUI (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\ConfigurationUI.cs' [3' 28])' Program (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\Program.cs' [3' 28])
Duplicate Abstraction,pGina.Configuration,CredProvFilterConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\CredProvFilterConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Unnecessary Abstraction,pGina.Configuration.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,pGina.Configuration,ConfigurationUI,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\ConfigurationUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 82 methods
Insufficient Modularization,pGina.Configuration,ConfigurationUI,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\pGina\src\Configuration\ConfigurationUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 189
