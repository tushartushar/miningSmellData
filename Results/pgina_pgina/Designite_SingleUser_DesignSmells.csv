Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,pGina.Plugin.SingleUser,PluginImpl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\PluginImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PluginImpl (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\PluginImpl.cs' [1' 30])' Settings (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\Settings.cs' [1' 30])
Feature Envy,pGina.Plugin.SingleUser,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Init which is more interested in members of the type: pGinaDynamicSettings
Deficient Encapsulation,pGina.Plugin.SingleUser,PluginImpl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\PluginImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PluginUuid
Deficient Encapsulation,pGina.Plugin.SingleUser,PluginImpl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\PluginImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PluginUuid
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,pGina.Plugin.SingleUser,PluginImpl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\PluginImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: pGina.Plugin.SingleUser.PluginImpl' pGina.Plugin.SingleUser.Settings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,pGina.Plugin.SingleUser,Configuration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pgina_pgina\Plugins\Core\SingleUser\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: pGina.Plugin.SingleUser.Configuration' pGina.Plugin.SingleUser.PluginImpl' pGina.Plugin.SingleUser.Settings
