Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.Contextual,ContextualLifestyle,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Contextual\ContextualLifestyle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridLifestyleManager,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridLifestyleManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridScopeAccessor,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridScopeAccessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,PerWebRequestLifestyleModuleUtils,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\PerWebRequestLifestyleModuleUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsInitialized' InitializedFieldInfo
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,TransientScopeAccessor,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\TransientScopeAccessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Registration,LifestyleRegistrationExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\LifestyleRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.Contextual,ContainerContext,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Contextual\ContainerContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ContainerContext' IContainerContextStore
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.Contextual,ContextualLifestyle,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Contextual\ContextualLifestyle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridLifestyleManager,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridLifestyleManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Resolve
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridPerWebRequestPerThreadScopeAccessor,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridPerWebRequestPerThreadScopeAccessor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HybridPerWebRequestScopeAccessor
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridPerWebRequestTransientScopeAccessor,D:\newReposJune17\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridPerWebRequestTransientScopeAccessor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HybridPerWebRequestScopeAccessor
