(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridLifestyleManager<M1;M2>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridLifestyleManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,HybridScopeAccessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\HybridScopeAccessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle,PerWebRequestLifestyleModuleUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\PerWebRequestLifestyleModuleUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsInitialized' InitializedFieldInfo
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MicroKernel.Registration,LifestyleRegistrationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\LifestyleRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.Contextual,ContainerContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Castle.Windsor.Lifestyles\Contextual\ContainerContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.Contextual.ContainerContext' Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.Contextual.ContainerContextStore
