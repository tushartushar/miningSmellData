Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,FileBufferingReadStreamTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities.Tests\FileBufferingReadStreamTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartReaderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities.Tests\MultipartReaderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities.Test,HttpResponseStreamWriterTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities.Tests\HttpResponseStreamWriterTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,NonSeekableReadStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities.Tests\NonSeekableReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
