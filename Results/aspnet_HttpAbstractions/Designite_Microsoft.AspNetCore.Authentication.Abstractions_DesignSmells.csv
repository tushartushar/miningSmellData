Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,AuthenticationHttpContextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\AuthenticationHttpContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,AuthenticationToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\AuthenticationToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,IAuthenticationFeature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\IAuthenticationFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OriginalPathBase' OriginalPath
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,IAuthenticationFeature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\IAuthenticationFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,AuthenticationTokenExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\TokenExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,AuthenticationHttpContextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\AuthenticationHttpContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication,AuthenticationScheme,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Abstractions\AuthenticationScheme.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationScheme' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.IAuthenticationHandler
