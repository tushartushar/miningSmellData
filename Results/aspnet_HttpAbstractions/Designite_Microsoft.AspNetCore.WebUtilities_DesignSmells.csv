Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,Base64UrlTextEncoder,C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\Base64UrlTextEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,BufferedReadStream,C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\BufferedReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BufferedReadStream (C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\BufferedReadStream.cs' [111' 133])' MultipartReaderStream (C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartReaderStream.cs' [99' 121])

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartSection,C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ContentType' ContentDisposition' Headers' Body' BaseStreamOffset
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,FileBufferingReadStream,C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\FileBufferingReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write' WriteAsync' SetLength' Flush
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartReaderStream,C:\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartReaderStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
