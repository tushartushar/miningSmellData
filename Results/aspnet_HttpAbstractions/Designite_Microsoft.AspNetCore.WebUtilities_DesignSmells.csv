Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,Base64UrlTextEncoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\Base64UrlTextEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,FileBufferingReadStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\FileBufferingReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,FileMultipartSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\FileMultipartSection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FileMultipartSection which is more interested in members of the type: ContentDispositionHeaderValue
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,FormReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\FormReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,HttpRequestStreamReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\HttpRequestStreamReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,HttpRequestStreamReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\HttpRequestStreamReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HttpRequestStreamReader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\HttpRequestStreamReader.cs' [141' 161])' HttpRequestStreamReader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\HttpRequestStreamReader.cs' [204' 224])
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,HttpResponseStreamWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\HttpResponseStreamWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ContentType' ContentDisposition' Headers' Body' BaseStreamOffset
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartSectionConverterExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartSectionConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartSectionStreamExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartSectionStreamExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,QueryHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\QueryHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,ReasonPhrases,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\ReasonPhrases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,StreamHelperExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\StreamHelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ContentType' ContentDisposition' Headers' Body' BaseStreamOffset
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,FileBufferingReadStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\FileBufferingReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write' WriteAsync' SetLength' Flush
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities,MultipartReaderStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_HttpAbstractions\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebUtilities\MultipartReaderStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
