Unutilized Abstraction,Spring.Testing.Microsoft,AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.Microsoft.Tests\Testing\Microsoft\AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Spring.Testing.Microsoft,AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.Microsoft.Tests\Testing\Microsoft\AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UnregistersFromContextRegistryWhenDirty which is more interested in members of the type: TestAbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests
