Unutilized Abstraction,Spring.Web.Mvc.Tests,ControllerFactoryTestExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\ControllerFactoryTestExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spring.Web.Mvc.Tests,SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Duplicate Abstraction,Spring.Web.Mvc.Tests,SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests.cs' [1' 20])' FirstContainerRegisteredController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\Controllers\FirstContainerRegisteredController.cs' [1' 20])' NamedContextController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\Controllers\NamedContextController.cs' [1' 20])' NotInContainerController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\Controllers\NotInContainerController.cs' [1' 20])' SecondContainerRegisteredController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\Controllers\SecondContainerRegisteredController.cs' [1' 20])
Feature Envy,Spring.Web.Mvc.Tests,SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\SpringMvcDependencyResolverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CanUseNamedContextToResolveType which is more interested in members of the type: SpringMvcDependencyResolver

Unnecessary Abstraction,Spring.Web.Mvc.Tests.Controllers,FirstContainerRegisteredController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Web.Mvc5.Tests\Controllers\FirstContainerRegisteredController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestValue
