Unutilized Abstraction,Spring.Testing.Ado,SimpleAdoTestUtilsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\Testing\Ado\SimpleAdoTestUtilsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Spring.Testing.Ado,SimpleAdoTestUtilsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\Testing\Ado\SimpleAdoTestUtilsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SimpleAdoTestUtilsTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\Testing\Ado\SimpleAdoTestUtilsTests.cs' [1' 20])' AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\Testing\NUnit\AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests.cs' [1' 20])

Feature Envy,Spring.Testing.NUnit,AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\Testing\NUnit\AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UnregistersFromContextRegistryWhenDirty which is more interested in members of the type: TestAbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests

Broken Hierarchy,Spring,NUnitCompilerOptionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\NUnitCompilerOptionsTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Spring.CompilerOptionsTests
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spring.Testing.NUnit,TestAbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsExceptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spring-projects_spring-net\test\Spring\Spring.Testing.NUnit.Tests\Testing\NUnit\AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTestsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnSetUp' OnTearDown
