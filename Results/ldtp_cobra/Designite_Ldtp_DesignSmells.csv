Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Ldtp,ILdtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILdtp (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs' [6' 29])' LdtpExecutionError (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\LdtpExecutionError.cs' [5' 28])
Unutilized Abstraction,Ldtp,Ldtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Ldtp,Ldtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: windowName
Insufficient Modularization,Ldtp,ILdtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 136 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Ldtp,ILdtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 136
Insufficient Modularization,Ldtp,Ldtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 136 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Ldtp,Ldtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 140 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Ldtp,Ldtp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ldtp_cobra\Ldtp\Ldtp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 150
