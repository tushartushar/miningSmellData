Unnecessary Abstraction,Spark.Modules,IService,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\IService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Modules,IWebPackageManager,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\WebPackageManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Modules,WebPackageManager,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\WebPackageManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Modules.Html,BlockExtensions,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\Html\BlockExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spark.Modules,EmbeddedContentRouteHandler,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\EmbeddedContentRouteHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Spark.Modules.EmbeddedContentRouteHandler' Spark.Modules.EmbeddedContentHttpHandler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spark.Modules,EmbeddedContentHttpHandler,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\EmbeddedContentRouteHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Spark.Modules.EmbeddedContentHttpHandler' Spark.Modules.EmbeddedContentRouteHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Modules,WebPackageBase,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Spark.Modules\WebPackageBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Register
