Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreatedViewHasScriptProperty which is more interested in members of the type: PythonViewCompiler
Feature Envy,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CodeInheritsBaseClass which is more interested in members of the type: PythonViewCompiler

The method causing this smell is: TargetNamespace which is more interested in members of the type: PythonViewCompiler
Feature Envy,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TargetNamespaceWithUsingNamespaces which is more interested in members of the type: PythonViewCompiler
Feature Envy,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ViewDescriptorAttribute which is more interested in members of the type: PythonViewCompiler
Feature Envy,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ContainsGeneratedViewIdProperty which is more interested in members of the type: PythonViewCompiler
Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Python.Tests,ScriptingLanguageFactoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\ScriptingLanguageFactoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Python.Tests,ScriptingViewSymbolDictionaryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\ScriptingViewSymbolDictionaryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Spark.Python.Tests,PythonViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\PythonViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Python.Tests,TestView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python.Tests\ScriptingViewSymbolDictionaryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Render' TryGetViewData
