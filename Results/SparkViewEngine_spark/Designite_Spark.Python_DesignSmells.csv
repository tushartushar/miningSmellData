Unnecessary Abstraction,Spark.Python,IScriptingSparkView,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python\IScriptingSparkView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ScriptSource' CompiledCode
Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Python,ScriptingViewSymbolDictionary,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python\ScriptingViewSymbolDictionary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Python.Compiler.ChunkVisitors,GeneratedCodeVisitor,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python\Compiler\ChunkVisitors\GeneratedCodeVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Visit
Missing Hierarchy,Spark.Python,PythonLanguageFactory,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python\PythonLanguageFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: PythonViewCompiler' IScriptingSparkView (in method "InstanceCreated" of class "PythonLanguageFactory").
Missing Hierarchy,Spark.Python,PythonLanguageFactory,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python\PythonLanguageFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: PythonViewCompiler' IScriptingSparkView (in method "InstanceReleased" of class "PythonLanguageFactory").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Python,ScriptingViewSymbolDictionary,C:\repos\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Python\ScriptingViewSymbolDictionary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetExtraKeys
