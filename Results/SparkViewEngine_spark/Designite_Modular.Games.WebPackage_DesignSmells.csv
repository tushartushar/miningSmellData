Unutilized Abstraction,Modular.Games.WebPackage.Controllers,GridFlipController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Modular.Games.WebPackage\Controllers\GridFlipController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Modular.Games.WebPackage.Controllers,HomeController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Modular.Games.WebPackage\Controllers\HomeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Modular.Games.WebPackage.Models,Tile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Modular.Games.WebPackage\Models\HangmanGame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Letter' State
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Modular.Games.WebPackage.Controllers,HangmanController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Samples\Modules\Modular.Games.WebPackage\Controllers\HangmanController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Modular.Games.WebPackage.Controllers.HangmanController' Modular.Games.WebPackage.Controllers.HangmanGameRequiredAttribute
