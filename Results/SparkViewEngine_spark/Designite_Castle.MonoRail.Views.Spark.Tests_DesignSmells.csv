Feature Envy,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Tests,SparkBatchCompilerTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Tests\SparkBatchCompilerTester.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WildcardIncludeRules which is more interested in members of the type: SparkViewFactory
Feature Envy,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Tests,SparkBatchCompilerTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Tests\SparkBatchCompilerTester.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ControllersWithHelpersGenerateAccessors which is more interested in members of the type: SparkViewFactory
