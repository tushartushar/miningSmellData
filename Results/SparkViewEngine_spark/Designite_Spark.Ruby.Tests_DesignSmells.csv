Feature Envy,Spark.Ruby.Tests,RubyViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Ruby.Tests\RubyViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreatedViewHasScriptProperty which is more interested in members of the type: RubyViewCompiler

Insufficient Modularization,Spark.Ruby.Tests,RubyViewCompilerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Ruby.Tests\RubyViewCompilerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
