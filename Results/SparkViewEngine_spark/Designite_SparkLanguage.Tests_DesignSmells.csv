Unutilized Abstraction,SparkLanguage.Tests,ColorableTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Tools\SparkLanguage.Tests\ColorableTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SparkLanguage.Tests,SourceSupervisorTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Tools\SparkLanguage.Tests\SourceSupervisorTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SparkLanguage.Tests,SourceSupervisorTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Tools\SparkLanguage.Tests\SourceSupervisorTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SourceSupervisorTester (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Tools\SparkLanguage.Tests\SourceSupervisorTester.cs' [53' 84])' SourceSupervisorTester (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Tools\SparkLanguage.Tests\SourceSupervisorTester.cs' [112' 143])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SparkLanguage.Tests,Item,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Tools\SparkLanguage.Tests\SourceSupervisorTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
