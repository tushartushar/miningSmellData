Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,HelperExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\HelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkViewFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkViewFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetEngine which is more interested in members of the type: ISparkViewEngine
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Helpers,SparkJavascriptHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\Helpers\SparkJavascriptHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Install,DescribeBatchEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\Install\DescribeBatchEventHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Batch
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Install,PrecompileInstaller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\Install\PrecompileInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.Wrappers,IViewSourceLoaderContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\Wrappers\IViewSourceLoaderContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ViewSourceLoader
Unexploited Encapsulation,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,ViewComponentVisitor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\ViewComponentVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ElementNode' EndElementNode (in method "Accept" of class "ViewComponentVisitor").
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,HelperExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\HelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 59 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,HelperExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\HelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkViewFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkViewFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewFactory' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,ViewComponentContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\ViewComponentContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.ViewComponentContext' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewFactory' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.ViewComponentContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkViewData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkViewData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewData' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,ViewComponentContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\ViewComponentContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.ViewComponentContext' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkViewData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkViewData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewData' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkView' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.SparkViewFactory' Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark.ViewComponentContext
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark,SparkViewFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Castle.MonoRail.Views.Spark\SparkViewFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ProcessPartial' RenderStaticWithinLayout' CreateJSGenerator' GenerateJS
