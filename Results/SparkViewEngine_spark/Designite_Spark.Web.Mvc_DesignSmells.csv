Insufficient Modularization,Spark.Web.Mvc.Wrappers,HttpResponseWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Web.Mvc\Wrappers\HttpResponseWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Spark.Web.Mvc.Wrappers,HttpResponseWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Web.Mvc\Wrappers\HttpResponseWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Web.Mvc.Descriptors,DescriptorFilterBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Web.Mvc\Descriptors\DescriptorFilterBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExtraParameters' PotentialLocations
Cyclic Hierarchy,Spark.Web.Mvc.Descriptors,LanguageDescriptorFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Web.Mvc\Descriptors\LanguageDescriptorFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Delegated
Cyclic Hierarchy,Spark.Web.Mvc.Descriptors,ThemeDescriptorFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SparkViewEngine_spark\src\Spark.Web.Mvc\Descriptors\ThemeDescriptorFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy).
