(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NEventSocket.Examples.Examples,ChannelExample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\ChannelExample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NEventSocket.Examples.Examples,ChannelExample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\ChannelExample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ChannelExample (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\ChannelExample.cs' [228' 250])' ConferenceExample (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\ConferenceExample.cs' [105' 127])
Unutilized Abstraction,NEventSocket.Examples.Examples,ConferenceExample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\ConferenceExample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Feature Envy,NEventSocket.Examples.Examples,PlayGetDigitsExample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\PlayGetDigitsExample.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Run which is more interested in members of the type: InboundSocket
Unutilized Abstraction,NEventSocket.Examples.Examples,DtmfExample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danbarua_NEventSocket\src\NEventSocket.Examples\Examples\DtmfExample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
