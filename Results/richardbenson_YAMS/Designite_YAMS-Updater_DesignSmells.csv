Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,YAMS_Updater,frmDependencies,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Forms\frmDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: timCheckUpdate_Tick
Imperative Abstraction,YAMS_Updater,frmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Forms\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: timStatus_Tick
Deficient Encapsulation,YAMS_Updater,frmWorking,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Forms\frmWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lblCurrentItem' prgCurrentTask
Deficient Encapsulation,YAMS_Updater,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RootFolder
Deficient Encapsulation,YAMS_Updater,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RootFolder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,YAMS_Updater,frmFirstRun,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Forms\frmFirstRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: YAMS_Updater.frmFirstRun' YAMS_Updater.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,YAMS_Updater,frmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Forms\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: YAMS_Updater.frmMain' YAMS_Updater.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,YAMS_Updater,frmFirstRun,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richardbenson_YAMS\Source\YAMS-Updater\Forms\frmFirstRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: YAMS_Updater.frmFirstRun' YAMS_Updater.Program' YAMS_Updater.frmMain
