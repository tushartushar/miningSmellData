Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestTranslate which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRotate which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestScale which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestConcatenatedTransformations which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
