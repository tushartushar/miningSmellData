Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,DisplayObjectContainerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\DisplayObjectContainerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestTranslate which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRotate which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestScale which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Feature Envy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestConcatenatedTransformations which is more interested in members of the type: Matrix
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,RenderSupportTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\RenderSupportTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Broken Hierarchy,Tests,DisplayObjectTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\DisplayObjectTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tests.TestBase
Broken Hierarchy,Tests,MatrixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\MatrixTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tests.TestBase
Broken Hierarchy,Tests,VertexDataTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fmotagarcia_sparrow-sharp\UnitTests\Shared\VertexDataTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tests.TestBase
