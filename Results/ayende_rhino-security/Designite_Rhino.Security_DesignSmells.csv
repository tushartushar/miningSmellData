Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EntitySecurityKey' Type
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rhino.Security.Model,EntityType,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Model\EntityType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Security.Model,EqualityAndHashCodeProvider<T>,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Model\EqualityAndHashCodeProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Security.Model,NamedEntity<T>,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Model\NamedEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Security.Interfaces,IAuthorizationService,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Interfaces\IAuthorizationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rhino.Security.Interfaces,IIDentifiable,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Interfaces\IIDentifiable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Security.Interfaces,IIDentifiable,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Interfaces\IIDentifiable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Rhino.Security.Services,AuthorizationRepository,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Services\AuthorizationRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Rhino.Security.Services,AuthorizationRepository,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Services\AuthorizationRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rhino.Security.Services,PermissionsBuilderService,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Services\PermissionsBuilderService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rhino.Security.Services.PermissionsBuilderService' Rhino.Security.Services.FluentPermissionBuilder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rhino.Security.Services,FluentPermissionBuilder,C:\repos\ayende_rhino-security\Rhino.Security\Services\PermissionsBuilderService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rhino.Security.Services.FluentPermissionBuilder' Rhino.Security.Services.PermissionsBuilderService
