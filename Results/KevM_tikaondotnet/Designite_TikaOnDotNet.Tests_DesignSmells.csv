Unutilized Abstraction,TikaOnDotNet.Tests,sad_text_extraction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevM_tikaondotnet\src\TikaOnDotNet.Tests\sad-files\sad_text_extraction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,TikaOnDotNet.Tests,CustomResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevM_tikaondotnet\src\TikaOnDotNet.Tests\text_extraction_with_with_extraction_result_assembler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Text' Metadata
Insufficient Modularization,TikaOnDotNet.Tests,text_extraction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevM_tikaondotnet\src\TikaOnDotNet.Tests\text_extraction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
