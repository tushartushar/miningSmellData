Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,Chaos.NaCl-Portable,Chaos.NaCl.Internal,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Chaos.NaCl
Unstable Dependency,Chaos.NaCl-Portable,Chaos.NaCl.Internal.Ed25519Ref10,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Chaos.NaCl
Feature Concentration,Chaos.NaCl-Portable,Chaos.NaCl.Internal,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Array16' ByteIntegerConverter' Poly1305Donna' Sha512Internal]' [Array8]' [InternalAssert]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
Scattered Functionality,Chaos.NaCl-Portable,Chaos.NaCl,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Chaos.NaCl.Internal' Chaos.NaCl.Internal.Salsa
