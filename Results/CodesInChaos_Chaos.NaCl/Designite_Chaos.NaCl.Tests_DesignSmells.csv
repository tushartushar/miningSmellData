Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,ArrayTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\ArrayTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _testInput
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,ArrayTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\ArrayTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,CryptoBytesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\CryptoBytesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,Ed25519Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\Ed25519Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,Ed25519TestVectors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\Ed25519TestVectors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadTestCases
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,InternalAssertTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\InternalAssertTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,Poly1305Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\Poly1305Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,MontgomeryCurve25519Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\MontgomeryCurve25519Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,SalsaCoreTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\SalsaCoreTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,Sha512Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\Sha512Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,XSalsa20Poly1305Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\XSalsa20Poly1305Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,CryptoBytesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\CryptoBytesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 41 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,CryptoBytesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\CryptoBytesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Broken Modularization,Chaos.NaCl.Tests,MontgomeryCurve25519TestVectors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodesInChaos_Chaos.NaCl\Chaos.NaCl.Tests\MontgomeryCurve25519TestVectors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FrankPublicKey0' FrankPublicKey' AlicePrivateKey' AlicePublicKey' AlicePublicKey2' BobPrivateKey' BobPublicKey' AliceBobSharedKey' AliceFrankSharedKey' BobFrankSharedKey
