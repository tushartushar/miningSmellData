Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SpectralSpring.ModuleSupport,ModuleInitializationException,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\ModuleSupport\ModuleException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SpectralSpring.ModuleSupport.Ui,RibbonedMainWindowShell,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\ModuleSupport\Ui\RibbonedMainWindowShell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RibbonMainMenu
Unutilized Abstraction,SpectralSpring.Utils,MessageResourcesConfigurer,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\Utils\MessageResourcesConfigurer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SpectralSpring.Utils,ResourcesConfigurer,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\Utils\ResourcesConfigurer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SpectralSpring.Utils,UiCache,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\Utils\UiCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SpectralSpring.Utils,ResourceUtils,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\Utils\ResourceUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DEFAULT_IMAGE_URL
Deficient Encapsulation,SpectralSpring.Utils,ResourceUtils,C:\repos\bcostea_spectral-spring\Source\SpectralSpring\SpectralSpring\Utils\ResourceUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DEFAULT_IMAGE_URL
