Unnecessary Abstraction,Craft.Net.Anvil,IDiskEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\IDiskEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unutilized Abstraction,Craft.Net.Anvil,ReadOnlyNibbleArray,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\NibbleArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Craft.Net.Anvil,Region,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\Region.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Region (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\Region.cs' [84' 110])' Region (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\Region.cs' [131' 157])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Craft.Net.Anvil,TileEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\TileEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Coordinates' Id' X' Y' Z
Insufficient Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,Chunk,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\Chunk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,TileEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\TileEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Coordinates' Id' X' Y' Z
Insufficient Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,World,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\World.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,Chunk,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\Chunk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Anvil.Chunk' Craft.Net.Anvil.Region
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,IWorldGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\IWorldGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Anvil.IWorldGenerator' Craft.Net.Anvil.Level
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,World,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\World.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Anvil.World' Craft.Net.Anvil.Region
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,Chunk,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\Chunk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Anvil.Chunk' Craft.Net.Anvil.World' Craft.Net.Anvil.Region
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Anvil,IWorldGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Anvil\IWorldGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
