Unnecessary Abstraction,Craft.Net.Client,Profile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\Session.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,Craft.Net.Client,MojangUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\Session.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Properties
Unnecessary Abstraction,Craft.Net.Client,Userproperty,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\Session.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Value
Unexploited Encapsulation,Craft.Net.Client,ServerPing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\ServerPing.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: StatusResponsePacket' StatusPingPacket (in method "DoPing" of class "ServerPing").
Unexploited Encapsulation,Craft.Net.Client,MinecraftClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\MinecraftClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: DisconnectPacket' DisconnectPacket (in method "NetworkWorker" of class "MinecraftClient").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Client,MinecraftClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\MinecraftClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Client.MinecraftClient' Craft.Net.Client.Handlers.PacketHandlers
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Client,MinecraftClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Client\MinecraftClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
