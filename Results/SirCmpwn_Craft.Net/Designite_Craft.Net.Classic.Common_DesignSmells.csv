Duplicate Abstraction,Craft.Net.Classic.Common,MinecraftStream,C:\repos\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\MinecraftStream.Stream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MinecraftStream (C:\repos\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\MinecraftStream.Stream.cs' [24' 53])' BufferedStream (C:\repos\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\BufferedStream.cs' [36' 65])
