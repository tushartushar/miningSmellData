Unutilized Abstraction,Craft.Net.Classic.Common,MinecraftStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\MinecraftStream.Stream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Craft.Net.Classic.Common,MinecraftStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\MinecraftStream.Stream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MinecraftStream (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\MinecraftStream.Stream.cs' [24' 53])' BufferedStream (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\BufferedStream.cs' [36' 65])
Unutilized Abstraction,Craft.Net.Classic.Common,BufferedStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\BufferedStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,Craft.Net.Classic.Common,MinecraftStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Classic\Craft.Net.Classic.Common\MinecraftStream.Stream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
