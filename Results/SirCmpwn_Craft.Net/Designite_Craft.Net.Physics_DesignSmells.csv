Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Craft.Net.Physics,PhysicsEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Physics\PhysicsEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AdjustVelocityX which is more interested in members of the type: BoundingBox
Feature Envy,Craft.Net.Physics,PhysicsEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Physics\PhysicsEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AdjustVelocityY which is more interested in members of the type: BoundingBox
Feature Envy,Craft.Net.Physics,PhysicsEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Physics\PhysicsEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AdjustVelocityZ which is more interested in members of the type: BoundingBox
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Physics,IAABBEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Physics\IAABBEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Physics.IAABBEntity' Craft.Net.Physics.PhysicsEngine
