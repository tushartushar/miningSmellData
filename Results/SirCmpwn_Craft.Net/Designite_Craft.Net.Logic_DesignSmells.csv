Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Craft.Net.Logic,WorldExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\WorldExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Craft.Net.Logic,ObjectEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ObjectEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EntityType' Data
Deficient Encapsulation,Craft.Net.Logic,BlockInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\BlockInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BlockId' Metadata' SkyLight' BlockLight
Deficient Encapsulation,Craft.Net.Logic,ItemInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ItemInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ItemId' Metadata
Deficient Encapsulation,Craft.Net.Logic,ItemEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ItemEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PickupRange
Deficient Encapsulation,Craft.Net.Logic,ItemEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ItemEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PickupRange
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Logic,ItemEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ItemEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Logic.ItemEntity' Craft.Net.Logic.PlayerEntity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Logic,PlayerAbilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\PlayerAbilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Logic.PlayerAbilities' Craft.Net.Logic.PlayerEntity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Logic,Block,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\Block.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Logic.Block' Craft.Net.Logic.Item
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Craft.Net.Logic,ItemEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ItemEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Craft.Net.Logic.ItemEntity' Craft.Net.Logic.PlayerEntity' Craft.Net.Logic.PlayerAbilities
Broken Hierarchy,Craft.Net.Logic,LivingEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\LivingEntity.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Craft.Net.Logic.Entity
Broken Hierarchy,Craft.Net.Logic,ObjectEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\ObjectEntity.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Craft.Net.Logic.Entity
Wide Hierarchy,Craft.Net.Logic,Block,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\Block.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.GlassBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.AirBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.GrassBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.DirtBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.DecorativeGrassBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.TallGrassBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.WheatBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.YellowFlowerBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.FlowerBlock' Craft.Net.Logic.Blocks.LadderBlock
Cyclic Hierarchy,Craft.Net.Logic,Item,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Craft.Net\source\Craft.Net.Logic\Item.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Block
