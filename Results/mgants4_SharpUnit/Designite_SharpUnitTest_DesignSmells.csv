Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,Dummy_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Dummy_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestSetUp which is more interested in members of the type: Dummy
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,Dummy_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Dummy_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestTearDown which is more interested in members of the type: Dummy
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,Dummy_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Dummy_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestTestMethod which is more interested in members of the type: Dummy
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,Dummy_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Dummy_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRun which is more interested in members of the type: Dummy
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestCase_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestCase_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRun_InvalidTest which is more interested in members of the type: TestCase
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestCase_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestCase_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRun_NoParam which is more interested in members of the type: TestCase
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestCase_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestCase_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRun which is more interested in members of the type: TestCase
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestCase_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestCase_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestRun_Fail which is more interested in members of the type: TestCase
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestReporter_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestReporter_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestLogResults_NoParam which is more interested in members of the type: DummyReporter
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestResult_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestResult_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestTestStarted which is more interested in members of the type: TestResult
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestResult_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestResult_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestTestFailed which is more interested in members of the type: TestResult
Feature Envy,SharpUnitTest,TestResult_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\TestResult_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestGetSummary which is more interested in members of the type: TestResult
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpUnitTest,Dummy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Dummy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_wasRun' m_wasSetup' m_wasTornDown
Insufficient Modularization,SharpUnitTest,Assert_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Assert_Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,SharpUnitTest,Assert_Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\Assert_Test.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SharpUnit.TestCase
Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpUnitTest,DummyReporter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgants4_SharpUnit\SharpUnitTest\Tests\DummyReporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LogSummary
