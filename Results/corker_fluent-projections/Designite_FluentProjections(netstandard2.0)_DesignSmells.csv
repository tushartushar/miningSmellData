Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,AddNewProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\AddNewProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InsertAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ILog

Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,RemoveProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\RemoveProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RemoveAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ILog
Imperative Abstraction,FluentProjections.Strategies,SaveProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\SaveProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class.

Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,SaveProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\SaveProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ReadAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ILog
Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,SaveProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\SaveProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InsertAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ILog
Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,SaveProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\SaveProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ILog
Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,UpdateProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\UpdateProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.

Feature Envy,FluentProjections.Strategies,UpdateProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\UpdateProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateAsync which is more interested in members of the type: ILog
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FluentProjections.Strategies.Arguments,Filter<TMessage>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\Arguments\Filter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FluentProjections.Strategies.Arguments.Filter<TMessage>' FluentProjections.Strategies.Arguments.Filters<TMessage>
Rebellious Hierarchy,FluentProjections.Logging,NoOpLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Logging\LogProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Log' Log
Unfactored Hierarchy,FluentProjections.Logging.LogProviders,Log4NetLogProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Logging\LogProviders\Log4NetLogProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  Log4NetLogProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Logging\LogProviders\Log4NetLogProvider.cs' [46' 67])' NLogLogProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Logging\LogProviders\NLogLogProvider.cs' [49' 70])
Unfactored Hierarchy,FluentProjections.Strategies,SaveProjectionStrategy<TMessage;TProjection>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\SaveProjectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  SaveProjectionStrategy<TMessage'TProjection> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\SaveProjectionStrategy.cs' [91' 121])' UpdateProjectionStrategy<TMessage'TProjection> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\corker_fluent-projections\src\FluentProjections\Strategies\UpdateProjectionStrategy.cs' [70' 100])
