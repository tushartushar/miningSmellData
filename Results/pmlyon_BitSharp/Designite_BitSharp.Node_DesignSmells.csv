Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BitSharp.Node,EsentConfig,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CacheSizeMaxMebiBytes
Unutilized Abstraction,BitSharp.Node,EsentConfig,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BitSharp.Node,DevConfig,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SecondaryBlockFolder
Unutilized Abstraction,BitSharp.Node,DevConfig,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,BitSharp.Node,EsentConfig,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CacheSizeMaxMebiBytes
Broken Modularization,BitSharp.Node,NodeConfig,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PriorityClass' StorageType' ChainType' ConnectToPeers' ExecuteScripts' PruningMode
Broken Hierarchy,BitSharp.Node,NodeRpcServer,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.Node\NodeRpcServer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BitSharp.Core.JsonRpc.CoreRpcServer
