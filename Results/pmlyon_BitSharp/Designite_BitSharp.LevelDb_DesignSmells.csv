Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,BitSharp.LevelDb,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbBlockStorage,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\LevelDbBlockStorage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  LevelDbBlockStorage (C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\LevelDbBlockStorage.cs' [31' 50])' LevelDbBlockTxesStorage (C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\LevelDbBlockTxesStorage.cs' [32' 51])' LevelDbChainStateCursor (C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ChainState\LevelDbChainStateCursor.cs' [488' 507])' LevelDbChainStateCursor (C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ChainState\LevelDbChainStateCursor.cs' [531' 550])
Unutilized Abstraction,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbStorageModule,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\LevelDbStorageModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BitSharp.LevelDb,PersistentObjectDictonary<TKey;TValue>,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\PersistentObjectDictonary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbChainStateCursor,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ChainState\LevelDbChainStateCursor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbChainStateCursor,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ChainState\LevelDbChainStateCursor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbBlockStorage,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\LevelDbBlockStorage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Defragment
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbBlockTxesStorage,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\LevelDbBlockTxesStorage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Defragment
Multipath Hierarchy,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbChainStateCursor,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ChainState\LevelDbChainStateCursor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IChainStateCursor
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitSharp.LevelDb,LevelDbChainStateCursor,C:\repos\pmlyon_BitSharp\BitSharp.LevelDb\ChainState\LevelDbChainStateCursor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Defragment
