Unutilized Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,FMain,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\FMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,FMain,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\FMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FMain (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\FMain.cs' [4' 28])' GhostscriptStdIOHandler (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs' [4' 28])' Program (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs' [4' 28])
Duplicate Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,GhostscriptStdIOHandler,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GhostscriptStdIOHandler (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs' [4' 29])' Program (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs' [4' 29])
Duplicate Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,GhostscriptStdIOHandler,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GhostscriptStdIOHandler (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs' [3' 22])' Program (C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs' [3' 22])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,FDebug,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\FDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: txtDebug
Deficient Encapsulation,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,Program,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NAME
Deficient Encapsulation,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,Program,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NAME
Rebellious Hierarchy,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,GhostscriptStdIOHandler,C:\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StdIn
