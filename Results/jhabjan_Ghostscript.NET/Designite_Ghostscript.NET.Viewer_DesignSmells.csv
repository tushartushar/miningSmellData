Duplicate Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,GhostscriptStdIOHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GhostscriptStdIOHandler (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs' [3' 22])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs' [3' 22])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,FDebug,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\FDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: txtDebug
Deficient Encapsulation,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NAME
Deficient Encapsulation,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NAME
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,FMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\FMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ghostscript.NET.Viewer.FMain' Ghostscript.NET.Viewer.Program
Rebellious Hierarchy,Ghostscript.NET.Viewer,GhostscriptStdIOHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jhabjan_Ghostscript.NET\Ghostscript.NET.Viewer\GhostscriptStdIOHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StdIn
