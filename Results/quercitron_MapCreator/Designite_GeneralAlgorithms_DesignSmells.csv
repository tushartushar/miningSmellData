Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,NPack,MersenneTwister,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\GeneralAlgorithms\RandomGenerator\MersenneTwisterGenerator\MersenneTwister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.98
Unutilized Abstraction,GeneralAlgorithms.Sorting,Sort,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\GeneralAlgorithms\Sorting\QuickSort.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GeneralAlgorithms.GeometryBase,Geometry,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\GeneralAlgorithms\GeometryBase\Geometry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Geometry' Point2D
Rebellious Hierarchy,GeneralAlgorithms.RandomGenerator,BaseRandomGenerator,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\GeneralAlgorithms\RandomGenerator\RandomGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Next' Next' NextDouble
