Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Triangulation.MapObjects,Corner,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapObjects\Corner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Corner' Border' Polygon
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Triangulation.MapObjects,Corner,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapObjects\Corner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Corner' Polygon' Border' Polygon
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Triangulation.MapObjects,Corner,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapObjects\Corner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Corner' Border' Polygon' Border' Polygon
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Triangulation.MapObjects,Border,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapObjects\Border.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Border' Polygon
Broken Modularization,Triangulation.MapPainter,DrawSettings,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapPainter\DrawSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DisplayPolygons' DisplayCoast' DisplayRivers' DisplayElevation' DisplayMoisture' DisplayLinealBorders' DisplayNoiseBorders' ApplyNoise' DisplayLakes' DisplayCoastline
Wide Hierarchy,Triangulation.MapBuilding,IMapBuilderComponent,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapBuilding\IMapBuilderComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AssignCoastBuilderComponent' CalculateDistanceFromEdgeBuilderComponent' DefineOcean' BaseElevationGenerator' StructureLakes' ImprovedPerlinNoiseLandGenerator' PerlinNoiseLandGenerator' SkeletonLandGenerator' MoistureGenerator' FormPolygons' BaseRivers' SetTerranTypeFromSite
Rebellious Hierarchy,Triangulation.MapBuilding.Elevation,BaseElevationGenerator,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapBuilding\Elevation\BaseElevationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Build
Broken Hierarchy,Triangulation.MapBuilding.Polygons,MapPoint,C:\repos\quercitron_MapCreator\Triangulation\MapBuilding\Polygons\MapPoint.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Point2D
