Unutilized Abstraction,MongoMembership.Providers,MongoMembershipProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Providers\MongoMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MongoMembership.Providers,MongoMembershipProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Providers\MongoMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateAndReturn which is more interested in members of the type: IMongoGateway
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoMembership.Providers,MongoProfileProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Providers\MongoProfileProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoMembership.Providers,MongoRoleProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Providers\MongoRoleProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MongoMembership,Role,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Role.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ApplicationName' RoleName' RoleNameLowercased
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoMembership.Utils,SecurityExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Utils\SecurityExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MongoMembership.Utils,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Utils\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MongoMembership.Mongo,MongoGateway,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Mongo\MongoGateway.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MongoMembership.Mongo,MongoGateway,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Mongo\MongoGateway.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MongoMembership.Providers,MongoRoleProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FoC-_MongoMembership\MongoMembership\Providers\MongoRoleProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FindUsersInRole' GetAllRoles' GetRolesForUser' GetUsersInRole' IsUserInRole' RoleExists
