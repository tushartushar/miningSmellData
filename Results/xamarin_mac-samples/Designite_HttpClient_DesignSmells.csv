Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,HttpClient,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,HttpClient,NetHttp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\NetworkHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HttpSample which is more interested in members of the type: ViewController
Feature Envy,HttpClient,DotNet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\NetworkHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FeedDownloaded which is more interested in members of the type: ViewController
Feature Envy,HttpClient,DotNet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\NetworkHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GmailDownloaded which is more interested in members of the type: ViewController
Unutilized Abstraction,HttpClient,AcceptingPolicy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\NetworkHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HttpClient,ProtocolTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\ProtocolTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpClient,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HttpClient.ViewController' HttpClient.NetHttp
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpClient,DotNet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\NetworkHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HttpClient.DotNet' HttpClient.ViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpClient,Cocoa,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\HttpClient\HttpClient\NetworkHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HttpClient.Cocoa' HttpClient.ViewController
