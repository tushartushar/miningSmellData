Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MacCustomControl,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacCustomControl\MacCustomControl\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MacCustomControl,ViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacCustomControl\MacCustomControl\ViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MacCustomControl,NSFlipSwitch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacCustomControl\MacCustomControl\Classes\NSFlipSwitch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UIKit,UIColor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacCustomControl\MacCustomControl\UIKit\UIColor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UIKit.UIColor' UIKit.UIStringAttributes' UIKit.UIStringDrawing
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UIKit,NSShadow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacCustomControl\MacCustomControl\UIKit\NSShadow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UIKit.NSShadow' UIKit.UIStringAttributes' UIKit.UIStringDrawing' UIKit.UIColor
Rebellious Hierarchy,MacCustomControl,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacCustomControl\MacCustomControl\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DidFinishLaunching' WillTerminate
