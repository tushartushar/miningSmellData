Deficient Encapsulation,AppKit,SourceListDataSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacControls\MacControls\Sourcelist\SourceListDataSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Items
Insufficient Modularization,AppKit,SourceListItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacControls\MacControls\Sourcelist\SourceListItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AppKit,SourceListDataSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacControls\MacControls\Sourcelist\SourceListDataSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AppKit.SourceListDataSource' AppKit.SourceListView
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AppKit,SourceListDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacControls\MacControls\Sourcelist\SourceListDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AppKit.SourceListDelegate' AppKit.SourceListView
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AppKit,SourceListDataSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacControls\MacControls\Sourcelist\SourceListDataSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AppKit.SourceListDataSource' AppKit.SourceListView' AppKit.SourceListDelegate
Rebellious Hierarchy,MacControls,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacControls\MacControls\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DidFinishLaunching' WillTerminate
