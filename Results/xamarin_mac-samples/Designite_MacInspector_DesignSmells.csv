Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MacInspector,ContentViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacInspector\MacInspector\ContentViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MacInspector.ContentViewController' MacInspector.MainSplitViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MacInspector,InspectorViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacInspector\MacInspector\InspectorViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MacInspector.InspectorViewController' MacInspector.MainSplitViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MacInspector,ContentViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mac-samples\MacInspector\MacInspector\ContentViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
