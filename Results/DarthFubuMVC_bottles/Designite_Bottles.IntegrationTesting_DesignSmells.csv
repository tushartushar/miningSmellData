Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,AssemblyPackageTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\AssemblyPackageTester.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: re_explode_based_on_a_newer_assembly_version which is more interested in members of the type: BottleLoadingDomain
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,ProcessReturn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\ProcessReturn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OutputText' ExitCode
Deficient Encapsulation,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,IntegrationTestContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\IntegrationTestContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SolutionDirectory' StagingDirectory' SourceDirectory' ZipsDirectory
Deficient Encapsulation,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,IntegrationTestContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\IntegrationTestContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SolutionDirectory' StagingDirectory' SourceDirectory' ZipsDirectory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,BottleDomainProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\BottleDomainProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Bottles.IntegrationTesting.BottleDomainProxy' Bottles.IntegrationTesting.BottleLoadingDomain' Bottles.IntegrationTesting.IntegrationTestContext
Broken Hierarchy,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,AssemblyPackageTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\AssemblyPackageTester.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Bottles.IntegrationTesting.IntegrationTestContext
Broken Hierarchy,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,LinkedFolderPackageTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\LinkedFolderPackageTester.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Bottles.IntegrationTesting.IntegrationTestContext
Broken Hierarchy,Bottles.IntegrationTesting,ZipPackageTesting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarthFubuMVC_bottles\src\Bottles.IntegrationTesting\ZipPackageTesting.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Bottles.IntegrationTesting.IntegrationTestContext
