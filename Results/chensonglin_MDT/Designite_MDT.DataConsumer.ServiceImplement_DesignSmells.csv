Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement,DataConsumerService,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement\DataConsumerService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Duplicate Abstraction,MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement.DataConsumerCenter,Source,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataConsumerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Source[209' 233]' Source[333' 357]
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement.DataConsumerCenter,IDataConsumerCenterServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataConsumerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement.EmailCenter,IEmailCenterServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement\Service References\EmailCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement.TraceLogCenter,ITraceLogCenterServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement\Service References\TraceLogCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Rebellious Hierarchy,MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement,DataConsumerService,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataConsumer.ServiceImplement\DataConsumerService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReSend
