Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.Utility,LogMessageEntity,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.Utility\FormatLogMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Direction' DetailErroMsg' TaskName' CommandName' Message
Duplicate Abstraction,MDT.Utility,HttpRequestUtils,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.Utility\HttpRequestUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HttpRequestUtils[124' 148]' HttpRequestUtils[198' 222]
