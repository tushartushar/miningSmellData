Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement,DataProducerService,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\DataProducerService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Multifaceted Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement,DataProducerService,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\DataProducerService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.DataConsumer,IDataConsumerServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataConsumer\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.DataProducerCenter,Source,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataProducerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Source[209' 233]' Source[333' 357]
Duplicate Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.DataProducerCenter,Source,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataProducerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Source[521' 545]' Source[753' 777]
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.DataProducerCenter,RelatedTable,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataProducerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ForeignColumn' ForeignColumnField
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.DataProducerCenter,IDataProducerCenterServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataProducerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.EmailCenter,IEmailCenterServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\EmailCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.TraceLogCenter,ITraceLogCenterServiceChannel,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\TraceLogCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Rebellious Hierarchy,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement,DataTransformService,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\DataTransformService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReSend
Cyclic Hierarchy,MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement.DataProducerCenter,Table,C:\repos\chensonglin_MDT\MDT.DataProducer.ServiceImplement\Service References\DataProducerCenter\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: RelatedTable
