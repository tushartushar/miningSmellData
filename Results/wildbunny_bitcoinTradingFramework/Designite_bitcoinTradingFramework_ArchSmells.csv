Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,bitcoinTradingFramework,bitcoinTradingFramework.Algorithms,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: bitcoinTradingFramework.Algorithms' bitcoinTradingFramework,bitcoinTradingFramework.Algorithms.AlgoBase' bitcoinTradingFramework.Program
Unstable Dependency,bitcoinTradingFramework,bitcoinTradingFramework,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): bitcoinTradingFramework.Algorithms,bitcoinTradingFramework.AlgoBase
Scattered Functionality,bitcoinTradingFramework,bitcoinTradingFramework.Algorithms,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: HuobiApi' bitcoinTradingFramework,HuobiApi.IMarket' bitcoinTradingFramework.Rendering' HuobiApi.UnixTime' HuobiApi.HuobiMarketSummary' HuobiApi.MarketBase
