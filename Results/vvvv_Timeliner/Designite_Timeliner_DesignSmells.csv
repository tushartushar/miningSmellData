Rebellious Hierarchy,Timeliner,SvgMenuWidget,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\SvgWidgets\SvgMenuWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose
Rebellious Hierarchy,Timeliner,AudioTrackView,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\AudioTrackView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Evaluate
Broken Hierarchy,Timeliner,TLViewBaseTyped<TModel;TParent>,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\BaseClasses.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Timeliner.TLViewBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,Timeliner,KeyframeView,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\KeyframeView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UnbuildSVG' BuildSVG
Rebellious Hierarchy,Timeliner,TimelineView,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\TimelinerView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BuildSVG
Missing Hierarchy,Timeliner,TimelineView,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\TimelinerView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IMouseEventHandler' TrackView (in method "GetMouseHandler" of class "TimelineView").
Cyclic Hierarchy,Timeliner,TrackView,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\TrackView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: StringTrackView
Cyclic Hierarchy,Timeliner,TrackView,C:\repos\vvvv_Timeliner\Source\View\TrackView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ValueTrackView
