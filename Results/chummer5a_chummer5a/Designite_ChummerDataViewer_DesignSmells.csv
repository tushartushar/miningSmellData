Imperative Abstraction,ChummerDataViewer.Model,CrashReport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Model\CrashReport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: StartDownload
Feature Envy,ChummerDataViewer.Model,CrashReport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Model\CrashReport.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WorkerOnStatusChanged which is more interested in members of the type: DatabasePrivateApi
Imperative Abstraction,ChummerDataViewer.Model,DynamoDbLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Model\DynamoDbLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unnecessary Abstraction,ChummerDataViewer.Model,INotifyThreadStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Model\DynamoDbLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,ChummerDataViewer.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ChummerDataViewer.Model,CrashReport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Model\CrashReport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ChummerDataViewer.Model.CrashReport' ChummerDataViewer.Model.Database
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ChummerDataViewer.Model,PersistentState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chummer5a_chummer5a\ChummerDataViewer\Model\PersistentState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ChummerDataViewer.Model.PersistentState' ChummerDataViewer.Model.Database
