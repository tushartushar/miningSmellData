Unutilized Abstraction,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Player (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs' [1' 20])' Playlist (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Playlist.cs' [1' 20])
Feature Envy,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SeekToTime which is more interested in members of the type: BassAudioEngine
Feature Envy,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: bass_PlaybackProgress which is more interested in members of the type: ControlQueryManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,PandoraSharpPlayer,PlaylistEmptyException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Playlist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PandoraSharpPlayer,Player,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\PandoraSharpPlayer\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 113
