Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,HttpMachine,HttpParser,F:\newReposMay17\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\kayak\lib\httpmachine\src\HttpMachine\HttpParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Duplicate Abstraction,HttpMachine,HttpParser,F:\newReposMay17\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\kayak\lib\httpmachine\src\HttpMachine\HttpParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HttpParser[942' 969]' HttpParser[991' 1018]
Insufficient Modularization,HttpMachine,HttpParser,F:\newReposMay17\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\kayak\lib\httpmachine\src\HttpMachine\HttpParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 169
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMachine,HttpParser,F:\newReposMay17\adammhaile_Elpis\Libs\kayak\lib\httpmachine\src\HttpMachine\HttpParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HttpParser' IHttpParserDelegate
