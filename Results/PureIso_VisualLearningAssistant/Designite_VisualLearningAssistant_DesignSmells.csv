Duplicate Abstraction,VisualLearningAssistant,About,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\About.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: About[1' 22]' App[1' 22]' MainWindow[1' 22]' Option[1' 22]' SplashScreen[1' 22]' PluginService[1' 22]
Multifaceted Abstraction,VisualLearningAssistant,MainWindow,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Duplicate Abstraction,VisualLearningAssistant,Option,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\Option.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Option[80' 101]' Option[133' 154]
Unutilized Abstraction,VisualLearningAssistant,SplashScreen,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\SplashScreen.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,VisualLearningAssistant.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,VisualLearningAssistant,App,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,VisualLearningAssistant,App,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Instance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VisualLearningAssistant,About,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\About.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: About' MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VisualLearningAssistant,About,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\About.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: About' MainWindow' Option' MainWindow
Insufficient Modularization,VisualLearningAssistant,MainWindow,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,VisualLearningAssistant,MainWindow,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 101
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VisualLearningAssistant,MainWindow,C:\repos\PureIso_VisualLearningAssistant\VisualLearningAssistant\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainWindow' Option
