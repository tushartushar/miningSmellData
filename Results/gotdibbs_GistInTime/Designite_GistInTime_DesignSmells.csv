Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' IsSetup' AuthToken' AuthTokenId' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,GistInTime.Model,AuthorizationResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gotdibbs_GistInTime\GistInTime\Model\AuthorizationResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: id' url' scopes' token' app' note' note_url' updated_at' created_at
Broken Modularization,GistInTime.Model,GistsResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gotdibbs_GistInTime\GistInTime\Model\GistsResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: url' forks_url' commits_url' id' git_pull_url' git_push_url' html_url' files' public' created_at' updated_at' description' comments' user' owner' comments_url' updated_at_display' first_file_name
Broken Modularization,GistInTime.Model,GithubScope,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gotdibbs_GistInTime\GistInTime\Model\GithubScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' User' UserEmail' UserFollow' PublicRepo' Repo' RepoStatus' DeleteRepo' Notifications' Gist
Broken Modularization,GistInTime.Model,User,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gotdibbs_GistInTime\GistInTime\Model\User.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.

Broken Modularization,GistInTime.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gotdibbs_GistInTime\GistInTime\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' IsSetup' AuthToken' AuthTokenId' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GistInTime,SettingsDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gotdibbs_GistInTime\GistInTime\SettingsDialog.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GistInTime.SettingsDialog' GistInTime.App
