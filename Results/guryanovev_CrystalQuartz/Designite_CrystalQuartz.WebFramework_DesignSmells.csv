Unnecessary Abstraction,CrystalQuartz.WebFramework.Commands,CommandResult,F:\newReposMay17\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.WebFramework\Commands\CommandResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Success' ErrorMessage
Unnecessary Abstraction,CrystalQuartz.WebFramework.HttpAbstractions,IRequest,F:\newReposMay17\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.WebFramework\HttpAbstractions\IRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CrystalQuartz.WebFramework.Utils,ExceptionHelper,F:\newReposMay17\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.WebFramework\Utils\ExceptionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclic Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.WebFramework.Config,AbstractHandlerConfig,F:\newReposMay17\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.WebFramework\Config\HandlerConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ConsHandlerConfig
Broken Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.WebFramework.Config,EmptyHandlerConfig,F:\newReposMay17\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.WebFramework\Config\HandlerConfig.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractHandlerConfig
Broken Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.WebFramework.Config,ConsHandlerConfig,F:\newReposMay17\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.WebFramework\Config\HandlerConfig.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractHandlerConfig
