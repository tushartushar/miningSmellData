Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CrystalQuartz.Stubs,SchedulerHostStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Stubs\SchedulerHostStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,CrystalQuartz.Stubs,SchedulerCommanderStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Stubs\SchedulerCommanderStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.Stubs,SchedulerClerkStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Stubs\SchedulerClerkStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetSchedulerData' GetJobDetailsData' GetSchedulerDetails' GetTriggerDetailsData
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.Stubs,SchedulerCommanderStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Stubs\SchedulerCommanderStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DeleteJobGroup' DeleteJob' DeleteTrigger' ExecuteNow' PauseAllJobs' PauseJobGroup' PauseJob' PauseTrigger' ResumeAllJobs' ResumeJobGroup' ResumeJob' ResumeTrigger' StandbyScheduler' StartScheduler' StopScheduler
