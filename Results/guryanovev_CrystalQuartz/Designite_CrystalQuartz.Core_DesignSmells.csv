Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CrystalQuartz.Core.Utils,DateTimeOffsetExtensions,C:\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Core\Utils\DateTimeOffsetExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,CrystalQuartz.Core.Domain,SchedulerData,C:\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Core\Domain\SchedulerData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' InstanceId' IsStarted' CanStart' CanShutdown' JobGroups' TriggerGroups' Status' JobsTotal' JobsExecuted' IsRemote' SchedulerType' RunningSince
Broken Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.Core.Domain,TriggerData,C:\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Core\Domain\TriggerData.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CrystalQuartz.Core.Domain.Activity
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrystalQuartz.Core.SchedulerProviders,FuncSchedulerProvider,C:\repos\guryanovev_CrystalQuartz\src\CrystalQuartz.Core\SchedulerProviders\FuncSchedulerProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Init
