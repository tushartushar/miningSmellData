Unnecessary Abstraction,Blink1Control,IftttEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: blink1_id' name' source' date
Unnecessary Abstraction,Blink1Control,IftttResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: events' event_count' status
Deficient Encapsulation,Blink1Control,Blink1Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: startMinimized' logToScreen
Deficient Encapsulation,Blink1Control,Blink1Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: startMinimized' logToScreen
Deficient Encapsulation,Blink1Control,Blink1JSONFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: blink1Server' GetStringResponse
Deficient Encapsulation,Blink1Control,Blink1Input,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Input.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: iftttEventUrl' iftttLastTime' iftttUpdateInterval' iftttLastContent
Deficient Encapsulation,Blink1Control,Blink1Input,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Input.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: iftttEventUrl' iftttLastTime' iftttUpdateInterval' iftttLastContent
Insufficient Modularization,Blink1Control,Blink1Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Broken Modularization,Blink1Control.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' inputs' patterns' logToScreen' hostId' startMinimized' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Blink1Control,Blink1Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Blink1Control.Blink1Server' Blink1Control.Blink1Input
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Blink1Control,Blink1Pattern,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Pattern.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Blink1Control.Blink1Pattern' Blink1Control.Blink1Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Blink1Control,Blink1Input,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\Blink1Control\Blink1Control\Blink1Input.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Blink1Control.Blink1Input' Blink1Control.Blink1Server' Blink1Control.Blink1Pattern
