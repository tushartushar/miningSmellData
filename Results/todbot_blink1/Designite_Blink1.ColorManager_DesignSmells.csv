Imperative Abstraction,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,ColorManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: textBoxInactivityMillisecond_Validating
Duplicate Abstraction,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,ColorManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ColorManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorManager.cs' [89' 121])' frmMain (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\Main.cs' [23' 55])
Imperative Abstraction,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,PresetControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\PresetControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: textBoxDisplayMilisecond_Validating
Unutilized Abstraction,ColorChooserCSharp,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,RGB,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Red' Green' Blue
Deficient Encapsulation,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,HSV,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Hue' Saturation' value
Deficient Encapsulation,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,ColorWheel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorWheel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ColorChanged
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager,ColorManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\todbot_blink1\windows\ManagedBlink1\Blink1.ColorPicker\ColorManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager.ColorManager' ThingM.Blink1.ColorManager.PresetControl
