Insufficient Modularization,IronPigeon,Utilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_IronPigeon\src\IronPigeon\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,IronPigeon,Utilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_IronPigeon\src\IronPigeon\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IronPigeon,Endpoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_IronPigeon\src\IronPigeon\Endpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IronPigeon.Endpoint' IronPigeon.Utilities
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IronPigeon,Endpoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_IronPigeon\src\IronPigeon\Endpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
