Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider' Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Servers,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider.GraphQlRootSchema' Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider.RootProviderContainer' Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Servers.GraphQlServer
Unstable Dependency,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework.Query,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider.QueryBuilder
Unstable Dependency,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Servers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Servers.GraphQlExecuterProvider
Feature Concentration,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [GraphQlExecuterProvider' GraphQlRequest]' [GraphQlRootSchema' RootMutation' RootProviderContainer' RootQuery]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider.GraphQlExecuterProvider' Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.RootProvider.GraphQlRequest
