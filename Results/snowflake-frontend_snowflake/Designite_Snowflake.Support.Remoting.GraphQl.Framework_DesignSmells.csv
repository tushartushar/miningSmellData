Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework.Attributes,ParameterAttribute,C:\repos\snowflake-frontend_snowflake\src\Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework\Attributes\ParameterAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphQL.Relay.Types,ArraySliceMetrics<TSource;TParent>,C:\repos\snowflake-frontend_snowflake\src\Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework\Connections\ArraySliceMetrics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphQL.Relay.Utilities,EnumerableExtensions,C:\repos\snowflake-frontend_snowflake\src\Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework\Connections\EnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework.Query,FieldQuery,C:\repos\snowflake-frontend_snowflake\src\Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework\Query\FieldQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' Name' GraphType' Arguments' Resolver
Broken Modularization,Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework.Query,ConnectionQuery,C:\repos\snowflake-frontend_snowflake\src\Snowflake.Support.Remoting.GraphQl.Framework\Query\ConnectionQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' Name' GraphType' Arguments' ItemsType' ReturnType' Resolver
