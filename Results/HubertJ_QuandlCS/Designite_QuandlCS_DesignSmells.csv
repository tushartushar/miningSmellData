Broken Modularization,QuandlCS.Helpers,Constants,F:\newReposMay17\HubertJ_QuandlCS\QuandlCS\Helpers\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' APIMultisetsAddress' APIDatasetsAddress' APIDatasetsImportAddress' APIFavouritesAddress' APIColumns' APIAuthorization' APISortOrder' APIStartDate' APIEndDate' APITransformation' APIFrequency' APITruncation' APIHeader' APIExcludeData' APIQuery
Missing Hierarchy,QuandlCS.Connection,QuandlConnection,F:\newReposMay17\HubertJ_QuandlCS\QuandlCS\Connection\QuandlConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IQuandlRequest' IQuandlUploadRequest (in method "Request" of class "QuandlConnection").
