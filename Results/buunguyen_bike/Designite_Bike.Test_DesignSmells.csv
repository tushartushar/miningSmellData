Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Bike.Test,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,Generic<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\Generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\Person.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Bike.Test,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BikeNumber' BikeString (in method "ToClrType" of class "Extensions").
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\Person.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: action' staticAction
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\Person.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: staticAction
Insufficient Modularization,Bike.Test,TypeTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Interpreting\TypeTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Bike.Test,LanguageTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Interpreting\LanguageTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Bike.Test,LexerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Parsing\LexerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Bike.Test,PrintNodeWalker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\PrintNodeWalker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 90 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Bike.Test,PrintNodeWalker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\PrintNodeWalker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 91 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bike.Test,PrintNodeWalker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike.Test\Common\PrintNodeWalker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Exit
