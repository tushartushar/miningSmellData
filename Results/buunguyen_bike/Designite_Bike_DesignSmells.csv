Missing Hierarchy,Bike.Interpreter,Interpreter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\buunguyen_bike\src\Bike\Interpreter\Interpreter.Assignment.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: BikeFunction' IndexSuffix' Arguments (in method "AccessOneByOne" of class "Interpreter").
