Unutilized Abstraction,TapkuSample,AppDelegate,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TapkuSample,TapkuSampleViewController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\TapkuSampleViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TapkuSample,TapkuSampleViewController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\TapkuSampleViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TapkuSampleViewController (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\TapkuSampleViewController.cs' [13' 89])' HUDViewController (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\HUDViewController.cs' [27' 103])
Duplicate Abstraction,TapkuSample,TapkuSampleViewController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\TapkuSampleViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TapkuSampleViewController (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\TapkuSampleViewController.cs' [104' 150])' HUDViewController (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\HUDViewController.cs' [103' 149])
Unnecessary Abstraction,TapkuSample,RootViewController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\RootViewController.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TapkuSample,RootViewController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\RootViewController.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,TapkuSample,ImageCenterViewController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\ImageCenterViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadView
Unutilized Abstraction,TapkuSample,RootViewController1,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\Tapku\samples\TapkuSample\RootViewController1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
