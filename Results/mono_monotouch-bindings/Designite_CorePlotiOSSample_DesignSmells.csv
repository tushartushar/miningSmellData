Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,CorePlotiOSSample,Application,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Application (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\Main.cs' [3' 25])' AppDelegate (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\AppDelegate.cs' [3' 25])
Unutilized Abstraction,CorePlotiOSSample,AppDelegate,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CorePlotiOSSample,SelectionSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\ScatterPlot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CorePlotiOSSample,RandomSamplesSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\ScatterPlot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Data
Broken Hierarchy,CorePlotiOSSample,BarPlot,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\BarPlot.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CorePlotiOSSample.PlotViewController
Broken Hierarchy,CorePlotiOSSample,PiePlot,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\PiePlot.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CorePlotiOSSample.PlotViewController
Broken Hierarchy,CorePlotiOSSample,RangePlot,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\RangePlot.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CorePlotiOSSample.PlotViewController
Broken Hierarchy,CorePlotiOSSample,ScatterPlot,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monotouch-bindings\CorePlot\samples\CorePlotiOSSample\CorePlotiOSSample\ScatterPlot.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CorePlotiOSSample.PlotViewController
