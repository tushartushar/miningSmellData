Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,RootobjectE,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\Earthquake.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: earthquakes
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,RootobjectE,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\Earthquake.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,RootObjectWO,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\WeatherObservation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: weatherObservations
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,RootObjectWO,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\WeatherObservation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,EarthquakePage,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\EarthquakePage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,EarthquakePage,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\EarthquakePage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  EarthquakePage (C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\EarthquakePage.cs' [64' 84])' WeatherObservationPage (C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\WeatherObservationPage.cs' [69' 89])
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlotDemo,WeatherObservationPage,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\WeatherObservationPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,OxyPlotDemo,OxyPlotView,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\OxyPlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OnInvalidateDisplay
Broken Modularization,OxyPlotDemo,WeatherObservation,C:\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-forms-samples\OxyPlotWebService\OxyPlot\WeatherObservation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: clouds' weatherCondition' observation' windDirection' ICAO' lng' temperature' dewPoint' weatherConditionCode' windSpeed' humidity' stationName' datetime' lat' cloudsCode' hectoPascAltimeter
