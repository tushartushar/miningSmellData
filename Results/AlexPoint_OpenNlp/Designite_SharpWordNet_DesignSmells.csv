Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpWordNet,Relation,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Relation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Relation (C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Relation.cs' [1' 21])' RelationType (C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\RelationType.cs' [1' 21])' Synset (C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Synset.cs' [1' 21])' Tokenizer (C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Tokenizer.cs' [1' 21])
Imperative Abstraction,SharpWordNet.Morph,TokenizerOperation,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Morph\TokenizerOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpWordNet,Relation,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Relation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpWordNet.Relation' SharpWordNet.Synset
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpWordNet,Synset,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Synset.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpWordNet.Synset' SharpWordNet.Relation
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpWordNet,WordNetEngine,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\WordNetEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpWordNet.WordNetEngine' SharpWordNet.Morph.TokenizerOperation
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpWordNet.Morph,TokenizerOperation,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Morph\TokenizerOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpWordNet.Morph.TokenizerOperation' SharpWordNet.WordNetEngine
Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpWordNet.Morph,AbstractDelegatingOperation,C:\repos\AlexPoint_OpenNlp\SharpWordNet\Morph\AbstractDelegatingOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
