Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,BenchmarkIt,ResultExtensions,C:\repos\bodyloss_BenchmarkIt\BenchmarkIt\ResultExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BenchmarkIt,Against,C:\repos\bodyloss_BenchmarkIt\BenchmarkIt\Against.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BenchmarkIt.Against' BenchmarkIt.Benchmark
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BenchmarkIt,Against,C:\repos\bodyloss_BenchmarkIt\BenchmarkIt\Against.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BenchmarkIt.Against' BenchmarkIt.Benchmark' BenchmarkIt.Constraint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BenchmarkIt,Benchmark,C:\repos\bodyloss_BenchmarkIt\BenchmarkIt\Benchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BenchmarkIt.Benchmark' BenchmarkIt.Constraint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BenchmarkIt,Constraint,C:\repos\bodyloss_BenchmarkIt\BenchmarkIt\Constraint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BenchmarkIt.Constraint' BenchmarkIt.Benchmark
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BenchmarkIt,Constraint,C:\repos\bodyloss_BenchmarkIt\BenchmarkIt\Constraint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BenchmarkIt.Constraint' BenchmarkIt.Benchmark' BenchmarkIt.Against
