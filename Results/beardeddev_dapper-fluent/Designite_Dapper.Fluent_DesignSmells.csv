Unnecessary Abstraction,Dapper,IMemberMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ColumnName' MemberType' Property' Field' Parameter
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dapper,DontMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper.Fluent,DbManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\DbManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 229
Broken Modularization,Dapper,IMemberMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.

Broken Modularization,Dapper,ParamInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Value' ParameterDirection' DbType' Size' AttachedParam
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.SqlMapper' Dapper.DynamicParameters
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DbString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.DbString' Dapper.SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DefaultTypeMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.DefaultTypeMap' Dapper.SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.SqlMapper' Dapper.SimpleMemberMap' Dapper.DefaultTypeMap
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DynamicParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DefaultTypeMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.DefaultTypeMap' Dapper.SqlMapper' Dapper.DynamicParameters
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DynamicParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.DynamicParameters' Dapper.SqlMapper' Dapper.SimpleMemberMap' Dapper.DefaultTypeMap
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DbString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dapper.DbString' Dapper.SqlMapper' Dapper.SimpleMemberMap' Dapper.DefaultTypeMap
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dapper,CustomPropertyTypeMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\beardeddev_dapper-fluent\Dapper.Fluent\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetConstructorParameter
