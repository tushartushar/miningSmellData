Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,PassThroughContentCommandBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\PassThroughContentCommandBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PassThru' ProviderRuntime
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,CoreCommandWithPathsBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\CoreCommandWithPathsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ProviderSupportsShouldProcess' Path' LiteralPath' InternalPaths
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,CoreCommandWithFilteredPathsBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\CoreCommandWithFilteredPathsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exclude' Filter' Include
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Management.Automation.Internal,ISupportShouldProcess,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\ISupportShouldProcess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SupportsShouldProcess
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,ConvertPathCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\ConvertPathCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ProcessRecord
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,CoreCommandBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\CoreCommandBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Management.Automation.PSCmdlet' System.Management.Automation.IDynamicParameters' System.Management.Automation.Internal.ISupportShouldProcess
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,DriveMatchingCoreCommandBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\DriveMatchingCoreCommandBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.CoreCommandBase
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,ProcessBaseCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\ProcessBaseCommand.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet
Unfactored Hierarchy,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands,ResumeServiceCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\ResumeServiceCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  ResumeServiceCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\ResumeServiceCommand.cs' [27' 49])' SuspendServiceCommand (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pash-Project_Pash\Source\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\SuspendServiceCommand.cs' [27' 49])
