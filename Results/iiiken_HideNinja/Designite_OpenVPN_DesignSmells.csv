Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,OpenVPN,AsyncEventDetail,C:\repos\iiiken_HideNinja\HideNinja\OpenVPN\AsyncEventDetail.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: getInfos
Imperative Abstraction,OpenVPN.States,State,C:\repos\iiiken_HideNinja\HideNinja\OpenVPN\States\State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateSnapshot
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenVPN.States,StateSnapshot,C:\repos\iiiken_HideNinja\HideNinja\OpenVPN\States\StateSnapshot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionState' VPNState
