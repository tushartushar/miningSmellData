Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,cmd,Cmd,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Cmd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,cmd.Runner,IRunOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Runner\IRunOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Command' Arguments
Unnecessary Abstraction,cmd.Runner.Shells,Shell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Runner\Shells\Shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Default' Cmd' Powershell
Deficient Encapsulation,cmd.Runner.Shells,Shell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Runner\Shells\Shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Default' Cmd' Powershell
Deficient Encapsulation,cmd.Runner.Shells,Shell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Runner\Shells\Shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Default' Cmd' Powershell
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,cmd.Commands,Commando,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Commands\Commando.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: cmd.Commands.Commando' cmd.Runner.Shells.ProcessRunner
Broken Hierarchy,cmd.Commands,CmdCommando,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Commands\CmdCommando.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): cmd.Commands.Commando
Rebellious Hierarchy,cmd.Commands,PowershellCommando,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Commands\PowershellCommando.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddCommand
Rebellious Hierarchy,cmd.Runner.Shells,Posh,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\manojlds_cmd\src\cmd\Runner\Shells\Posh.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BuildArgument' GetCommand
