Imperative Abstraction,Github.Ulex.ZenSharp.Integration,CSharpExtendedScopeProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ulex_ZenSharp\ZenSharp.Integration\CSharpExtendedScopeProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProvideScopePoints
Unutilized Abstraction,Github.Ulex.ZenSharp.Integration,ExceptionConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ulex_ZenSharp\ZenSharp.Integration\Option\ExceptionConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
