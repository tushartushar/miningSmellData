Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,UnityDissector.IO,ConsoleIO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\IO\ConsoleIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Decoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA.Decoder' UnityDissector.Compression.RangeCoder.Decoder
Duplicate Abstraction,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA.Encoder' UnityDissector.Compression.RangeCoder.Encoder
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.LZ,InWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZ\LzInWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _bufferBase' _bufferOffset' _blockSize' _pos' _streamPos
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.IO,ConsoleIO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\IO\ConsoleIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OutLogName' OutLogPath
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.IO,ConsoleIO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\IO\ConsoleIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: OutLogName' OutLogPath
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Index
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Optimal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: State' Prev1IsChar' Prev2' PosPrev2' BackPrev2' Price' PosPrev' BackPrev' Backs0' Backs1' Backs2' Backs3
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.RangeCoder,Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\RangeCoder\RangeCoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Low' Range
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.RangeCoder,Decoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\RangeCoder\RangeCoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Range' Code' Stream
Insufficient Modularization,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 179
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UnityDissector.CommandLine,CommandLineHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\CommandLine\CommandLineHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UnityDissector.CommandLine.CommandLineHandler' UnityDissector.CommandLine.Option
Broken Hierarchy,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,LenPriceTableEncoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA.LenEncoder
