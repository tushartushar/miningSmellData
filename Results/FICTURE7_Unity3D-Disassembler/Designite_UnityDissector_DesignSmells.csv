Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.RangeCoder,Encoder,C:\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\RangeCoder\RangeCoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Low' Range
Deficient Encapsulation,UnityDissector.Compression.RangeCoder,Decoder,C:\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\RangeCoder\RangeCoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Range' Code' Stream
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UnityDissector.CommandLine,CommandLineHandler,C:\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\CommandLine\CommandLineHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UnityDissector.CommandLine.CommandLineHandler' UnityDissector.CommandLine.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UnityDissector.CommandLine,Option,C:\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\CommandLine\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UnityDissector.CommandLine.Option' UnityDissector.CommandLine.CommandLineHandler
Insufficient Modularization,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Encoder,C:\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,UnityDissector.Compression.LZMA,Encoder,C:\repos\FICTURE7_Unity3D-Disassembler\Source\Compression\LZMA\LzmaEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex.
