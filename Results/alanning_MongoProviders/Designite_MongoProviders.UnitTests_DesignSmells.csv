Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,MongoProviders.UnitTests,MembershipProviderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateUserWithFormat which is more interested in members of the type: MembershipProvider
Feature Envy,MongoProviders.UnitTests,MembershipProviderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ResetPasswordWorksWhenRequiresQuestionAndAnswerIsFalse which is more interested in members of the type: MembershipProvider
Feature Envy,MongoProviders.UnitTests,MembershipProviderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CanResetPasswordForHashedAndSaltedPasswords which is more interested in members of the type: MembershipProvider
Unnecessary Abstraction,MongoProviders.UnitTests,Profile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstName
Insufficient Modularization,MongoProviders.UnitTests,MembershipProviderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MongoProviders.UnitTests,MembershipProviderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,MongoProviders.UnitTests,MembershipProviderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  MembershipProviderTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs' [1' 30])' RoleProviderTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\RoleProviderTest.cs' [1' 30])
Broken Hierarchy,MongoProviders.UnitTests,Profile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alanning_MongoProviders\MongoProviders.UnitTests\MembershipProviderTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MongoProviders.User
