Duplicate Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Core,Authentification,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Core\Authentification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Authentification[1' 21]' Kernel[1' 21]' Token[1' 21]' ApiModuleTypeAttribute[1' 21]
Unutilized Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Core,AuthorizedKernel,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Core\AuthorizedKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Core,AuthorizedKernel,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Core\AuthorizedKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AuthorizedKernel[2' 21]' Kernel[3' 22]
Unutilized Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Core,HttpWebRequestExtension,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Core\Extensions\HttpWebRequestExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Domain,UserCreationInfo,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Domain\UserCreationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LoginName' DisplayName' EmailAddress' Password
Unutilized Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Domain.Attributes,ApiModuleTypeHelper,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Domain\Attributes\ApiModuleTypeAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Kernels,FileSystemKernel,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Kernels\FileSystemKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.96
Unutilized Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Kernels,FileSystemKernel,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Kernels\FileSystemKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Models,Role,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Models\Role.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Description' Permissions' IsDefault
Unutilized Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Models,Role,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Models\Role.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RedundancyLibrary.Models,UploadFile,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Models\UploadFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,RedundancyLibrary.Kernels,FileSystemKernel,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Kernels\FileSystemKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Broken Modularization,RedundancyLibrary.Models,FileSystemChangeInfo,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Models\FileSystemChangeInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' DisplayName' Day' DayTime' Type' Hash
Broken Modularization,RedundancyLibrary.Models,FileSystemItem,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Models\FileSystemItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' DisplayName' OwnerID' ParentID' CreateDateTime' LastChangeDateTime' Hash' MimeType' FilePath' Thumbnail' SizeInBytes' SizeWithUnit' UsedUserAgent
Broken Modularization,RedundancyLibrary.Models,User,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Models\User.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' LoginName' DisplayName' MailAddress' RegistrationDateTime' LastLoginDateTime' PasswordHash' IsEnabled' ContingentInByte' Role' FailedLogins
Unfactored Hierarchy,RedundancyLibrary.Kernels,FileSystemKernel,C:\repos\Redundancycloud_redundancy-library\libRedundancy\libRedundancy\Kernels\FileSystemKernel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: FileSystemKernel[2' 23]' UserKernel[3' 24]
