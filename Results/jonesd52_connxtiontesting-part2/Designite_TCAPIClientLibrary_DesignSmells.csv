Insufficient Modularization,RusticiSoftware.TinCanAPILibrary,TCAPI,C:\repos\jonesd52_connxtiontesting-part2\Test-Networking\TinCanAPILibraryCSharp\TCAPIClientLibrary\TCAPI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 48 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RusticiSoftware.TinCanAPILibrary,TCAPI,C:\repos\jonesd52_connxtiontesting-part2\Test-Networking\TinCanAPILibraryCSharp\TCAPIClientLibrary\TCAPI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 56 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RusticiSoftware.TinCanAPILibrary,TCAPI,C:\repos\jonesd52_connxtiontesting-part2\Test-Networking\TinCanAPILibraryCSharp\TCAPIClientLibrary\TCAPI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 175
Rebellious Hierarchy,RusticiSoftware.TinCanAPILibrary.Model,TCAPICallback,C:\repos\jonesd52_connxtiontesting-part2\Test-Networking\TinCanAPILibraryCSharp\TCAPIClientLibrary\Model\TCAPICallback.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StatementsStored
Rebellious Hierarchy,RusticiSoftware.TinCanAPILibrary,TCAPI,C:\repos\jonesd52_connxtiontesting-part2\Test-Networking\TinCanAPILibraryCSharp\TCAPIClientLibrary\TCAPI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetOAuthAuthorizationUrl' UpdateOAuthTokenCredentials
