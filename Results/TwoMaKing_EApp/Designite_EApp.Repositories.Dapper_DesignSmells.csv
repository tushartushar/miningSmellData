Unnecessary Abstraction,Dappers,AssemblyNeutralAttribute,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Dappers,AssemblyNeutralAttribute,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Dappers,AssemblyNeutralAttribute,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AssemblyNeutralAttribute[1827' 1860]' AssemblyNeutralAttribute[1898' 1931]

Unnecessary Abstraction,Dappers,IWrappedDataReader,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Reader' Command
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dappers,ExplicitConstructorAttribute,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,CommandDefinition,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CommandDefinition' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,CommandDefinition,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CommandDefinition' SqlMapper' DynamicParameters' SqlMapper
Insufficient Modularization,Dappers,SqlMapper,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dappers,SqlMapper,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 93 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dappers,SqlMapper,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 440
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,SqlMapper,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SqlMapper' DynamicParameters
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,TableValuedParameter,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TableValuedParameter' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,TableValuedParameter,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TableValuedParameter' SqlMapper' DynamicParameters' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,DefaultTypeMap,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DefaultTypeMap' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dappers,DefaultTypeMap,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DefaultTypeMap' SqlMapper' DynamicParameters' SqlMapper
Rebellious Hierarchy,EApp.Respositories.Dapper,DapperRepository,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Respositories.Dapper\DapperRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoDelete' DoFind' DoFindAll' DoFindAll' DoPersistAddedItems' DoPersistModifiedItems' DoPersistDeletedItems
