Duplicate Abstraction,EApp.Plugin.Generic,FormPluginOverlayBase,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\FormPluginOverlayBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FormPluginOverlayBase[48' 76]' CoreNavigationForm[169' 197]
Imperative Abstraction,EApp.Plugin.Generic.RibbonStyle,CoreNavigationForm,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\RibbonStyle\CoreNavigationForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RegisterRibbonButtonClickCommand
Duplicate Abstraction,EApp.Plugin.Generic.RibbonStyle,RibbonExtensionHelper,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\RibbonStyle\RibbonExtensionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: RibbonExtensionHelper[120' 139]' RibbonExtensionHelper[152' 171]
Imperative Abstraction,EApp.Plugin.Generic.RibbonStyle,RibbonModulePluginHost,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\RibbonStyle\RibbonModulePluginHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Exit
Rebellious Hierarchy,EApp.Plugin.Generic,PluginHost,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\PluginHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Exit
Unfactored Hierarchy,EApp.Plugin.Generic,UCPluginViewBase,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\UCPluginViewBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: UCPluginViewBase[201' 235]' UCRibbonPluginViewBase[65' 99]
Missing Hierarchy,EApp.Plugin.Generic.RibbonStyle,RibbonModulePluginHost,D:\newReposJune17\TwoMaKing_EApp\EApp.Plugin.Generic\RibbonStyle\RibbonModulePluginHost.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IView' IPluginUnloadingContextAction (in method "OnTickedControllerToBeExecutedLoading" of class "RibbonModulePluginHost").
