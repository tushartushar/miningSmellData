Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Pluton.Patcher,Pluton.Patcher,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Pluton.Patcher' Pluton.Patcher.Reflection,Pluton.Patcher.MainClass' Pluton.Patcher.Reflection.MethodPatcher
Unstable Dependency,Pluton.Patcher,Pluton.Patcher.Reflection,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Pluton.Patcher,Pluton.Patcher.Reflection.MainClass
Feature Concentration,Pluton.Patcher,Pluton.Patcher,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MainClass' ExitCode]' [Empty<T>]' [TypeDefinitionExtensions]' [MethodDefinitionExtensions]' [FieldDefinitionExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.83,Pluton.Patcher.Empty<T>' Pluton.Patcher.TypeDefinitionExtensions' Pluton.Patcher.MethodDefinitionExtensions' Pluton.Patcher.FieldDefinitionExtensions
