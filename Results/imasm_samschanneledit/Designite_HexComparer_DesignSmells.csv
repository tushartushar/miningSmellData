Duplicate Abstraction,HexComparer,FMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\FMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FMain (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\FMain.cs' [1' 20])' HexViewerItemChangedEventArgs (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\HexViewerControl.cs' [1' 20])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\Program.cs' [1' 20])' RegSizePrompt (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\RegSizePrompt.cs' [1' 20])' UCHexViewer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\UCHexViewer.cs' [1' 20])' UCViewData (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\UCViewData.cs' [1' 20])
Imperative Abstraction,HexComparer,HexViewerControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\HexViewerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetData
Duplicate Abstraction,HexComparer,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\Program.cs' [1' 24])' UCHexViewer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\UCHexViewer.cs' [1' 24])
Unutilized Abstraction,HexComparer,UCHexViewer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\UCHexViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,HexComparer,UCViewData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\UCViewData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowValues
Unutilized Abstraction,HexComparer,UCViewData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\UCViewData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,HexComparer.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\Source\HexComparer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
