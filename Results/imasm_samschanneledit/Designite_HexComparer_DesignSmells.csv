Duplicate Abstraction,HexComparer,FMain,C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\FMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FMain (C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\FMain.cs' [1' 20])' HexViewerItemChangedEventArgs (C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\HexViewerControl.cs' [1' 20])' Program (C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\Program.cs' [1' 20])' RegSizePrompt (C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\RegSizePrompt.cs' [1' 20])' UCHexViewer (C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\UCHexViewer.cs' [1' 20])' UCViewData (C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\UCViewData.cs' [1' 20])
Imperative Abstraction,HexComparer,HexViewerControl,C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\HexViewerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetData
Duplicate Abstraction,HexComparer,Program,C:\repos\imasm_samschanneledit\HexComparer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
