Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,INotifyInvalidData,F:\newReposMay17\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\INotifyInvalidData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,InvalidDataEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\InvalidDataEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Base64Encoder,F:\newReposMay17\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: IdSharp.Common.Utils.Base64Encoder' Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.Encoders.Base64Encoder
Duplicate Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Http,F:\newReposMay17\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Http[215' 238]' Http[258' 281]
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,StreamUtils,F:\newReposMay17\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\StreamUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.Encoders,Base64Encoder,F:\newReposMay17\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Base64Encoder[144' 167]' Base64Encoder[221' 244]
