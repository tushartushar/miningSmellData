Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,CancelDataEventArgs<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\CancelDataEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,INotifyInvalidData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\INotifyInvalidData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Base64Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Base64Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: IdSharp.Common.Utils.Base64Encoder' Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.Encoders.Base64Encoder
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,CRC32,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\CRC32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,EnumUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\EnumUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Http,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Http,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Http (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs' [215' 238])' Http (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs' [258' 281])
Unnecessary Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,RequestAndData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Request' Data
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,StreamUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\StreamUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.Encoders,Base64Encoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Base64Encoder (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs' [144' 167])' Base64Encoder (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs' [221' 244])
Deficient Encapsulation,IdSharp.Common.Utils,RequestAndData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Request' Data
