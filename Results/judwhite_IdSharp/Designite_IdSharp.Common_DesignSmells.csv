Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,CancelDataEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\CancelDataEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,DataEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\DataEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Events,INotifyInvalidData,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Events\INotifyInvalidData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Base64Encoder,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: IdSharp.Common.Utils.Base64Encoder' Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.Encoders.Base64Encoder
Duplicate Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,Http,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Http (C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs' [215' 238])' Http (C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs' [258' 281])
Unnecessary Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,RequestAndData,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Request' Data
Unutilized Abstraction,IdSharp.Common.Utils,StreamUtils,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\StreamUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.Encoders,Base64Encoder,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Base64Encoder (C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs' [144' 167])' Base64Encoder (C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\BouncyCastle\Base64Encoder.cs' [221' 244])
Deficient Encapsulation,IdSharp.Common.Utils,RequestAndData,C:\repos\judwhite_IdSharp\IdSharp.Common\Utils\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Request' Data
