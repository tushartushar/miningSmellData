Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,IdSharp.Example.Wpf,IdSharp.Tagging.Harness.Wpf.Controls,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): IdSharp.Tagging.Harness.Wpf.View
Unstable Dependency,IdSharp.Example.Wpf,IdSharp.Tagging.Harness.Wpf.Model,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): IdSharp.Tagging.ID3v2
Feature Concentration,IdSharp.Example.Wpf,IdSharp.Tagging.Harness.Wpf.Converters,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BitrateConverter]' [BoolToVisibilityConverter]' [EnumDescriptionConverter]' [ID3v1CommentLengthConverter]' [IsEnumEqualConverter]' [NotBoolToVisibilityConverter]' [NotNullToBoolConverter]' [NullableIntConverter]' [PlayLengthConverter]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
