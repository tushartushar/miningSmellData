Duplicate Abstraction,KinectDataTransmitter,InteractionDataTracker,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\InteractionDataTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: InteractionDataTracker[83' 103]' SkeletonDataTracker[30' 50]
Multifaceted Abstraction,KinectDataTransmitter,KinectDevice,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\KinectDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Duplicate Abstraction,KinectDataTransmitter,FaceDataTracker,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\FaceTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FaceDataTracker[24' 43]' SkeletonDataTracker[26' 45]
Deficient Encapsulation,KinectDataTransmitter,KinectDevice,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\KinectDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
