Duplicate Abstraction,KinectDataTransmitter,InteractionDataTracker,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\InteractionDataTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  InteractionDataTracker (C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\InteractionDataTracker.cs' [83' 103])' SkeletonDataTracker (C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\SkeletonTracker.cs' [30' 50])
Unnecessary Abstraction,KinectDataTransmitter,UIElementInfo,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\InteractionDataTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Left' Right' Top' Bottom' Id
Duplicate Abstraction,KinectDataTransmitter,FaceDataTracker,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\FaceTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FaceDataTracker (C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\FaceTracker.cs' [24' 43])' SkeletonDataTracker (C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\SkeletonTracker.cs' [26' 45])
Deficient Encapsulation,KinectDataTransmitter,KinectDevice,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\KinectDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Sensor
Broken Modularization,KinectDataTransmitter,UIElementInfo,C:\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\KinectDataTransmitter\InteractionDataTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Left' Right' Top' Bottom' Id
