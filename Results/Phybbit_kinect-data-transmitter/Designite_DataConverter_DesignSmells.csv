Unutilized Abstraction,DataConverter,Converter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataConverter,BodyTrackingState,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataConverter,BodyData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UserId' PlayerIndex' IsTracked' JointData
Deficient Encapsulation,DataConverter,Converter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: JointCount
Deficient Encapsulation,DataConverter,Converter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: JointCount
Deficient Encapsulation,DataConverter,HandPointer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UserId' HandEventType' HandType' X' Y' PressExtent' IsActive' IsInteractive' IsPressed' IsTracked
Deficient Encapsulation,DataConverter,BodyData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UserId' PlayerIndex' IsTracked' JointData
Deficient Encapsulation,DataConverter,JointData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: JointId' State' PositionX' PositionY' PositionZ' QuaternionX' QuaternionY' QuaternionZ' QuaternionW
Deficient Encapsulation,DataConverter,FaceData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UserId' Au0' Au1' Au2' Au3' Au4' Au5' PosX' PosY' PosZ' RotX' RotY' RotZ
Insufficient Modularization,DataConverter,Converter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DataConverter,Converter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Broken Modularization,DataConverter,HandPointer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UserId' HandEventType' HandType' X' Y' PressExtent' IsActive' IsInteractive' IsPressed' IsTracked
Broken Modularization,DataConverter,JointData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' JointId' State' PositionX' PositionY' PositionZ' QuaternionX' QuaternionY' QuaternionZ' QuaternionW
Broken Modularization,DataConverter,FaceData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Phybbit_kinect-data-transmitter\DataConverter\Converter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UserId' Au0' Au1' Au2' Au3' Au4' Au5' PosX' PosY' PosZ' RotX' RotY' RotZ
