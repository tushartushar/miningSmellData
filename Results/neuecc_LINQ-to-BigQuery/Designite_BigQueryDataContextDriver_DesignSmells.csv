Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Linq,AnonymousComparer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\AnonymousComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BigQuery.Linq,BigQueryDataContextDriver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\BigQueryDataContextDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BigQuery.Linq,Extensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BigQuery.Linq,Schema,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\SchemaBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DatasetName' GroupedMetaTableSchemas
Feature Envy,BigQuery.Linq,ConnectionDialog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\ConnectionDialog.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConnectionDialog which is more interested in members of the type: DriverProperty
Feature Envy,BigQuery.Linq,ConnectionDialog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\ConnectionDialog.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OK_Click which is more interested in members of the type: DriverProperty
Insufficient Modularization,System.Linq,AnonymousComparer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-BigQuery\BigQueryDataContextDriver\AnonymousComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
