Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Sampler,Sample,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ValueAt
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioMerger,UtilityFunctions,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\AudioMixer\UtilityFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,AudioMerger,UtilityFunctions,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\AudioMixer\UtilityFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: UtilityFunctions[20' 41]' WAVFile[1851' 1872]
Multifaceted Abstraction,EricOulashin,WAVFile,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\AudioMixer\WAVFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unnecessary Abstraction,Sampler.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,Sampler,SamplerForm,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\SamplerForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,EricOulashin,WAVFile,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\AudioMixer\WAVFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,EricOulashin,WAVFile,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\AudioMixer\WAVFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,EricOulashin,WAVFile,C:\repos\barometz_Sampler\Sampler\AudioMixer\WAVFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 248
