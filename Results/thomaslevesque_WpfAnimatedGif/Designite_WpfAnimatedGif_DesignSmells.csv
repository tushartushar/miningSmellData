Unnecessary Abstraction,WpfAnimatedGif.Properties,VersionInfo,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' VersionString
Unutilized Abstraction,WpfAnimatedGif.Properties,VersionInfo,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifFile,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifFile.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: GifFrame' GifExtension (in method "ReadFrames" of class "GifFile").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif,ImageAnimationController,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\ImageAnimationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WpfAnimatedGif.ImageAnimationController' WpfAnimatedGif.ImageBehavior
Insufficient Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif,ImageBehavior,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\ImageBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif,ImageBehavior,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\ImageBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif,ImageBehavior,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\ImageBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WpfAnimatedGif.ImageBehavior' WpfAnimatedGif.ImageAnimationController
Broken Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif,FrameMetadata,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\ImageBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Left' Top' Width' Height' Delay' DisposalMethod
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifApplicationExtension,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifApplicationExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding.GifApplicationExtension' WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding.GifHelpers
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifHelpers,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding.GifHelpers' WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding.GifApplicationExtension
Cyclic Hierarchy,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifBlock,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GifExtension
Cyclic Hierarchy,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifBlock,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GifFrame
Cyclic Hierarchy,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifBlock,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GifTrailer
Cyclic Hierarchy,WpfAnimatedGif.Decoding,GifExtension,C:\repos\thomaslevesque_WpfAnimatedGif\WpfAnimatedGif\Decoding\GifExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy).
