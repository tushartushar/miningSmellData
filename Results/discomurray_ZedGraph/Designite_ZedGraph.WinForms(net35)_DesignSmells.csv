Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ZedGraph,ZedGraphControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.WinForms\ZedGraphControl.ContextMenu.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ImageRender which is more interested in members of the type: MasterPane
Unexploited Encapsulation,ZedGraph,ZedGraphControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.WinForms\ZedGraphControl.ContextMenu.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PieItem' BarItem' HiLowBarItem (in method "HandlePointValues" of class "ZedGraphControl").
Insufficient Modularization,ZedGraph,ZedGraphControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.WinForms\ZedGraphControl.ContextMenu.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 79 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ZedGraph,ZedGraphControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.WinForms\ZedGraphControl.ContextMenu.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 322
Missing Hierarchy,ZedGraph,ZedGraphControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.WinForms\ZedGraphControl.ContextMenu.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CurveItem' PieItem (in method "HandlePointValues" of class "ZedGraphControl").
