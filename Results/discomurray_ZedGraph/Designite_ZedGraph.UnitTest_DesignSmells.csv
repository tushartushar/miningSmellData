Deficient Encapsulation,ZedGraph.UnitTest,TestUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.UnitTest\ZGTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: waitForUserOK' delayTime' clickDone
Deficient Encapsulation,ZedGraph.UnitTest,TestUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.UnitTest\ZGTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: waitForUserOK' delayTime' clickDone
Insufficient Modularization,ZedGraph.UnitTest,LibraryTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.UnitTest\ZGTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,ZedGraph,TestZedGraphControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.UnitTest\ZedGraphControlTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ZedGraph.ZedGraphControl
Missing Hierarchy,ZedGraph.UnitTest,FindNearestTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.UnitTest\ZGTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: GraphObj' CurveItem' Legend (in method "HandleFind" of class "FindNearestTest").
Missing Hierarchy,ZedGraph.UnitTest,FindNearestTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discomurray_ZedGraph\source\ZedGraph.UnitTest\ZGTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Axis' GraphPane (in method "HandleFind" of class "FindNearestTest").
