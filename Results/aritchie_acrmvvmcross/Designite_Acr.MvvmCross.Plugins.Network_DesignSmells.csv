Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network,PluginLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aritchie_acrmvvmcross\Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network\PluginLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network,INetworkService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aritchie_acrmvvmcross\Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network\INetworkService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network.INetworkService' Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network.NetworkStatusChangedMessage
Rebellious Hierarchy,Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network,AbstractNetworkService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aritchie_acrmvvmcross\Acr.MvvmCross.Plugins.Network\AbstractNetworkService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: IsHostReachable
