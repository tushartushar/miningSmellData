Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,PusherClient,Connection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: websocket_MessageReceived which is more interested in members of the type: IPusher
Unnecessary Abstraction,PusherClient,ErrorConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\ErrorConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ApplicationKeyNotSet' ConnectionAlreadyConnected
Unnecessary Abstraction,PusherClient,SubscriptionData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\GenericPresenceChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: presence
Unnecessary Abstraction,PusherClient,Presence,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\GenericPresenceChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ids' hash' count
Unnecessary Abstraction,PusherClient,MemberData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\GenericPresenceChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: user_id' user_info
Unnecessary Abstraction,PusherClient,PusherOptions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\PusherOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Encrypted' Authorizer' Cluster' Host
Deficient Encapsulation,PusherClient,Pusher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\Pusher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Trace
Deficient Encapsulation,PusherClient,Pusher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\Pusher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Trace
Broken Modularization,PusherClient,Constants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PUSHER_MESSAGE_PREFIX' ERROR' CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED' CHANNEL_SUBSCRIBE' CHANNEL_UNSUBSCRIBE' CHANNEL_SUBSCRIPTION_SUCCEEDED' CHANNEL_SUBSCRIPTION_ERROR' CHANNEL_MEMBER_ADDED' CHANNEL_MEMBER_REMOVED' INSECURE_SCHEMA' SECURE_SCHEMA' PRIVATE_CHANNEL' PRESENCE_CHANNEL
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PusherClient,Connection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PusherClient.Connection' PusherClient.Pusher
Broken Hierarchy,PusherClient,Channel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\Channel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PusherClient.EventEmitter
Broken Hierarchy,PusherClient,PrivateChannel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pusher_pusher-websocket-dotnet\PusherClient\PrivateChannel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PusherClient.Channel
