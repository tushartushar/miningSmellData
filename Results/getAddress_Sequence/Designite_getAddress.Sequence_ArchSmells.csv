Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Ambiguous Interface,getAddress.Sequence,getAddress.Sequence,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: SequenceGenerator,getAddress.Sequence.SequenceGenerator
Feature Concentration,getAddress.Sequence,getAddress.Sequence,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MaximumValueReachedException]' [SequenceCouldNotBeFoundException]' [MinimumValueReachedException]' [MaxRetryAttemptReachedException]' [ISequence' IStateProvider' SequenceGenerator' TryGetSequenceValueResult' SequenceKey' SequenceOptions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,getAddress.Sequence.MaximumValueReachedException' getAddress.Sequence.SequenceCouldNotBeFoundException' getAddress.Sequence.MinimumValueReachedException' getAddress.Sequence.MaxRetryAttemptReachedException
