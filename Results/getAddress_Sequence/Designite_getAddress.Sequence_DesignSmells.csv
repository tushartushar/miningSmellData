Unutilized Abstraction,getAddress.Sequence,MaximumValueReachedException,F:\newReposMay17\getAddress_Sequence\getAddress.Sequence\Exceptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,getAddress.Sequence,SequenceCouldNotBeFoundException,F:\newReposMay17\getAddress_Sequence\getAddress.Sequence\Exceptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
