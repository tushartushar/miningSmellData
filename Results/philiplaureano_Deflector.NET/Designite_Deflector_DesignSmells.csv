Unutilized Abstraction,Deflector,MethodCallInterceptionExtensions,C:\repos\philiplaureano_Deflector.NET\Deflector\Deflector\MethodCallInterceptionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Deflector,MethodCallsAlreadyInterceptedAttribute,C:\repos\philiplaureano_Deflector.NET\Deflector\Deflector\MethodCallsAlreadyInterceptedAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Deflector,IInvocationInfo,C:\repos\philiplaureano_Deflector.NET\Deflector\Deflector\IInvocationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ManagedThreadId' Target' CallingInstance' TargetMethod' CallingMethod' StackTrace' ParameterTypes' TypeArguments' Arguments
Insufficient Modularization,Deflector,Replace,C:\repos\philiplaureano_Deflector.NET\Deflector\Deflector\Replace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Deflector,Replace,C:\repos\philiplaureano_Deflector.NET\Deflector\Deflector\Replace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
