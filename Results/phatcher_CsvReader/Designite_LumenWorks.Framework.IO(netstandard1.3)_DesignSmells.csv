Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv,RecordEnumerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\LumenWorks.Framework.IO\Csv\CsvReader.RecordEnumerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MoveNext which is more interested in members of the type: CsvReader
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\SolutionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AssemblyProduct' AssemblyCopyright' AssemblyVersion' AssemblyFileVersion' AssemblyInformationalVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\SolutionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv,CsvReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\LumenWorks.Framework.IO\Csv\CsvReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv,CsvReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\LumenWorks.Framework.IO\Csv\CsvReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv,CsvReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\LumenWorks.Framework.IO\Csv\CsvReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 217
Broken Modularization,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\SolutionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AssemblyProduct' AssemblyCopyright' AssemblyVersion' AssemblyFileVersion' AssemblyInformationalVersion
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv,CsvReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\LumenWorks.Framework.IO\Csv\CsvReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv.CsvReader' LumenWorks.Framework.IO.Csv.RecordEnumerator
Rebellious Hierarchy,LumenWorks.Framework.IO,NullRemovalStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\LumenWorks.Framework.IO\Csv\Stream\NullRemovalStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
