Duplicate Abstraction,CsvReaderBenchmarks,OleDbBenchmark,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\CsvReaderBenchmarks\OleDbBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OleDbBenchmark (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\CsvReaderBenchmarks\OleDbBenchmark.cs' [17' 40])' TextFieldParserBenchmark (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\CsvReaderBenchmarks\TextFieldParserBenchmark.cs' [9' 32])
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\SolutionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AssemblyProduct' AssemblyCopyright' AssemblyVersion' AssemblyFileVersion' AssemblyInformationalVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\SolutionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatcher_CsvReader\code\SolutionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
