Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.Jupyter,AlgorithmAnalysis,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\AlgorithmAnalysis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,QuantConnect.Jupyter,FutureHistory,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\FutureHistory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FutureHistory (C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\FutureHistory.cs' [1' 24])' OptionHistory (C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\OptionHistory.cs' [1' 24])
Duplicate Abstraction,QuantConnect.Jupyter,QuantBook,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  QuantBook (C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs' [540' 565])' QuantBook (C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs' [586' 611])
Broken Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Jupyter,QuantBook,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm
