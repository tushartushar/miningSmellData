Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,QuantConnect.Jupyter,FutureHistory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\FutureHistory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FutureHistory (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\FutureHistory.cs' [1' 24])' OptionHistory (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\OptionHistory.cs' [1' 24])
Duplicate Abstraction,QuantConnect.Jupyter,QuantBook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  QuantBook (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs' [534' 559])' QuantBook (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs' [580' 605])
Broken Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Jupyter,QuantBook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Jupyter\QuantBook.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm
