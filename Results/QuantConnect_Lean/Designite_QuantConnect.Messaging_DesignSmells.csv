Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.Messaging,EventMessagingHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Messaging\EventMessagingHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.Messaging,Messaging,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Messaging\Messaging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,QuantConnect.Messaging,Response,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Messaging\StreamingApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Type' Message
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.Messaging,StreamingMessageHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Messaging\StreamingMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QuantConnect.Messaging,Response,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Messaging\StreamingApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type' Message
Rebellious Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Messaging,Messaging,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Messaging\Messaging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
