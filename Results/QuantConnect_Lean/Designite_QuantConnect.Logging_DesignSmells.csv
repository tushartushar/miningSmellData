Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.Logging,LogHandlerExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\ILogHandlerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.Logging,Log,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\Log.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QuantConnect.Logging,LogEntry,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\LogEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Time' Message' MessageType
Unfactored Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Logging,CompositeLogHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\CompositeLogHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CompositeLogHandler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\CompositeLogHandler.cs' [1' 22])' CompositeNLogHandler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\CompositeNLogHandler.cs' [1' 22])
Unfactored Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Logging,CompositeLogHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\CompositeLogHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CompositeLogHandler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\CompositeLogHandler.cs' [40' 97])' CompositeNLogHandler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\CompositeNLogHandler.cs' [40' 97])
Unfactored Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Logging,ConsoleLogHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\ConsoleLogHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  ConsoleLogHandler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\ConsoleLogHandler.cs' [1' 22])' FileLogHandler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\FileLogHandler.cs' [1' 22])
Broken Hierarchy,QuantConnect.Logging,RegressionFileLogHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Logging\RegressionFileLogHandler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): QuantConnect.Logging.FileLogHandler
