Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.AlgorithmFactory,DebuggerHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\AlgorithmFactory\DebuggerHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect.AlgorithmFactory,Loader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\AlgorithmFactory\Loader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,QuantConnect.AlgorithmFactory,Loader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\AlgorithmFactory\Loader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: appDomain
Insufficient Modularization,QuantConnect.AlgorithmFactory.Python.Wrappers,AlgorithmPythonWrapper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\AlgorithmFactory\Python\Wrappers\AlgorithmPythonWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 57 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuantConnect.AlgorithmFactory.Python.Wrappers,AlgorithmPythonWrapper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\AlgorithmFactory\Python\Wrappers\AlgorithmPythonWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 58 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,QuantConnect.AlgorithmFactory.Python.Wrappers,AlgorithmPythonWrapper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\AlgorithmFactory\Python\Wrappers\AlgorithmPythonWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
