Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect,Compression,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Compression\Compression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QuantConnect,ZipStreamWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Compression\ZipStreamWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,QuantConnect,Compression,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Compression\Compression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuantConnect,Compression,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Compression\Compression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
