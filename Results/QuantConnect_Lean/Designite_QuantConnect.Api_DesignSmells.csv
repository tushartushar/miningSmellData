Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,QuantConnect.Api,ApiConnection,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\ApiConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Client
Insufficient Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,Api,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\Api.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,Api,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\Api.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,Api,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\Api.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuantConnect.Api.Api' QuantConnect.Api.ApiWebSocketConnection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,ApiConnection,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\ApiConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuantConnect.Api.ApiConnection' QuantConnect.Api.Api
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,ApiConnection,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\ApiConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuantConnect.Api.ApiConnection' QuantConnect.Api.Api' QuantConnect.Api.ApiWebSocketConnection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,ApiWebSocketConnection,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\ApiWebSocketConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuantConnect.Api.ApiWebSocketConnection' QuantConnect.Api.Api
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuantConnect.Api,ApiWebSocketConnection,C:\repos\QuantConnect_Lean\Api\ApiWebSocketConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuantConnect.Api.ApiWebSocketConnection' QuantConnect.Api.Api' QuantConnect.Api.ApiConnection
