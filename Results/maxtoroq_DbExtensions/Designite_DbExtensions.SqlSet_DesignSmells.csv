Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,DbExtensions,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Database (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\Database.cs' [569' 596])' SqlSet (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlSet.cs' [858' 885])
Insufficient Modularization,DbExtensions,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DbExtensions,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DbExtensions,SqlBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 50 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DbExtensions,SqlBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DbExtensions,SqlSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DbExtensions,SqlSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Cyclic Hierarchy,DbExtensions,SqlSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SqlSet<TResult>
Multipath Hierarchy,DbExtensions,SqlSet<TResult>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxtoroq_DbExtensions\src\DbExtensions\SqlSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ISqlSet
