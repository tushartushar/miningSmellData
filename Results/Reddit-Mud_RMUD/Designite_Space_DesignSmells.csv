Unutilized Abstraction,Space,CustomMessages,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\CustomMessages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Space,ControlPanel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\ControlPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Indicator' Broken
Deficient Encapsulation,Space,DanConversation0,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\DanConversation0.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TopicsDiscussed' ConversationPhase
Deficient Encapsulation,Space,Room,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Room.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TimesViewed' BriefDescription' AirLevel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Space,ControlPanel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\ControlPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Space.ControlPanel' Space.Hatch
Broken Hierarchy,Space,ControlPanel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\ControlPanel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.MudObject
Broken Hierarchy,Space,Hatch,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Hatch.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Container
Broken Hierarchy,Space,Extinquisher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Extinquisher.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.MudObject
Broken Hierarchy,Space,DuctTape,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\DuctTape.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.MudObject
Broken Hierarchy,Space,Suit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Suit.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Container
Broken Hierarchy,Space,Wrench,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Wrench.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.MudObject
Broken Hierarchy,Space,Locker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Locker.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Container
Rebellious Hierarchy,Space,Room,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Room.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
Broken Hierarchy,Space,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\Space\Settings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Settings
