Unutilized Abstraction,Akkoteaque,Cipher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Cipher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akkoteaque,Player,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Akkoteaque,Player,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Akkoteaque.Player' Minimum.Player' Wells.Player' CloakOfDarkness.Player
Duplicate Abstraction,Akkoteaque,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Akkoteaque.settings' Minimum.settings' Wells.settings' CloakOfDarkness.settings
Duplicate Abstraction,Akkoteaque.Fishing,Hook,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Fishing\Hook.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Akkoteaque.Fishing.Hook' CloakOfDarkness.Hook
Unutilized Abstraction,Minimum,GameInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Minimum\GameInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Minimum,Start,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Minimum\Start.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Minimum.Start' Wells.Start
Unutilized Abstraction,Minimum,Player,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Minimum\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Wells,Player,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Wells\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CloakOfDarkness,Player,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\CloakOfDarkness\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Akkoteaque.Fishing,Rod,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Fishing\Rod.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Hook' Bait (in method "Initialize" of class "Rod").
Deficient Encapsulation,Wells,Thrad,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Wells\Thrad.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Introduced
Unfactored Hierarchy,Akkoteaque,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  settings (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Settings.cs' [17' 38])' settings (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\CloakOfDarkness\settings.cs' [17' 38])
Broken Hierarchy,Akkoteaque,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Akkoteaque\Settings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Settings
Broken Hierarchy,Minimum,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Minimum\Settings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Settings
Broken Hierarchy,Wells,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\Wells\Settings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Settings
Broken Hierarchy,CloakOfDarkness,settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\SinglePlayer\CloakOfDarkness\settings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.Settings
