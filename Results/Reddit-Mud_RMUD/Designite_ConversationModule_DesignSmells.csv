Unnecessary Abstraction,ConversationModule,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ListDiscussedTopics' AllowRepeats
Unutilized Abstraction,ConversationModule,ResponseExtensionMethods,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\NPCExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ConversationModule,ConversationRules,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\Rules.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: AtStartup
Unutilized Abstraction,ConversationModule,ConversationRules,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\Rules.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,ConversationModule,ConversationCommandFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: NPC' Player' NPC (in method "Create" of class "ConversationCommandFactory").

Deficient Encapsulation,ConversationModule,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ListDiscussedTopics' AllowRepeats
Deficient Encapsulation,ConversationModule,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ListDiscussedTopics' AllowRepeats
Deficient Encapsulation,ConversationModule,TopicSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\TopicObjectSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LocutorArgument
Broken Hierarchy,ConversationModule,Topic,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reddit-Mud_RMUD\ConversationModule\NPCExtension.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RMUD.MudObject
