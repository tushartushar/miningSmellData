Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,EpNeuralEngine.cs,Global,C:\repos\juhgiyo_EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\INeuron.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LEARNING_RATE
Unutilized Abstraction,EpNeuralEngine.cs,NetworkHelper,C:\repos\juhgiyo_EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\NetworkHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EpNeuralEngine.cs,NeuronLayer,C:\repos\juhgiyo_EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\NeuronLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EpNeuralEngine.cs,Neuron,C:\repos\juhgiyo_EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\Neuron.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Neuron' NeuronCollection
Wide Hierarchy,EpNeuralEngine.cs,NeuralEngineException,C:\repos\juhgiyo_EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\NeuralEngineException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: NeuronStrategyException' NotInitializedException' NetworkHelperException' NeuralNetworkException' NotEnoughLayersException' TrainingException' InvalidInputException' InvalidOutputException' RunningException' StrategyInitializedException
Broken Hierarchy,EpNeuralEngine.cs,NeuronLayer,C:\repos\juhgiyo_EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\EpNeuralEngine.cs\NeuronLayer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NeuronCollection
