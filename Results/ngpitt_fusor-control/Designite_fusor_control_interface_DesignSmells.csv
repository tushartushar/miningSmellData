Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,fusor_control_interface,ControlForm,C:\repos\ngpitt_fusor-control\fusor_control_interface\fusor_control_interface\ControlForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: setMenu
Multifaceted Abstraction,fusor_control_interface,ControlForm,C:\repos\ngpitt_fusor-control\fusor_control_interface\fusor_control_interface\ControlForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Deficient Encapsulation,fusor_control_interface,ControlForm,C:\repos\ngpitt_fusor-control\fusor_control_interface\fusor_control_interface\ControlForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: port_name' update_interval' serial_port' samples' splines' constants
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,fusor_control_interface,ControlForm,C:\repos\ngpitt_fusor-control\fusor_control_interface\fusor_control_interface\ControlForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ControlForm' CalibrationForm
Insufficient Modularization,fusor_control_interface,CalibrationForm,C:\repos\ngpitt_fusor-control\fusor_control_interface\fusor_control_interface\CalibrationForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Broken Modularization,fusor_control_interface.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\ngpitt_fusor-control\fusor_control_interface\fusor_control_interface\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' PortName' UpdateInterval' LogFileName' Samples' Splines' Constants' defaultInstance
