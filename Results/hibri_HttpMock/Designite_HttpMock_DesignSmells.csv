Unnecessary Abstraction,HttpMock,HttpHeaderNames,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\HttpHeaderNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ContentType' ContentLength
Unutilized Abstraction,HttpMock,IHttpMockRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\IHttpMockRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,HttpMock,RequestHandlerList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\RequestHandlerList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,HttpMock,RequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMock,IRequestProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\IRequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HttpMock.IRequestProcessor' HttpMock.RequestHandler

Rebellious Hierarchy,HttpMock,VoidLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\LogFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Error' DebugFormat
Rebellious Hierarchy,HttpMock,BufferedBody,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\BufferedBody.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetRequestHeaders
Rebellious Hierarchy,HttpMock,NoBody,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\BufferedBody.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetRequestHeaders
