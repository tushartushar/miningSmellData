Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMock,IRequestProcessor,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\IRequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRequestProcessor' RequestHandler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMock,IRequestProcessor,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\IRequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRequestProcessor' IRequestHandler' RequestProcessor' RequestHandler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMock,IRequestProcessor,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\IRequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRequestProcessor' IRequestHandler' RequestMatcher' RequestProcessor' RequestHandler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMock,IMatchingRule,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\IMatchingRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMatchingRule' RequestProcessor' RequestHandler' IRequestProcessor' IRequestHandler
Insufficient Modularization,HttpMock,RequestHandler,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HttpMock,RequestProcessor,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\RequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RequestProcessor' RequestHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,HttpMock,BufferedBody,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\BufferedBody.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetRequestHeaders
Rebellious Hierarchy,HttpMock,NoBody,F:\newReposMay17\hibri_HttpMock\src\HttpMock\BufferedBody.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetRequestHeaders
