Unutilized Abstraction,uFluent.Tests.Unit.Extensions.Enum,EnumExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dev-mag_uFluent\Tests\Unit\uFluent.Tests.Unit\Extensions\Enum\EnumExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uFluent.Tests.Unit.Extensions.MultiNodeTreePicker,MultiNodeTreePickerExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dev-mag_uFluent\Tests\Unit\uFluent.Tests.Unit\Extensions\MultiNodeTreePicker\MultiNodeTreePickerExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,uFluent.Tests.Unit.Utils.XPathFilters,DocTypeListXPathTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dev-mag_uFluent\Tests\Unit\uFluent.Tests.Unit\Utils\XPathFilters\DocTypeListXPathTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,uFluent.Tests.Unit.Utils.XPathFilters,DocTypeListXPathTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dev-mag_uFluent\Tests\Unit\uFluent.Tests.Unit\Utils\XPathFilters\DocTypeListXPathTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Modularization,uFluent.Tests.Unit.Utils.XPathFilters,DocTypeListXPathTestsConsts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dev-mag_uFluent\Tests\Unit\uFluent.Tests.Unit\Utils\XPathFilters\DocTypeListXPathTestsConsts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' OneDocTypeDocListXPath' TwoDocTypeDocListXPath' ThreeDocTypeDocListXPath' OneDocTypeUnderScore' TwoDocTypeUnderscore' TwoDocTypeSecondUnderscore' OneDocTypeSpecialCharacters' TwoDocTypeSpecialCharacters' TwoDocTypeNonPipeDelimited' ThreeDocTypeSpecialCharacter' ThreeDocTypeLastNodeNonPipeDelimited' DocTypeBeingAddedAlreadyExists' DocTypeBeingAddedIsEmptyOrNull' DocTypeBeingRemovedDoesntExist' DocTypeBeingRemovedIsEmptyOrNull' AddDocTypeWithSpecialCharacterExceptionMessage' RemoveDocTypeWithSpecialCharacterExceptionMessage
