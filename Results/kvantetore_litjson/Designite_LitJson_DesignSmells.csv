Duplicate Abstraction,LitJson,FsmContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FsmContext (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs' [331' 362])' FsmContext (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs' [369' 400])
Imperative Abstraction,LitJson,Lexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: NextToken
Deficient Encapsulation,LitJson,PropertyMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Info' IsField' Type
Deficient Encapsulation,LitJson,WriterContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Count' InArray' InObject' ExpectingValue' Padding
Deficient Encapsulation,LitJson,FsmContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Return' NextState' L' StateStack
Insufficient Modularization,LitJson,JsonData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 49 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LitJson,JsonData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
Broken Modularization,LitJson,ArrayMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ElementType' IsArray' IsList' element_type' is_array' is_list
Broken Modularization,LitJson,ObjectMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ElementType' IsDictionary' Properties' element_type' is_dictionary' properties
Insufficient Modularization,LitJson,JsonMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
