Imperative Abstraction,LitJson,Lexer,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: NextToken
Deficient Encapsulation,LitJson,PropertyMetadata,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Info' IsField' Type
Deficient Encapsulation,LitJson,WriterContext,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Count' InArray' InObject' ExpectingValue' Padding
Deficient Encapsulation,LitJson,FsmContext,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Return' NextState' L' StateStack
Insufficient Modularization,LitJson,JsonData,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 49 methods
Broken Modularization,LitJson,ArrayMetadata,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ElementType' IsArray' IsList' element_type' is_array' is_list
Broken Modularization,LitJson,ObjectMetadata,C:\repos\kvantetore_litjson\src\LitJson\JsonMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
