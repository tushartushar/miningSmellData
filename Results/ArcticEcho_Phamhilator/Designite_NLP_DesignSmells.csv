Imperative Abstraction,Phamhilator.NLP,PosTagger,C:\repos\ArcticEcho_Phamhilator\NLP\PosTagger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetModel
Unutilized Abstraction,Phamhilator.NLP,StringTools,C:\repos\ArcticEcho_Phamhilator\NLP\StringTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Phamhilator.NLP,Term,C:\repos\ArcticEcho_Phamhilator\NLP\Term.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DocumentIDsByTFs' Value' IDF
