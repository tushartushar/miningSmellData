Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NQuery.UI,ActiproLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\ActiproLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NQuery.UI,ActiproLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\ActiproLink.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetScopeInfo which is more interested in members of the type: Evaluatable
Unnecessary Abstraction,NQuery.UI,MemberEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\MemberAcceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ImageIndex' Description
Unutilized Abstraction,NQuery.UI,SqlDynamicSyntaxLanguage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\SqlDynamicSyntaxLanguage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NQuery.UI,MemberEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\MemberAcceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ImageIndex' Description
Insufficient Modularization,NQuery.UI,ActiproLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\ActiproLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,NQuery.UI,ScopeInfoBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Src\NQuery.UI.Actipro40\ScopeInfoBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AcceptMethod' AcceptTable' AcceptTableRef' AcceptColumnRef' AcceptProperty' AcceptParameter' AcceptConstant' AcceptRelation
