Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NQuery.Samples.CustomTable.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Samples\Extensibility\CustomTable\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,NQuery.Samples.CustomTable,MyTableData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Samples\Extensibility\CustomTable\MyTableBinding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ColumnNames' ColumnTypes' Rows' _columnNames' _columnTypes' _rows
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NQuery.Samples.CustomTable,MyColumnBinding,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terrajobst_NQuery\Samples\Extensibility\CustomTable\MyTableBinding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NQuery.Samples.CustomTable.MyColumnBinding' NQuery.Samples.CustomTable.MyTableBinding
