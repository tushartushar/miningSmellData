Unnecessary Abstraction,Salesforce.Force,BulkConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\developerforce_Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET\src\ForceToolkitForNET\BulkConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Salesforce.Force,ForceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\developerforce_Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET\src\ForceToolkitForNET\ForceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 47 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Salesforce.Force,ForceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\developerforce_Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET\src\ForceToolkitForNET\ForceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Salesforce.Force,ForceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\developerforce_Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET\src\ForceToolkitForNET\ForceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 123
Insufficient Modularization,Salesforce.Force,IForceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\developerforce_Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET\src\ForceToolkitForNET\IForceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
