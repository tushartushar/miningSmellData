Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,HydraPaper,frmMain,C:\repos\gyphie_hydrawallpaper\HydraWallPaper\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Unutilized Abstraction,HydraPaper,Ext,C:\repos\gyphie_hydrawallpaper\HydraWallPaper\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,HydraPaper,WallPaperBuilder,C:\repos\gyphie_hydrawallpaper\HydraWallPaper\WallPaperBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: WallPaperBuilder[136' 168]' WallPaperBuilder[283' 315]
Duplicate Abstraction,HydraPaper,WallPaperBuilder,C:\repos\gyphie_hydrawallpaper\HydraWallPaper\WallPaperBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
