Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,MarsMiner.Shared,MarsMiner.Shared,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: MarsMiner.Shared' MarsMiner.Shared.Geometry,MarsMiner.Shared.CorePlugin' MarsMiner.Shared.Geometry.PerlinGenerator
Unstable Dependency,MarsMiner.Shared,MarsMiner.Shared.Geometry,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MarsMiner.Shared,MarsMiner.Shared.Geometry.Tools' MarsMiner.Shared.Geometry.Plugin
Feature Concentration,MarsMiner.Shared,MarsMiner.Shared.Networking,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LocalConnection]' [PacketType' RemoteNetworkedObject' DisconnectReason]' [NetworkConstants]' [MessageType]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67,MarsMiner.Shared.Networking.LocalConnection' MarsMiner.Shared.Networking.NetworkConstants' MarsMiner.Shared.Networking.MessageType
