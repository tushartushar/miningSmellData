Duplicate Abstraction,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,IBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferInterfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IBuffer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferInterfaces.cs' [1' 22])' ManagedBuffer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferObjects.cs' [1' 22])' MemoryBlock (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\MemoryObjects.cs' [1' 22])
Duplicate Abstraction,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,IBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferInterfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IBuffer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferInterfaces.cs' [1' 20])' IMemoryBlock (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\MemoryInterfaces.cs' [1' 20])' ManagedBuffer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferObjects.cs' [1' 20])' MemoryBlock (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\MemoryObjects.cs' [1' 20])
Duplicate Abstraction,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,ManagedBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferObjects.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ManagedBuffer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\BufferObjects.cs' [1' 26])' MemoryBlock (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\MemoryObjects.cs' [1' 26])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,IMemoryBlock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\MemoryInterfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartLocation' EndLocation' Length' Slab
Unutilized Abstraction,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,BufferStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\StreamObjects.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,FreeSpace,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\MemoryObjects.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Offset' Length
Rebellious Hierarchy,ServerToolkit.BufferManagement,BufferStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tenor_ServerToolkit\BufferPool\src\StreamObjects.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Read' Seek' SetLength' Write
