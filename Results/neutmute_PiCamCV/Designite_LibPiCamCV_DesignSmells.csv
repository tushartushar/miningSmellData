Unutilized Abstraction,PiCamCV.ExtensionMethods,MCvScalarExtensions,C:\repos\neutmute_PiCamCV\source\LibPiCamCV\ExtensionMethods\MvScalarExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PiCamCV.Interfaces,CaptureGrabExtentions,C:\repos\neutmute_PiCamCV\source\LibPiCamCV\Interfaces\ICaptureGrab.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,PiCamCV,PiCameraConfig,C:\repos\neutmute_PiCamCV\source\LibPiCamCV\PiCameraConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Width' Height' Bitrate' Framerate' Monochrome
Broken Hierarchy,PiCamCV,CaptureUsb,C:\repos\neutmute_PiCamCV\source\LibPiCamCV\CaptureUsb.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PiCamCV.CaptureEmgu
Broken Hierarchy,PiCamCV,CaptureFile,C:\repos\neutmute_PiCamCV\source\LibPiCamCV\CaptureUsb.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PiCamCV.CaptureEmgu
