Unnecessary Abstraction,Wyam.Docs,DocsTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\somedave_Wyam\src\recipes\Wyam.Docs\DocsTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Docs' Title' Header' HasSummary' LinkTypeArguments
Unutilized Abstraction,Wyam.Docs,DocsTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\somedave_Wyam\src\recipes\Wyam.Docs\DocsTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
