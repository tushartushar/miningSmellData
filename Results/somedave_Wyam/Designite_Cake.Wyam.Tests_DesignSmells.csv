Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Cake.Wyam.Tests,WyamRunnerFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\somedave_Wyam\tests\clients\Cake.Wyam.Tests\WyamRunnerFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
