Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.UserControls,UserUserControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\UserControls\UserUserControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetupKinect which is more interested in members of the type: MyKinect
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\obj\x86\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Kinect.GestureDetection.Models,GestureDetection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\Models\GestureDetection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ObservationLength
Broken Hierarchy,Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels.ResourcesViewModelBase
