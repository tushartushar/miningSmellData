Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.UserControls,UserUserControl,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\UserControls\UserUserControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels,MainViewModel,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels,ResourcesViewModelBase,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\ViewModels\ResourcesViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels,TrackingViewModel,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\ViewModels\TrackingViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection,MainWindow,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kinect.GestureDetection.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\obj\x86\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Kinect.GestureDetection.Models,GestureDetection,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\Models\GestureDetection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ObservationLength
Broken Hierarchy,Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels,MainViewModel,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\GestureDetection\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Kinect.GestureDetection.ViewModels.ResourcesViewModelBase
