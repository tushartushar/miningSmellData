Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Kinect.MouseControl,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\MouseControl\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Kinect.MouseControl.App' MouseControl.App
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.MouseControl,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\MouseControl\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.MouseControl.ViewModels,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\MouseControl\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Kinect.MouseControl.ViewModels,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\MouseControl\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetUpKinect which is more interested in members of the type: MyKinect
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kinect.MouseControl.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\MouseControl\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\MouseControl\obj\x86\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
