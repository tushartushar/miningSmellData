Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Kinect.Plugins.Common,KinectManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\KinectManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StartKinect which is more interested in members of the type: MyKinect
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.Plugins.Common.Views,PresentationOverlay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\Views\PresentationOverlay.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Kinect.Plugins.Common.ViewModels,PowerpointOverlayViewModelBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\ViewModels\PowerpointOverlayViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Cleanup
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.Plugins.Common.ViewModels,PowerpointOverlayViewModelBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\ViewModels\PowerpointOverlayViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Kinect.Plugins.Common.ViewModels,PowerpointOverlayViewModelBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\ViewModels\PowerpointOverlayViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitializeKinect which is more interested in members of the type: KinectManager
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Kinect.Plugins.Common,KinectManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\KinectManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kinect.Plugins.Common,KinectManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\Microsoft Office\Plugins.Common\KinectManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kinect.Plugins.Common.KinectManager' Kinect.Plugins.Common.ViewModels.CalibrationViewModel
