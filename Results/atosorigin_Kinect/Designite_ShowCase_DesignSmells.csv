Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,Ball,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,Ball,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Ball (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs' [42' 70])' GradientBall (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\GradientBall.cs' [57' 85])

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Ball (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs' [96' 122])' GradientBall (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\GradientBall.cs' [108' 134])
Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Kinect.ShowCase,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitKinect which is more interested in members of the type: MyKinect
Feature Envy,Kinect.ShowCase,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Window_KeyUp which is more interested in members of the type: MyKinect
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,Kinect.ShowCase,DEVMODE,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\ChangeResolution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dmDeviceName' dmSpecVersion' dmDriverVersion' dmSize' dmDriverExtra' dmFields' dmOrientation' dmPaperSize' dmPaperLength' dmPaperWidth' dmScale' dmCopies' dmDefaultSource' dmPrintQuality' dmColor' dmDuplex' dmYResolution' dmTTOption' dmCollate' dmFormName' dmUnusedPadding' dmBitsPerPel' dmPelsWidth' dmPelsHeight' dmDisplayFlags' dmDisplayFrequency
