Unutilized Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,Ball,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,Ball,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Ball (C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs' [42' 70])' GradientBall (C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\GradientBall.cs' [57' 85])
Duplicate Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,Ball,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Ball (C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Ball.cs' [96' 122])' GradientBall (C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\GradientBall.cs' [108' 134])
Imperative Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase,MainWindow,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitializeComponent

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kinect.ShowCase.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,Kinect.ShowCase,DEVMODE,C:\repos\atosorigin_Kinect\src\Demos\ShowCase\ChangeResolution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dmDeviceName' dmSpecVersion' dmDriverVersion' dmSize' dmDriverExtra' dmFields' dmOrientation' dmPaperSize' dmPaperLength' dmPaperWidth' dmScale' dmCopies' dmDefaultSource' dmPrintQuality' dmColor' dmDuplex' dmYResolution' dmTTOption' dmCollate' dmFormName' dmUnusedPadding' dmBitsPerPel' dmPelsWidth' dmPelsHeight' dmDisplayFlags' dmDisplayFrequency
