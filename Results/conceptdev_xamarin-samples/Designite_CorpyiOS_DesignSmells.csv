(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SQLiteClient,IBusinessEntity,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteCrudDatabase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SQLiteClient,SQLiteException,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SQLiteException' SQLite3
Insufficient Modularization,SQLiteClient,SQLiteConnection,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SQLiteClient,TableMapping,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TableMapping' SQLiteCommand' PreparedSqlLiteInsertCommand
Insufficient Modularization,SQLiteClient,SQLite3,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SQLiteClient,SQLite3,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Corpy,AppDelegate,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
Broken Hierarchy,SQLiteClient,SQLiteCrudDatabase,F:\newReposMay17\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\Corpy\CorpyiOS\Core\SQLiteCrudDatabase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SQLiteConnection
