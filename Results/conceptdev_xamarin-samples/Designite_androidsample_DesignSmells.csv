Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,androidsample,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\Resources\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateIdValues
Unutilized Abstraction,androidsample,Attribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\Resources\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,androidsample,Drawable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\Resources\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,androidsample,String,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\Resources\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,androidsample,Style,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\Resources\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,androidsample,ToDoItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\ToDoItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Text' Complete
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,androidsample,ToDoActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\ToDoActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: androidsample.ToDoActivity' androidsample.ToDoItemAdapter
Missing Hierarchy,androidsample,ToDoItemAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\conceptdev_xamarin-samples\AzureWebinarSample\Components\azure-mobile-services-1.1.0\samples\androidsample\androidsample\ToDoItemAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ToDoItemWrapper' ToDoActivity (in method "GetView" of class "ToDoItemAdapter").
