Insufficient Modularization,System.Web.WebPages.Administration.Test,AdminPackageTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.WebPages.Administration.Test\AdminPackageTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Web.WebPages.Administration.Test,NeverCloseMemoryStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.WebPages.Administration.Test\WebProjectSystemTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose
