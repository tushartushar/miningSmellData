Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,Microsoft.Web.Helpers,Microsoft.Web.Helpers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): System.Web.WebPages.Razor
Feature Concentration,Microsoft.Web.Helpers,Microsoft.Web.Helpers,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Analytics]' [Bing]' [Facebook' UrlBuilder' ReCaptcha' VirtualPathUtilityBase' VirtualPathUtilityWrapper' Video]' [FileUpload]' [GamerCard]' [LinkShare' LinkShareSite]' [Maps]' [Gravatar' GravatarRating]' [PreApplicationStartCode]' [Themes' ThemesImplementation]' [Twitter]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.58
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.69  All the dependencies among components: from: Microsoft.Web.Helpers' to: System.Web.WebPages' from: Microsoft.Web.Helpers' to: System.Web.WebPages.Scope' from:
