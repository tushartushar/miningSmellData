Unutilized Abstraction,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,MaxHttpCollectionKeyTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\MaxHttpCollectionKeyTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,DeepNestedTypeTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\DeeplyNestedTypeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,Nest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\DeeplyNestedTypeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: A
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,MyList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\DeeplyNestedTypeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: D' N
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,HttpSelfHostConfigurationTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\HttpSelfHostConfigurationTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,HttpSelfHostConfigurationTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\HttpSelfHostConfigurationTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,MaxHttpCollectionKeyTypeController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\MaxHttpCollectionKeyTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Web.Http.ApiController
Broken Hierarchy,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,DeepNestedTypeController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\DeeplyNestedTypeTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Web.Http.ApiController
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,ThrowsBeforeTaskObjectContent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\HttpSelfHostServerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SerializeToStreamAsync
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Web.Http.SelfHost,ThrowBeforeWriteStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnetwebstack_aspnetwebstack\test\System.Web.Http.SelfHost.Test\HttpSelfHostServerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
