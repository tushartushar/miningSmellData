Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Ambiguous Interface,Algorithm,Algorithm.Inheritance,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: PointsAggregator,Algorithm.Inheritance.PointsAggregator
Feature Concentration,Algorithm,Algorithm.Composition,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AveragingStrategy' IAggregationStrategy' PointsAggregator' SummingStrategy' EmptyFilter' IMeasurementFilter' LowPassFilter]' [HighPassFilter]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,Algorithm.Composition.HighPassFilter
