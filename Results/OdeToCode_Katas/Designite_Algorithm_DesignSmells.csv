Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Algorithm.Composition,HighPassFilter,C:\repos\OdeToCode_Katas\Composition\CS\Composition\Algorithm\Composition\HighPassFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Algorithm.Composition,HighPassFilter,C:\repos\OdeToCode_Katas\Composition\CS\Composition\Algorithm\Composition\HighPassFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Algorithm.Composition,PointsAggregator,C:\repos\OdeToCode_Katas\Composition\CS\Composition\Algorithm\Composition\PointsAggregator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Algorithm.Composition.PointsAggregator' Algorithm.Inheritance.PointsAggregator
Unnecessary Abstraction,Algorithm.Inheritance,HighPassSummingAggregator,C:\repos\OdeToCode_Katas\Composition\CS\Composition\Algorithm\Inheritance\HighPassSummingAggregator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Algorithm.Inheritance,HighPassSummingAggregator,C:\repos\OdeToCode_Katas\Composition\CS\Composition\Algorithm\Inheritance\HighPassSummingAggregator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Algorithm,Measurement,C:\repos\OdeToCode_Katas\Composition\CS\Composition\Algorithm\Measurement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
