Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,ODatabaseCrudTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ODatabaseCrudTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Tests,ODatabaseCrudTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ODatabaseCrudTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ODatabaseCrudTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ODatabaseCrudTests.cs' [39' 67])' ODatabaseCrudTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ODatabaseCrudTests.cs' [157' 185])

Feature Envy,Tests,ODatabaseCrudTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ODatabaseCrudTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Dispose which is more interested in members of the type: OServer
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,ODatabasePoolTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ODatabasePoolTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests,TestNestedClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\TestingPocos.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NestedString' StringArray' StringList
Insufficient Modularization,Tests,ORecordParsingTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ORecordParsingTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Tests,ORecordParsingTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\ORecordParsingTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Modularization,Tests,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yojimbo87_Eastern\src\Tests\TestingPocos.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Null' IsBool' ByteNumber' ShortNumber' IntNumber' LongNumber' FloatNumber' DoubleNumber' DecimalNumber' DateTime' String' StringArray' StringList' NestedClass' ObjectList' SingleOrid' OridList
