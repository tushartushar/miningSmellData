Unnecessary Abstraction,IpWatchDog,StringConstants,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\StringConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ServiceName' ServiceDisplayName' ServiceDescription
Unutilized Abstraction,IpWatchDog.Install,ProjectInstaller,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Install\ProjectInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IpWatchDog,Configurator,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Configurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IpWatchDog.Configurator' IpWatchDog.Program' IpWatchDog.Install.InstallUtil
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IpWatchDog,Configurator,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Configurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IpWatchDog.Configurator' IpWatchDog.Program' IpWatchDog.Install.InstallUtil
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IpWatchDog,Program,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IpWatchDog.Program' IpWatchDog.Install.InstallUtil
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IpWatchDog,Program,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IpWatchDog.Program' IpWatchDog.Install.InstallUtil' IpWatchDog.Configurator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IpWatchDog.Install,InstallUtil,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Install\InstallUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IpWatchDog.Install.InstallUtil' IpWatchDog.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IpWatchDog.Install,InstallUtil,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\Network\IpWatchdog\IpWatchDog\Install\InstallUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IpWatchDog.Install.InstallUtil' IpWatchDog.Configurator' IpWatchDog.Program
