Unnecessary Abstraction,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,InvalidChangeTokenEventArgs,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\InvalidChangeTokenEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EventMessage
Unnecessary Abstraction,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,WizardOperationSettings,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\WizardOperationSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Settings
Unutilized Abstraction,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,WizardStsadmCommand,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\WizardStsadmCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,ChangeTokenStore,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\ChangeTokenStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Items
Deficient Encapsulation,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,ExportOperationResult,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\OperationResults\ExportOperationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: f_changeToken
Unexploited Encapsulation,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,WizardStsadmCommand,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\WizardStsadmCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: WizardExportSettings' WizardImportSettings (in method "validateSettings" of class "WizardStsadmCommand").
Insufficient Modularization,COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core,WizardDeployment,C:\repos\chrisdee_Tools\SharePoint\SharePointContentDeploymentWizard\SPDeploymentWizard_Beta2.8_Source\COB.SharePoint.Utilities.DeploymentWizard.Core\WizardDeployment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
