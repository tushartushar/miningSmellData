Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,ComputedAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\ComputedAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,DecompileAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\DecompileAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,DecompileExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\DecompileExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 232
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Address,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DelegateDecompiler.Address' DelegateDecompiler.Processor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DelegateDecompiler.Configuration' DelegateDecompiler.DefaultConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Address,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DelegateDecompiler.Address' DelegateDecompiler.VariableInfo' DelegateDecompiler.Processor
Cyclic Hierarchy,DelegateDecompiler,Configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DefaultConfiguration
