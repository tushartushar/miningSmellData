Unnecessary Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,ComputedAttribute,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\ComputedAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,ComputedExtension,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\ComputedExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,DecompileAttribute,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\DecompileAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,DecompileExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\DecompileExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,MethodBodyDecompiler,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\MethodBodyDecompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,OptimizeExpressionVisitor,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\OptimizeExpressionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Visit
Imperative Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,Processor,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Process
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Address,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Address' Processor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Address,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Address' VariableInfo' Processor
Insufficient Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Processor,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,Processor,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 249
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DelegateDecompiler,VariableInfo,F:\newReposMay17\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\VariableInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VariableInfo' Processor' Address' Processor' Address
