Unnecessary Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,ComputedAttribute,C:\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\ComputedAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,DecompileAttribute,C:\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\DecompileAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DelegateDecompiler,DecompiledQueryable<T>,C:\repos\hazzik_DelegateDecompiler\src\DelegateDecompiler\DecompiledQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
