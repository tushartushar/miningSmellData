Unnecessary Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,TrailingClassificationTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\Classifier\ClassificationTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TrailingWhitespace' Whitespace
Unutilized Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,TrailingWhitespaceFormatDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\Classifier\ClassificationTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,TrailingClassifierProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\Classifier\ClassifierProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,PackageGuids,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\VSCommandTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidVSPackageString' guidVSPackage' guidVSPackageCmdSetString' guidVSPackageCmdSet
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,PackageIds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\VSCommandTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,PackageIds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\VSCommandTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TrailingWhitespace,TextviewCreationListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\Commands\TextviewCreationListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TrailingWhitespace,PackageGuids,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\VSCommandTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: guidVSPackage' guidVSPackageCmdSet
Deficient Encapsulation,TrailingWhitespace,PackageGuids,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\VSCommandTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: guidVSPackage' guidVSPackageCmdSet
Broken Modularization,TrailingWhitespace,Vsix,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\madskristensen_TrailingWhitespace\src\source.extension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Name' Description' Language' Version' Author' Tags
