Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,EntityFramework.Extended.net40,EntityFramework.Caching,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: EntityFramework.Caching' EntityFramework
Unstable Dependency,EntityFramework.Extended.net40,EntityFramework,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EntityFramework.Caching
Ambiguous Interface,EntityFramework.Extended.net40,EntityFramework.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: ExpressionVisitor
Feature Concentration,EntityFramework.Extended.net40,EntityFramework.Caching,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CacheExpirationMode' CachePolicy' ICacheProvider' CacheTag' MemoryCacheProvider' CacheKey' CacheManager]' [Evaluator' QueryCache' LocalCollectionExpander]' [Utility]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.27
Feature Concentration,EntityFramework.Extended.net40,EntityFramework.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AuditExtensions]' [CacheExtensions]' [DataRecordExtensions]' [BatchExtensions]' [ObjectContextExtensions]' [ExpressionExtensions' ExpressionVisitor]' [ObjectQueryExtensions]' [FutureExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.89
Scattered Functionality,EntityFramework.Extended.net40,EntityFramework.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: EntityFramework.Caching' EntityFramework
