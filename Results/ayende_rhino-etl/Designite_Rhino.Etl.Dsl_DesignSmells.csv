Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl,EtlDslEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\EtlDslEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,AbstractClassGeneratorMacro<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\AbstractClassGeneratorMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Expand
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,AggregateMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\AggregateMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,HashJoinMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\HashJoinMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetupJoinMethodDefinition which is more interested in members of the type: JoinType
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,InputMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\InputMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,OperationMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\OperationMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,OutputMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\OutputMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,ProcessMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\ProcessMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,SqlBulkInsertMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\SqlBulkInsertMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,FullJoinMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\FullJoinMacro.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros.HashJoinMacro
Broken Hierarchy,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,InnerJoinMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\InnerJoinMacro.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros.HashJoinMacro
Broken Hierarchy,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,LeftJoinMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\LeftJoinMacro.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros.HashJoinMacro
Broken Hierarchy,Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros,RightJoinMacro,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_rhino-etl\Rhino.Etl.Dsl\Macros\RightJoinMacro.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rhino.Etl.Dsl.Macros.HashJoinMacro
