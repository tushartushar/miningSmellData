Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NetHookAnalyzer,MainForm,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NetHookAnalyzer,MessageTypeOverrides,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\MessageTypeOverrides.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BodyMap' GCBodyMap
Unutilized Abstraction,NetHookAnalyzer,StringExtensions,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NetHookAnalyzer.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,NetHookAnalyzer,MessageTypeOverrides,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\MessageTypeOverrides.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BodyMap' GCBodyMap
Deficient Encapsulation,NetHookAnalyzer,MessageTypeOverrides,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\MessageTypeOverrides.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: BodyMap' GCBodyMap
Missing Hierarchy,NetHookAnalyzer,SessionForm,C:\repos\SteamRE_SteamKit\Resources\NetHookAnalyzer\NetHookAnalyzer\SessionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CMsgGCClient' CMsgClientServiceMethod (in method "Dump" of class "SessionForm").
