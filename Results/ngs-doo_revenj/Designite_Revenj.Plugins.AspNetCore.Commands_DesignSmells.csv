Duplicate Abstraction,Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands,DomainMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\Middleware\DomainMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DomainMiddleware (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\Middleware\DomainMiddleware.cs' [22' 41])' ReportingMiddleware (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\Middleware\ReportingMiddleware.cs' [24' 43])
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting,RevenjBuilderExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\RevenjBuilderExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting,RevenjBuilderExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\RevenjBuilderExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.RevenjBuilderExtension' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RevenjBuilderExtension
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,RevenjBuilderExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\RevenjBuilderExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands,Try,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Plugins\Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands\Try.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands.Try' Revenj.Plugins.AspNetCore.Commands.Utility
