Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,AdditionalCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\AdditionalCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Argument' CommandType' ToHeader
Unnecessary Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,ObjectCommandDescription,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\Descriptions\ObjectCommandDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequestID' Data' CommandType
Unutilized Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,PassThroughSerialization,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\PassThroughSerialization.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,ExecuteResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\RestApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Error' Result
Multifaceted Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,RevenjConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\RevenjConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.82
Feature Envy,Revenj.AspNetCore,RevenjConfigFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\RevenjConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateFactory which is more interested in members of the type: RevenjConfig
Unnecessary Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,FactoryBuilderInstance,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\RevenjConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance' AsType
Unutilized Abstraction,Revenj.AspNetCore,Utility,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\Utility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting,RevenjWebHostBuilderExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\RevenjWebHostBuilderExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Revenj.AspNetCore,ExecuteResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngs-doo_revenj\csharp\Server\Revenj.AspNetCore\RestApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Error' Result
