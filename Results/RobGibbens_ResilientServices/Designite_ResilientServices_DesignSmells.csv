Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ResilientServices,LinkerPreserve,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\AkavacheSqliteLinkerOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ResilientServices,PreserveAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\AkavacheSqliteLinkerOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,ResilientServices,PreserveAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\AkavacheSqliteLinkerOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ResilientServices.PreserveAttribute' RefitInternalGenerated.PreserveAttribute
Unutilized Abstraction,ResilientServices,AsyncErrorHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Utils\AsyncErrorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ResilientServices.Services,IApiService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Services\IApiService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Speculative' UserInitiated' Background
Feature Envy,ResilientServices.Services,ConferencesService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Services\ConferencesService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetRemoteConferencesAsync which is more interested in members of the type: IApiService
Feature Envy,ResilientServices.Services,ConferencesService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Services\ConferencesService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetRemoteConference which is more interested in members of the type: IApiService
Unnecessary Abstraction,RefitInternalGenerated,PreserveAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\RefitStubs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AllMembers' Conditional
Deficient Encapsulation,RefitInternalGenerated,PreserveAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\RefitStubs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AllMembers' Conditional
Broken Modularization,TekConf.Mobile.Core.Dtos,Address,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Dtos\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StreetNumber' StreetName' City' State' PostalArea' Country
Broken Modularization,TekConf.Mobile.Core.Dtos,ConferenceDto,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Dtos\ConferenceDto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Slug' Start' End' Description' ImageUrl' IsAddedToSchedule' IsOnline' Address' Position' Longitude' Latitude' ImageUrlSquare' Sessions' _imageUrlSquare
Broken Modularization,TekConf.Mobile.Core.Dtos,SessionDto,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Dtos\SessionDto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Slug' Title' Start' End' Room' Difficulty' Description' TwitterHashTag' SessionType' IsAddedToSchedule' Speakers
Broken Modularization,TekConf.Mobile.Core.Dtos,SpeakerDto,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobGibbens_ResilientServices\ResilientServices\ResilientServices\Dtos\SpeakerDto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
