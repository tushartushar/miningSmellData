Deficient Encapsulation,TinCanTests,Support,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RusticiSoftware_TinCan.NET\TinCanTests\Support.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: agent' verb' activity' parent' context' result' score' statementRef' subStatement
Deficient Encapsulation,TinCanTests,Support,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RusticiSoftware_TinCan.NET\TinCanTests\Support.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: agent' verb' activity' parent' context' result' score' statementRef' subStatement
Insufficient Modularization,TinCanTests,RemoteLRSResourceTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RusticiSoftware_TinCan.NET\TinCanTests\RemoteLRSResourceTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
