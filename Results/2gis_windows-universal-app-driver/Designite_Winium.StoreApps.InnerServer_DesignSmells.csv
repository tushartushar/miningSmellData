Imperative Abstraction,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer,Automator,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Automator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessCommand
Unutilized Abstraction,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.Helpers,ContorlExtensions,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Commands\Helpers\ControlExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.Helpers,DictionaryExtensions,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Commands\Helpers\IDictionaryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.Helpers,FrameworkElementExtensions,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Commands\Helpers\FrameworkElementExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer,Automator,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Automator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Automator' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.CommandBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands,CommandBase,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Commands\CommandBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.CommandBase' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Automator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Element,WiniumElement,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Element\WiniumElement.GetText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Element.WiniumElement' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Element.WiniumVirtualRoot
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Element,WiniumVirtualRoot,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Element\WiniumVirtualRoot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Element.WiniumVirtualRoot' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Element.WiniumElement
Wide Hierarchy,Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands,CommandBase,C:\repos\2gis_windows-universal-app-driver\Winium\Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer\Commands\CommandBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.ClearCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.GetElementRectCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.GetElementSizeCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.InvokeMethodCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.IsElementEnabledCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.AlertCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.AlertTextCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.CloseAppCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.DisplayedCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.ExecuteCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.ElementCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.ElementsCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.GetElementAttributeCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.LocationCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.LocationInViewCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.OrientationCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.PageSourceCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.GetElementTagNameCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.TextCommand' Winium.StoreApps.InnerServer.Commands.ValueCommand
