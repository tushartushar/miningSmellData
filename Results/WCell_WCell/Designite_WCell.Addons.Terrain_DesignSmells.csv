Unutilized Abstraction,WCell.Addons.Terrain,Extensions,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WCell.Addons.Terrain,zzQuadTree<T>,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\QuadTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WCell.Addons.Terrain,zzQuadTreeNode<T>,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\QuadTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WCell.Addons.Terrain,IBounded,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\QuadTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Bounds
Unutilized Abstraction,WCell.Addons.Terrain,IBounded,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\QuadTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WCell.Addons.Terrain,CollisionAddon,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\CollisionAddon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WCell.Addons.Terrain.CollisionAddon' WCell.Addons.Terrain.TerrainAddonConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WCell.Addons.Terrain,TerrainAddonConfiguration,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\TerrainAddonConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WCell.Addons.Terrain.TerrainAddonConfiguration' WCell.Addons.Terrain.CollisionAddon
Rebellious Hierarchy,WCell.Addons.Terrain,CollisionAddon,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\CollisionAddon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TearDown
Broken Hierarchy,WCell.Addons.Terrain,NavFigurine,C:\repos\WCell_WCell\Addons\WCell.Addons.Terrain\NavFigurine.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WCell.RealmServer.Editor.Figurines.FigurineBase
