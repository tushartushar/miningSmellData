Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel,RedisResolverTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisResolverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RedisResolverTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisResolverTests.cs' [56' 83])' RedisResolverTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisResolverTests.cs' [120' 147])

Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel,RedisSentinelConnectionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisSentinelConnectionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel,FixedResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisResolverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NewClientsInitialized
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel,RedisSentinelTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisSentinelTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DisableLocalServers' MasterHosts' SlaveHosts' SentinelHosts' RedisPorts' SentinelPorts' GoogleCloudSentinelHosts
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel,RedisSentinelTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisSentinelTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DisableLocalServers' MasterHosts' SlaveHosts' SentinelHosts' RedisPorts' SentinelPorts' GoogleCloudSentinelHosts
Rebellious Hierarchy,ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel,FixedResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Redis\tests\ServiceStack.Redis.Tests.Sentinel\RedisResolverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResetMasters' ResetSlaves
