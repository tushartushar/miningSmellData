Deficient Encapsulation,InfoBase,URI,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\Concept.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: title' url
Deficient Encapsulation,InfoBase,ConceptReference,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\Concept.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name' guid
Deficient Encapsulation,InfoBase,User,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\Concept.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name' email' userType' userId
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess.PSP,Configuration,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AppExcuteFilePath' PSP_Data_Path
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess.PSP,Configuration,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AppExcuteFilePath' PSP_Data_Path
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess.PSP,StatisticsItem,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\PSPEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: guid
Insufficient Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,DataHelper,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\DataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,DataHelper,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\DataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,DataHelper,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\DataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 114
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,DataHelper,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\DataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataHelper' PSPEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,DataHelper,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\DataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataHelper' PSPEvent' PSPDay
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,DataHelper,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\DataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataHelper' PSPEvent' PSPDay' PSPWeek
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataAccess.PSP,PSPDay,C:\repos\taurenshaman_psp\PSP.Run.2010\DataAccess.PSP\PSPEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PSPDay' DataHelper' PSPEvent' DataHelper' PSPEvent
