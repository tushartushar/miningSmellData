Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DirectShowVideoCapture,VideoFrame,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoFrame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,DirectShowVideoCapture.VideoCaptureImpl,DirectShowCapture,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoCaptureImpl\DirectShowCapture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Unnecessary Abstraction,DirectShowVideoCapture.VideoCaptureImpl,VideoCameraFrame,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoCaptureImpl\VideoCameraFrame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Pixels' FrameNumber' ImageLayout
Deficient Encapsulation,DirectShowVideoCapture.VideoCaptureImpl,VideoCameraFrame,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoCaptureImpl\VideoCameraFrame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Pixels' FrameNumber' ImageLayout
Deficient Encapsulation,DirectShowVideoCapture.VideoCaptureImpl,VideoCodecs,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoCaptureImpl\VideoCodecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UNCOMPRESSED_VIDEO
Deficient Encapsulation,DirectShowVideoCapture.VideoCaptureImpl,VideoCodecs,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoCaptureImpl\VideoCodecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: UNCOMPRESSED_VIDEO
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture,DriverSettings,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\DriverSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DriverSettings' VideoDriver
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture,DriverSettings,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\DriverSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DriverSettings' VideoCapture' VideoDriver
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture,DriverSettings,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\DriverSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DriverSettings' CrossbarHelper' frmSetupDialog' VideoDriver
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture,DriverSettings,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\DriverSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DriverSettings' CrossbarHelper' DirectShowCapture' VideoCapture' VideoDriver
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture,frmSetupDialog,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\frmSetupDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: frmSetupDialog' VideoDriver' DriverSettings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture,frmSetupDialog,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\frmSetupDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: frmSetupDialog' VideoDriver' DriverSettings' VideoDriver' DriverSettings
Broken Modularization,DirectShowVideoCapture.VideoCaptureImpl,SystemCodecEntry,C:\repos\hpavlov_video.directshowvideocapture\VideoCaptureImpl\VideoCodecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Codec' DeviceName' FourCC' Device' IsInstalled' codec' codecAttribute
