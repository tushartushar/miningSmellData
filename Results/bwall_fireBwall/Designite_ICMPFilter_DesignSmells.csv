Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ICMPFilter,ICMPFilterModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ICMPFilter\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: isAllowed which is more interested in members of the type: ICMPData
Deficient Encapsulation,ICMPFilter,ICMPFilterModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ICMPFilter\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: data
Deficient Encapsulation,ICMPFilter,ICMPData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ICMPFilter\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Save
Broken Modularization,ICMPFilter,ICMPData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ICMPFilter\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RuleTable' RuleTablev6' DenyIPv4' DenyIPv6' DenyIPv6NDP' Log' ruleTable' ruleTablev6' denyIPv4' denyIPv6' denyIPv6NDP' log' Save
Insufficient Modularization,ICMPFilter,ICMPFilterDisplay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ICMPFilter\ICMPFilterDisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 116
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ICMPFilter,ICMPFilterModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ICMPFilter\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ICMPFilter.ICMPFilterModule' ICMPFilter.ICMPFilterDisplay
