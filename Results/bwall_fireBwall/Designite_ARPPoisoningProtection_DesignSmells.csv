Unnecessary Abstraction,ARPPoisoningProtection,ArpData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ARPPoisoningProtection\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' arpCache' Save' LogUnsolic' LogAttacks' RectifyAttacks
Deficient Encapsulation,ARPPoisoningProtection,ARPPoisoningProtectionModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ARPPoisoningProtection\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: data
Deficient Encapsulation,ARPPoisoningProtection,ArpData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ARPPoisoningProtection\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: arpCache' Save' LogUnsolic' LogAttacks' RectifyAttacks
Broken Modularization,ARPPoisoningProtection,ArpData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ARPPoisoningProtection\fireBwallModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' arpCache' Save' LogUnsolic' LogAttacks' RectifyAttacks
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ARPPoisoningProtection,ArpPoisoningProtection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ARPPoisoningProtection\ArpPoisoningProtection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ARPPoisoningProtection.ArpPoisoningProtection' ARPPoisoningProtection.ARPPoisoningProtectionModule
