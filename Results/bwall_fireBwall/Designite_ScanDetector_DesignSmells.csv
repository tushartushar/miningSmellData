Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ScanDetector,Report,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ScanDetector\Report.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateReport
Unnecessary Abstraction,ScanDetector,ScanData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ScanDetector\ScanDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BlockCache' Save' blockImmediately' cloaked_mode
Imperative Abstraction,ScanDetector,ScanDetectorUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ScanDetector\ScanDetectorUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: addPotential
Deficient Encapsulation,ScanDetector,ScanData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ScanDetector\ScanDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BlockCache' Save' blockImmediately' cloaked_mode
Deficient Encapsulation,ScanDetector,ScanDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ScanDetector\ScanDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ip_table' potentials' data' multistring
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScanDetector,ScanDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\ScanDetector\ScanDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScanDetector.ScanDetector' ScanDetector.ScanDetectorUI
