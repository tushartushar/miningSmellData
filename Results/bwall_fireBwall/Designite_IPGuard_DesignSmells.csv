Unnecessary Abstraction,PassThru,GuardData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\IPGuard\IPGuard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Loaded_Lists' loaded_lists' Save' logBlocked' blockIncoming
Deficient Encapsulation,PassThru,IPGuard,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\IPGuard\IPGuard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: data' multistring
