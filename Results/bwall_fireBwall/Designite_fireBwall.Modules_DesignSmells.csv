Cyclic Hierarchy,fireBwall.Packets,UDPPacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\fireBwall.Modules\Packets\UDPPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DNSPacket
Wide Hierarchy,fireBwall.UI,DynamicUserControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bwall_fireBwall\fireBwall\fireBwall.Modules\UI\DynamicUserControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: ARPPoisoningProtection.ArpPoisoningProtection' BasicFirewall.BasicFirewallControl' DDoS.DDoSDisplay' fireBwall.UI.Tabs.AdapterControl' fireBwall.UI.Tabs.AdapterDisplay' fireBwall.UI.Tabs.Help' fireBwall.UI.Tabs.LogDisplay' fireBwall.UI.Tabs.ModuleConfiguration' fireBwall.UI.Tabs.OptionsDisplay' ICMPFilter.ICMPFilterDisplay' PassThru.IPGuardUI' IPMonitor.IPMonitorDisplay' MacFilter.MacFilterControl' ScanDetector.ScanDetectorUI
