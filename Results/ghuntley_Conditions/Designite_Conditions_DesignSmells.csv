Duplicate Abstraction,Conditions,CollectionHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\CollectionHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CollectionHelpers (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\CollectionHelpers.cs' [65' 84])' CollectionHelpers (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\CollectionHelpers.cs' [167' 186])

Unnecessary Abstraction,Conditions,DefaultComparer<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\DefaultComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Default
Unutilized Abstraction,Conditions,DefaultComparer<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\DefaultComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Conditions,ExceptionMessages,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\ExceptionMessages.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Conditions,StringificationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\StringificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Conditions,ValidatorExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\ValidatorExtensions.Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Conditions,Throw,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\Throw.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 72 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Conditions,ValidatorExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\ValidatorExtensions.Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 412 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Conditions,ValidatorExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\ValidatorExtensions.Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 413 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Conditions,ValidatorExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\ValidatorExtensions.Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 789
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Conditions,AlternativeExceptionHelper<TException>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ghuntley_Conditions\src\Conditions\AlternativeExceptionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Conditions.AlternativeExceptionHelper<TException>' Conditions.RequiresWithCustomExceptionValidator<T'TException>
