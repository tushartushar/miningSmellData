Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,AsterNET.Test,CustomIVR,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\CustomIVR.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Service
Duplicate Abstraction,AsterNET.Test,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\Program.cs' [98' 126])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\Program.cs' [246' 274])
Unexploited Encapsulation,AsterNET.Test,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: QueueParamsEvent' QueueMemberEvent (in method "displayQueue" of class "Program").
Unexploited Encapsulation,AsterNET.Test,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: QueueParamsEvent' QueueMemberEvent (in method "checkManagerAPI" of class "Program").
Broken Hierarchy,AsterNET.Test,UserAgentLoginEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET\Asterisk.2013\Asterisk.NET.Test\Asterisk.NET.Test\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AsterNET.Manager.Event.UserEvent
