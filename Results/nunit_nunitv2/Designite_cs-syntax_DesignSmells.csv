Unutilized Abstraction,NUnit.Framework.Tests,AssertSyntaxTests,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\syntax\AssertSyntaxTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,NUnit.Framework.Tests,AssertSyntaxTests,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\syntax\AssertSyntaxTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NUnit.Framework.Tests,AssertSyntaxTests,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\syntax\AssertSyntaxTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Broken Hierarchy,NUnit.Framework.Tests,AssertSyntaxTests,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\syntax\AssertSyntaxTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AssertionHelper
