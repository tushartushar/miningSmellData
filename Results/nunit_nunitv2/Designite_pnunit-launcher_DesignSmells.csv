Unutilized Abstraction,PNUnit.Launcher,Barrier,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\src\PNUnit\launcher\Barrier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PNUnit.Launcher,TestGroup,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\src\PNUnit\launcher\TestConf.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Variables' ParallelTests
Unnecessary Abstraction,PNUnit.Launcher,ParallelTest,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\src\PNUnit\launcher\TestConf.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' Agents' Tests
Deficient Encapsulation,PNUnit.Launcher,Barrier,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\src\PNUnit\launcher\Barrier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
