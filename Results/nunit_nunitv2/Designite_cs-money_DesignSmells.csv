Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NUnit.Samples.Money,MoneyTest,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\MoneyTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NUnit.Samples.Money,IMoney,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\IMoney.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMoney' Money
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NUnit.Samples.Money,IMoney,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\IMoney.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMoney' MoneyBag' Money
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NUnit.Samples.Money,IMoney,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\IMoney.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMoney' Money' MoneyBag' Money
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NUnit.Samples.Money,IMoney,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\IMoney.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMoney' MoneyBag' Money' MoneyBag' Money
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NUnit.Samples.Money,MoneyBag,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\MoneyBag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MoneyBag' Money
Insufficient Modularization,NUnit.Samples.Money,MoneyTest,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\MoneyTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclic Hierarchy,NUnit.Samples.Money,IMoney,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\IMoney.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Money
Cyclic Hierarchy,NUnit.Samples.Money,IMoney,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\IMoney.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MoneyBag
Missing Hierarchy,NUnit.Samples.Money,Money,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\Money.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IMoney' Money (in method "Equals" of class "Money").
Missing Hierarchy,NUnit.Samples.Money,MoneyBag,D:\newReposJune17\nunit_nunitv2\samples\csharp\money\MoneyBag.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IMoney' MoneyBag (in method "Equals" of class "MoneyBag").
