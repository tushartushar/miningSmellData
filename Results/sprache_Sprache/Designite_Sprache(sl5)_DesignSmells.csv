Deficient Encapsulation,Sprache,Parse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Parse.Commented.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LineEnd' LineTerminator
Deficient Encapsulation,Sprache,Parse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Parse.Commented.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LineEnd' LineTerminator
Broken Modularization,Sprache,IComment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\IComment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Single' NewLine' MultiOpen' MultiClose' SingleLineComment' MultiLineComment' AnyComment
Broken Modularization,Sprache,IResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\IResultOfT.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' WasSuccessful' Message' Expectations' Remainder
Insufficient Modularization,Sprache,Parse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Parse.Commented.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 53 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sprache,Parse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Parse.Commented.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sprache,Parse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Parse.Commented.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sprache,CommentParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\CommentParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sprache.CommentParser' Sprache.Parse
Rebellious Hierarchy,Sprache,AbstractOption<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Get
Rebellious Hierarchy,Sprache,None<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sprache_Sprache\src\Sprache\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Get
