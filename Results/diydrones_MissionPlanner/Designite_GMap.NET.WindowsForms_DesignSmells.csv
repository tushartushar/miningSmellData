Unutilized Abstraction,GMap.NET,TilePrefetcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\TilePrefetcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,GMap.NET.WindowsForms,GMapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GMapControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs' [877' 897])' GMapControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs' [916' 936])

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GMapControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs' [1125' 1151])' GMapControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs' [1181' 1207])
Deficient Encapsulation,GMap.NET,TilePrefetcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\TilePrefetcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ShowCompleteMessage' Overlay' Shuffle
Deficient Encapsulation,GMap.NET.WindowsForms,GMapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.

Insufficient Modularization,GMap.NET.WindowsForms,GMapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GMap.NET.WindowsForms,GMapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GMap.NET.WindowsForms,GMapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMap.NET.WindowsForms\GMapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 260
