Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,MissionPlanner,Grid,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\MissionPlanner.Gridv2\..\..\Grid\Grid.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Host2' StartPointLatLngAlt
Deficient Encapsulation,MissionPlanner,Grid,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\MissionPlanner.Gridv2\..\..\Grid\Grid.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Host2' StartPointLatLngAlt
Insufficient Modularization,MissionPlanner,GridUIv2,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\MissionPlanner.Gridv2\GridUIv2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MissionPlanner,GridUIv2,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\MissionPlanner.Gridv2\GridUIv2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 181
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MissionPlanner,GridUIv2,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\MissionPlanner.Gridv2\GridUIv2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GridUIv2' GridPluginv2
