Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,MissionPlanner.Arduino,Chip,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\Arduino\IArduinoComms.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: chips' name' sig1' sig2' sig3' size
Deficient Encapsulation,MissionPlanner.Arduino,Chip,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\Arduino\IArduinoComms.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: chips
Unfactored Hierarchy,MissionPlanner.Arduino,ArduinoSTK,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\Arduino\ArduinoSTK.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
