Feature Envy,wasm,plotly,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\wasm\plotly.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddXY which is more interested in members of the type: RootObject
