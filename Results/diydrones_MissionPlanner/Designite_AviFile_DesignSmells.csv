Duplicate Abstraction,AviFile,AviManager,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\AviFile\AviManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AviManager[213' 232]' AviManager[243' 262]
Deficient Encapsulation,AviFile,Avi,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\AviFile\Avi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PALETTE_SIZE
Deficient Encapsulation,AviFile,Avi,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\AviFile\Avi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PALETTE_SIZE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AviFile,AviManager,F:\newReposMay17\diydrones_MissionPlanner\ExtLibs\AviFile\AviManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AviManager' VideoStream
