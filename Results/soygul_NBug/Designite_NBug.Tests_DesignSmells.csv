Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Functional,SettingsUITests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Functional\SettingsUITests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Functional,DeveloperUITests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Functional\DeveloperUITests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Functional,WinFormsUITests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Functional\WinFormsUITests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Integration,DispatcherTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Integration\DispatcherTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Integration,SettingsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Integration\SettingsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Integration,BugReportTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Integration\BugReportTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Integration,BugReportTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Integration\BugReportTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: NBug.Tests.Integration.BugReportTests' NBug.Tests.Unit.BugReportTests
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Integration,HandlerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Integration\HandlerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Unit,BugReportTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Unit\BugReportTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Unit,BugReportTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Unit\BugReportTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBug.Tests.Unit.Helpers,EmailDestinationBuilderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Unit\Helpers\EmailDestinationBuilderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,NBug.Tests.Integration,SettingsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Integration\SettingsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,NBug.Tests.Tools.Stubs,DummySerializableException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\soygul_NBug\NBug.Tests\Tools\Stubs\DummySerializableException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBug.Core.Util.Serialization.SerializableException
