Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,CommandDispatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\CommandDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,IdGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\IdGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GenerateGuid' _generator
Unutilized Abstraction,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,IdGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\IdGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,IEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\IEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unnecessary Abstraction,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,ICommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\ICommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,EventStoreDomainRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\EventStoreDomainRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EventClrTypeHeader
Deficient Encapsulation,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,InMemoryDomainRespository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\InMemoryDomainRespository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _eventStore
Rebellious Hierarchy,CQRSShop.Infrastructure,DomainRepositoryBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mastoj_CQRSShop\src\CQRSShop.Infrastructure\DomainRepositoryBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Save' GetById
