Unutilized Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.Data,SampleAssignmentServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\Data\SampleAssignmentServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.Data,SampleAssignmentServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\Data\SampleAssignmentServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SampleAssignmentServiceTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\Data\SampleAssignmentServiceTests.cs' [1' 22])' MockAssignmentService (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\Mocks\MockAssignmentService.cs' [1' 22])
Unnecessary Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.Mocks,AsyncResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\Mocks\MockSynchronizeInvoke.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AsyncState' AsyncWaitHandle' CompletedSynchronously' IsCompleted

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.ViewModels,ItemViewModelTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\ViewModels\ItemViewModelTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.ViewModels,LaborViewModelTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\ViewModels\LaborViewModelTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.ViewModels,LoginViewModelTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\ViewModels\LoginViewModelTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FieldService.Tests.ViewModels,PhotoViewModelTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\ViewModels\PhotoViewModelTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,FieldService.Tests.Data,SampleAssignmentServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_prebuilt-apps\FieldService\FieldService.Tests\Data\SampleAssignmentServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
