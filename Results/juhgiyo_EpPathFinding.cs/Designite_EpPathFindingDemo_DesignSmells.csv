Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EpPathFinding.cs,SingletonHolder<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\General\SingletonHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,EpPathFinding.cs,SingletonHolder<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\General\SingletonHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SingletonHolder<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\General\SingletonHolder.cs' [7' 34])' BoxType (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\GridBox.cs' [7' 34])' GridLine (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\GridLine.cs' [7' 34])' ResultBoxType (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\ResultBox.cs' [7' 34])' SearchGridForm (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\SearchGridForm.cs' [7' 34])
Duplicate Abstraction,EpPathFindingDemo,SearchGridForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\SearchGridForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SearchGridForm (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\SearchGridForm.cs' [168' 194])' SearchGridForm (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\SearchGridForm.cs' [253' 279])
Unnecessary Abstraction,PathTest2010.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,EpPathFinding.cs,GridBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\GridBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: x' y' width' height' brush' boxRec' boxType
Deficient Encapsulation,EpPathFinding.cs,GridLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\GridLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fromX' fromY' toX' toY' pen
Deficient Encapsulation,EpPathFinding.cs,ResultBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\juhgiyo_EpPathFinding.cs\EpPathFindingDemo\ResultBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: x' y' width' height' brush' boxRec' boxType
