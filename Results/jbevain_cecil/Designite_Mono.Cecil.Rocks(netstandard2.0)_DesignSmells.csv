Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,DocCommentId,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\DocCommentId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,ILParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\ILParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,ParseContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\ILParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Code' Position' Metadata' Variables' Visitor
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,MethodBodyRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\MethodBodyRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,MethodDefinitionRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\MethodDefinitionRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,ModuleDefinitionRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\ModuleDefinitionRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,ParameterReferenceRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\ParameterReferenceRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,SecurityDeclarationRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\SecurityDeclarationRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,TypeDefinitionRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\TypeDefinitionRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,TypeReferenceRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\TypeReferenceRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,ParseContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\ILParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Code' Position' Metadata' Variables' Visitor
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Cecil.Rocks,MethodBodyRocks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Mono.Cecil.Rocks\MethodBodyRocks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 115
