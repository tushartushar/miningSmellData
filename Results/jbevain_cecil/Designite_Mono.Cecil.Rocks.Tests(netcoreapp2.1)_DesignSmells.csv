Unnecessary Abstraction,N,Nested,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\DocCommentIdTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,N,Nested,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbevain_cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\DocCommentIdTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
