Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
God Component,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 30,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.ISourceFile
Feature Concentration,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MdbReaderProvider' MdbReader' MdbWriterProvider' MdbWriter' SourceFile' SourceMethod]' [MethodEntryExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29,Mono.Cecil.Mdb.MethodEntryExtensions
Scattered Functionality,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Mono.Cecil' Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter,Mono.Cecil.Mixin' Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.MonoSymbolFile' Mono.Cecil.MetadataToken
