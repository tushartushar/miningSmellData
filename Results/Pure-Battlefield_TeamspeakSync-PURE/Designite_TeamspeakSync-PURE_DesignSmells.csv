Multifaceted Abstraction,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Unutilized Abstraction,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TsSync' TsSyncKey
Deficient Encapsulation,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TsSync
Insufficient Modularization,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 82 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 83 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PRoConEvents,TeamspeakSync,C:\repos\Pure-Battlefield_TeamspeakSync-PURE\TeamspeakSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 713
