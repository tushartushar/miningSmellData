Unutilized Abstraction,TwitchChat,ChatLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TwitchChat,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ChatMessageReceived which is more interested in members of the type: ChatOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,TwitchChat,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TwitchChat.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,TwitchChat,ChatLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatLine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ChatMessage' StatusMessage (in method "copy_line" of class "ChatLine").
Insufficient Modularization,TwitchChat,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TwitchChat,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,ChatItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,Subscriber,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TwitchChat.Subscriber' TwitchChat.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,ChatMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TwitchChat.ChatMessage' TwitchChat.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,ChatAction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TwitchChat.ChatAction' TwitchChat.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,StatusMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TwitchChat.StatusMessage' TwitchChat.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,ChatItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TwitchChat.ChatItem' TwitchChat.Subscriber' TwitchChat.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TwitchChat,ChatMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DarkAutumn_WinterBot\WinterBot\TwitchChat\ChatItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
