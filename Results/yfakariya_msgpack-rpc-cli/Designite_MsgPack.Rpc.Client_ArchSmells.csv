Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: MsgPack.Rpc.Client' MsgPack.Rpc.Client.Protocols,MsgPack.Rpc.Client.ErrorInterpreter' MsgPack.Rpc.Client.NotificationMessageAsyncResult' MsgPack.Rpc.Client.Protocols.ClientTransport
Unstable Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MsgPack.Rpc.Client.Protocols,MsgPack.Rpc.Client.ClientResponseContext' MsgPack.Rpc.Client.ClientTransportManager' MsgPack.Rpc.Client.ClientTransport' MsgPack.Rpc.Client.ClientRequestContext
Feature Concentration,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DynamicRpcProxy' RpcClient' RpcClientConfiguration' ErrorInterpreter' RequestMessageAsyncResult' ResultHolder' NotificationMessageAsyncResult]' [FileSystem]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,MsgPack.Rpc.Client.FileSystem
Scattered Functionality,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,MsgPack.Rpc.Client.Protocols,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: MsgPack.Rpc' MsgPack.Rpc.Protocols,MsgPack.Rpc.RpcErrorMessage' MsgPack.Rpc.Protocols.MessageContext' MsgPack.Rpc.Protocols.InboundMessageContext' MsgPack.Rpc.ArraySegmentExtensions' MsgPack.Rpc.ByteArraySegmentStream
