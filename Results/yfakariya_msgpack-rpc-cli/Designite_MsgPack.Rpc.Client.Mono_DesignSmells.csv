Insufficient Modularization,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,RpcClientConfiguration,D:\newReposJune17\yfakariya_msgpack-rpc-cli\src\MsgPack.Rpc.Client.Mono\..\MsgPack.Rpc.Client\Rpc\Client\RpcClientConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MsgPack.Rpc.Client,RpcClientConfiguration,D:\newReposJune17\yfakariya_msgpack-rpc-cli\src\MsgPack.Rpc.Client.Mono\..\MsgPack.Rpc.Client\Rpc\Client\RpcClientConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
