Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch' MsgPack.Rpc.Server
Cyclic Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch' MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Protocols
Cyclic Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch' MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Protocols' MsgPack.Rpc.Server
Unstable Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Protocols,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch
Unstable Dependency,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch' MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Protocols
Ambiguous Interface,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Dispatch.SvcFileInterop,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: SvcDirectiveParserState
Feature Concentration,MsgPack.Rpc.Server,MsgPack.Rpc.Server.Protocols,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ClientShutdownEventArgs' ServerTransport' ServerTransportContract' ServerTransportManager' ServerTransportManagerContract' TcpServerTransport' TcpServerTransportManager' UdpServerTransport' UdpServerTransportManager' ServerResponseContext' ListeningContext' MsgPackRpcServerProtocolsTrace' ServerRequestContext]' [ServerSocketError]' [ServerProcessingState]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.2
