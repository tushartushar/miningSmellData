Unutilized Abstraction,Open.WinKeyboardHook,IKeyboardInterceptor,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\IKeyInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Open.WinKeyboardHook,IKeyboardInterceptor,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\IKeyInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IKeyboardInterceptor[1' 27]' KeyboardInterceptor[1' 27]' KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT[1' 27]
Duplicate Abstraction,Open.WinKeyboardHook,IKeyboardInterceptor,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\IKeyInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IKeyboardInterceptor[1' 26]' SafeWinHandle[1' 26]' KeyboardInterceptor[1' 26]' KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT[1' 26]
Unutilized Abstraction,Open.WinKeyboardHook,KeyboardInterceptor,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\KeyboardInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Open.WinKeyboardHook,KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' KeyCode' ScanCode' Flags' Time' ExtraInfo
Multifaceted Abstraction,Open.WinKeyboardHook,NativeMethods,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Deficient Encapsulation,Open.WinKeyboardHook,KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: KeyCode' ScanCode' Flags' Time' ExtraInfo
Broken Modularization,Open.WinKeyboardHook,KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' KeyCode' ScanCode' Flags' Time' ExtraInfo
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Open.WinKeyboardHook,NativeMethods,C:\repos\lontivero_Open.WinKeyboardHook\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NativeMethods' SafeWinHandle
