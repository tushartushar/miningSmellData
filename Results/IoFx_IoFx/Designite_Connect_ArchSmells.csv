Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Connect,Connect.Sockets,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Connect.Sockets' Connect.Sockets.LenghPrefixed,Connect.Sockets.SocketClientManager' Connect.Sockets.SocketServer' Connect.Sockets.LenghPrefixed.SocketClientWithAck
Unstable Dependency,Connect,Connect.Sockets.LenghPrefixed,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Connect.Sockets,Connect.Sockets.LenghPrefixed.SocketCommandArgs
Feature Concentration,Connect,Connect.Sockets,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SocketClientManager' RawSocketClientManager' SocketClient' SocketCommandArgs' SocketServer' socket]' [CommandEnvironment]' [Utility]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,Connect.Sockets.CommandEnvironment' Connect.Sockets.Utility
Feature Concentration,Connect,Connect,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConnectionType]' [ConnectArgs' ConnectArgsExtension' TestScenario' none' Program]' [IClientManager]' [IServer]' [ConnectionRateMonitor]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.56,Connect.ConnectionType' Connect.IClientManager' Connect.IServer' Connect.ConnectionRateMonitor
Scattered Functionality,Connect,Connect.Sockets,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: IoFx.Sockets' Connect,IoFx.Sockets.SocketEvents' Connect.ConnectionRateMonitor
Scattered Functionality,Connect,Connect.WCF.Channels,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Connect' IoFx.ServiceModel,Connect.ConnectArgsExtension' IoFx.ServiceModel.ChannelExtensions' Connect.ConnectionRateMonitor
