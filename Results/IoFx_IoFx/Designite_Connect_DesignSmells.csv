Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Connect.Sockets,SocketClientManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\Sockets\ClientManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Imperative Abstraction,Connect.Sockets,RawSocketClientManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\Sockets\ClientManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Unnecessary Abstraction,Connect.Sockets,SocketCommandArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\Sockets\SocketCommandArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Ack' Size
Unutilized Abstraction,Connect.Sockets,Utility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\Sockets\Utility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Connect,ConnectArgsExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\ConnectArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Connect.WCF.Channels,SimpleObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\WCF\Channels\NetTcpDC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,Connect.Sockets,SocketClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\Sockets\SocketClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Queued' BytesTransfered' OnSend
Broken Modularization,Connect,ConnectArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\ConnectArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Help' Mode' Server' Port' ConnectionLimit' MessageRate' Scenario' ScenarioArguments' Type
Rebellious Hierarchy,Connect,none,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IoFx_IoFx\src\Tests\Performance\Connect\TestScenario.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Run
