Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.53  All the dependencies among components: from: GreyMagic' to: GreyMagic.Internals' from: GreyMagic' to: GreyMagic.Native' from: GreyMagic.Internals' to: GreyMagic' from: GreyMagic.Native' to: GreyMagic' from: IceFlake.Client.API' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Client.API' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake.Client.API' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Client' to: GreyMagic' from: IceFlake.Client' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Client' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake.Client' to: IceFlake.DirectX' from: IceFlake.Client' to: GreyMagic.Internals' from: IceFlake.Client' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines.Combat' to: IceFlake.Client.Routines' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines.Combat' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines.Combat' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines' to: IceFlake.DirectX' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Client.Routines' to: IceFlake.Runtime' from: IceFlake.Client.Collections' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Client.Collections' to: GreyMagic' from: IceFlake.Client.Collections' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Client.Collections' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake.Client.Collections' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Client.Objects' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake.Client.Objects' to: GreyMagic' from: IceFlake.Client.Objects' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Client.Objects' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Client.Objects' to: IceFlake.DirectX' from: IceFlake.Client.Objects' to: IceFlake.Client.Collections' from: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' to: IceFlake.DirectX' from: IceFlake.Client.Scripts' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Client.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Runtime' from: IceFlake.DirectX' to: GreyMagic.Internals' from: IceFlake.DirectX' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.DirectX' to: GreyMagic' from: IceFlake.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client.Routines.Combat' from: IceFlake.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Routines' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client.Routines' from: IceFlake.Routines' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake.Runtime' to: IceFlake.DirectX' from: IceFlake.Runtime' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Runtime' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake' to: IceFlake.DirectX' from: IceFlake' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake' to: IceFlake.Client.Scripts' from: IceFlake' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake' to: IceFlake.Properties' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Client' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Client.Patchables' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Client.Collections' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Client.Objects' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: GreyMagic' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Client.API' from: IceFlake.Scripts' to: IceFlake.Client.Routines.,IceFlake.Client.Objects.WoWAura' IceFlake.Client.Objects.WoWAura' IceFlake.Client.Objects.WoWAura' IceFlake.Client.Objects.WoWAura' IceFlake.Client.Objects.WoWLocalPlayer' IceFlake.Client.Objects.WoWSpell' IceFlake.Routines.ElementalShamanRoutine' IceFlake.Routines.ElementalShamanRoutine' IceFlake.Routines.ElementalShamanRoutine' IceFlake.Routines.ElementalShamanRoutine' IceFlake.Routines.ElementalShamanRoutine' IceFlake.Routines.ElementalShamanRoutine' IceFlake.Manager' IceFlake.Manager' IceFlake.IceForm' IceFlake.IceForm' IceFlake.IceForm' IceFlake.IceForm' IceFlake.Scripts.ChatScript' IceFlake.Scripts.ChatScript' IceFlake.Scripts.DebugScript' IceFlake.Scripts.DebugScript' IceFlake.Scripts.DebugScript' IceFlake.Scripts.PacketScript' IceFlake.Scripts.FishingBot' IceFlake.Scripts.StarterMageRoutineScript
