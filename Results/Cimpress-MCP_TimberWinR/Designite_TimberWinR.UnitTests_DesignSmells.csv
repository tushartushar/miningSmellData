Feature Envy,TimberWinR.UnitTests.Parser,ElasticsearchOutputTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Cimpress-MCP_TimberWinR\TimberWinR.UnitTests\Parser\ElasticsearchOutputTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Given_no_ssl_then_validate_does_not_throw which is more interested in members of the type: ElasticsearchOutputParameters
