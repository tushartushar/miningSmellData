Imperative Abstraction,FluentHttp,HttpWebResponseWrapper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\Core\HttpWebResponseWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetResponseStream
Duplicate Abstraction,FluentHttp,FluentHttpHeader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpHeaders.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FluentHttpHeader (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpHeaders.cs' [89' 140])' FluentQueryString (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentQueryStrings.cs' [157' 208])
Duplicate Abstraction,FluentHttp,FluentHttpRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FluentHttpRequest (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpRequest.cs' [559' 578])' FluentHttpRequest (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpRequest.cs' [599' 618])' Helpers (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\HttpEncoder.cs' [14' 33])' HttpUtility (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\HttpUtility.cs' [13' 32])
Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentHttp.External,Helpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\HttpEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' InvariantCulture
Deficient Encapsulation,CombinationStream,CombinationStreamAsyncResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\CombinationStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BytesRead
Insufficient Modularization,FluentHttp,FluentHttpRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentHttp,FluentHttpRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\FluentHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentHttp.External,HttpUtility,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\HttpUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentHttp.External,HttpUtility,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\HttpUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentHttp.External,HttpUtility,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\HttpUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 117
Rebellious Hierarchy,CombinationStream,CombinationStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\prabirshrestha_FluentHttp\src\FluentHttp\CombinationStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek' Write
