Unutilized Abstraction,ClangVSx,CommandBar,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CommandBar1.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClangVSx,RegistryBooleanSupport,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClangVSx,CVXRegistryItem,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,CVXRegistry,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PathToClang' ShowCommands' MakeBatchFiles' ShowPhases' VerboseVectorize' COptCPP14' COptSLPAgg' COptStdSpec' COptMaxErrToAbort' CommonArgs' TripleWin32' TripleX64' TripleARM' VSRootPathOverride' VSRootPath
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,CVXRegistry,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PathToClang' ShowCommands' MakeBatchFiles' ShowPhases' VerboseVectorize' COptCPP14' COptSLPAgg' COptStdSpec' COptMaxErrToAbort' CommonArgs' TripleWin32' TripleX64' TripleARM' VSRootPathOverride' VSRootPath
Insufficient Modularization,ClangVSx,CVXBuildSystem,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXBuildSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 234
Broken Modularization,ClangVSx,CVXRegistry,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PathToClang' ShowCommands' MakeBatchFiles' ShowPhases' VerboseVectorize' COptCPP14' COptSLPAgg' COptStdSpec' COptMaxErrToAbort' CommonArgs' TripleWin32' TripleX64' TripleARM' VSRootPathOverride' VSRootPath
Insufficient Modularization,NEnhancer.Common,DTEHelper,F:\newReposMay17\ishani_ClangVSx\DTEHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
