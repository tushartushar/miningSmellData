Unutilized Abstraction,ClangVSx,CommandBar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CommandBar1.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClangVSx,IWinWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXConnect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Handle' mHandle
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClangVSx,ProjectBuildConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXOps.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BuildBegun' BuildFinished' BuildShouldCancel' JustLink
Unutilized Abstraction,ClangVSx,RegistryBooleanSupport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,ProjectFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXBuildSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Config' File
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,IWinWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXConnect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: mHandle
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,ProjectBuildConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXOps.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BuildBegun' BuildFinished' BuildShouldCancel' JustLink
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,CVXRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PathToClang' ShowCommands' MakeBatchFiles' ShowPhases' VerboseVectorize' COptCPP14' COptSLPAgg' COptStdSpec' COptMaxErrToAbort' CommonArgs' TripleWin32' TripleX64' TripleARM' VSRootPathOverride' VSRootPath
Deficient Encapsulation,ClangVSx,CVXRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PathToClang' ShowCommands' MakeBatchFiles' ShowPhases' VerboseVectorize' COptCPP14' COptSLPAgg' COptStdSpec' COptMaxErrToAbort' CommonArgs' TripleWin32' TripleX64' TripleARM' VSRootPathOverride' VSRootPath
Insufficient Modularization,ClangVSx,CVXBuildSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXBuildSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 190
Broken Modularization,ClangVSx,CVXRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\CVXRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PathToClang' ShowCommands' MakeBatchFiles' ShowPhases' VerboseVectorize' COptCPP14' COptSLPAgg' COptStdSpec' COptMaxErrToAbort' CommonArgs' TripleWin32' TripleX64' TripleARM' VSRootPathOverride' VSRootPath
Insufficient Modularization,NEnhancer.Common,DTEHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ishani_ClangVSx\DTEHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
