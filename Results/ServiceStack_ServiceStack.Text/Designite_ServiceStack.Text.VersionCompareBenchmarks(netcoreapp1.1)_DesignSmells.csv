Unnecessary Abstraction,StackExchange.Profiling,ClientTiming,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Text\benchmarks\ServiceStack.Text.VersionCompareBenchmarks\MiniProfiler\ClientTiming.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Start' Duration' Id' MiniProfilerId
Imperative Abstraction,StackExchange.Profiling,ClientTimings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Text\benchmarks\ServiceStack.Text.VersionCompareBenchmarks\MiniProfiler\ClientTimings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FromForm
