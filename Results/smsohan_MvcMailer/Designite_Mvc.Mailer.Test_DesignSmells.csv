Feature Envy,Mvc.Mailer.Test,StringResultTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smsohan_MvcMailer\Mvc.Mailer.Test\StringResultTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExecuteResultWithBlankViewNameShouldThrowArgumentNullException which is more interested in members of the type: StringResult
Feature Envy,Mvc.Mailer.Test,StringResultTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smsohan_MvcMailer\Mvc.Mailer.Test\StringResultTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ShouldRenderViewIntoOutputPropertyWhenViewIsSet which is more interested in members of the type: StringResult
Feature Envy,Mvc.Mailer.Test,StringResultTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smsohan_MvcMailer\Mvc.Mailer.Test\StringResultTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ShouldRenderViewIntoOutputProperty which is more interested in members of the type: StringResult
