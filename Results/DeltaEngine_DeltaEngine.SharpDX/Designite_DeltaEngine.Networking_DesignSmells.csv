Imperative Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Networking.Tcp,DataCollector,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Networking\Tcp\DataCollector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ReadBytes
Multifaceted Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Networking.Tcp,DataCollector,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Networking\Tcp\DataCollector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Multifaceted Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Networking.Tcp,TcpSocket,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Networking\Tcp\TcpSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Deficient Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Networking.Tcp,OnlineServiceConnection,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Networking\Tcp\OnlineServiceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServerErrorHappened' LoggedIn' loadContentMetaData' ContentReady' ContentReceived
Broken Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Networking.Tcp,OnlineServiceConnection,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Networking\Tcp\OnlineServiceConnection.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TcpSocket
