Unnecessary Abstraction,GameOfDeath,Damage,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Damage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Interval' DoDamage
Multifaceted Abstraction,GameOfDeath,RabbitGrid,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\RabbitGrid.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Multifaceted Abstraction,GameOfDeath,UserInterface,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\UserInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Deficient Encapsulation,GameOfDeath.Items,Item,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Items\Item.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DoDamage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameOfDeath,DoDamage,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\DoDamage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DoDamage' ItemEffect
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameOfDeath,UserInterface,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\UserInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UserInterface' Item
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameOfDeath.Items,RotateMallet,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Items\RotateMallet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RotateMallet' Mallet
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath,FadeSprite,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\FadeSprite.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Sprite
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath,Rabbit,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Rabbit.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Sprite
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath,UserInterface,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\UserInterface.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Scene
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath.Items,Atomic,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Items\Atomic.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Item
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath.Items,Toxic,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Items\Toxic.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Item
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath.Items,Fire,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Items\Fire.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Item
Broken Hierarchy,GameOfDeath.Items,Item,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.SharpDX\Samples\GameOfDeath\Items\Item.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Sprite
