Imperative Abstraction,ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial,FeatureClassManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\GeoSpatial\FeatureClassManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Release
Feature Envy,ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial,FeatureClassManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\GeoSpatial\FeatureClassManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetFeatureClassInsideDataset which is more interested in members of the type: SdeServerInfo

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ServicePublisher.MXD,MapService10_1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\MXD\MapService10_1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ServicePublisher.MXD,MapService10_1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\MXD\MapService10_1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MapService10_1 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\MXD\MapService10_1.cs' [25' 48])' MapService (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\MXD\MapService.cs' [18' 41])
Unutilized Abstraction,ServicePublisher,Services,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\Services.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ServicePublisher,Services,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\Services.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Services (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\Services.cs' [55' 76])' Services (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\Services.cs' [96' 117])
Deficient Encapsulation,ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial,FeatureValues,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\GeoSpatial\StoreToFeatureClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Value' Index
Deficient Encapsulation,ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial,FeatureResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\GeoSpatial\StoreToFeatureClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Feature
Deficient Encapsulation,ServicePublisher.MXD,MxdManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\MXD\MxdManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsInitialized
Broken Modularization,ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial,SdeServerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\GeoSpatial\SdeServerInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: server' instance' database' user' password' version' _server' _instance' _database' _user' _password' _version
Broken Hierarchy,ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial,StoreToFeatureClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Esri_arcgis-osm-editor\src\ServicePublisher\GeoSpatial\StoreToFeatureClass.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServicePublisher.GeoSpatial.FeatureClassManager
