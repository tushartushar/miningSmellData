Unnecessary Abstraction,IPAddressControlLib,FieldChangedEventArgs,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\FieldChangedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FieldIndex' Text' _fieldIndex' _text
Unnecessary Abstraction,IPAddressControlLib,TextChangedEventArgs,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\FieldControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FieldIndex' Text' _fieldIndex' _text
Multifaceted Abstraction,IPAddressControlLib,IPAddressControl,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\IPAddressControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Unutilized Abstraction,IPAddressControlLib,IPAddressControl,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\IPAddressControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,IPAddressControlLib,IPAddressControlDesigner,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\IPAddressControlDesigner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SelectionRules' SnapLines
Unutilized Abstraction,IPAddressControlLib,IPAddressControlDesigner,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\IPAddressControlDesigner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,OutStaller,Program,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: WriteLine
Broken Modularization,IPAddressControlLib,CedeFocusEventArgs,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\FieldControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FieldIndex' Action' Direction' Selection' _fieldIndex' _action' _direction' _selection
Insufficient Modularization,IPAddressControlLib,IPAddressControl,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\IPAddressControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,IPAddressControlLib,IPAddressControl,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\IPAddressControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OutStaller,Form1,C:\repos\byteit101_ZomB-Dashboard-System\releasefiles\Installer\outstaller\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Form1' Program
