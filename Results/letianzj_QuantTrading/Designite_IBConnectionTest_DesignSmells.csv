Duplicate Abstraction,IBConnectionTest,ContractOrderDlg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\ContractOrderDlg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ContractOrderDlg (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\ContractOrderDlg.cs' [1' 20])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\Program.cs' [1' 20])
Feature Envy,IBConnectionTest,IBConnectionTestForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\IBConnectionTestForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: btnReqMktDepth_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ContractOrderDlg

Deficient Encapsulation,IBConnectionTest,ContractOrderDlg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\ContractOrderDlg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _contract' _order' label1' tbRequestId' groupBox1' label2' tbExpiry' label5' tbType' label4' tbSymbol' label3' tbContractId' tbSecId' label15' tbSecIdType' label14' tbIncludeExpired' label13' tbLocalSymbol' label12' tbCurrency' label11' tbPrimaryExchange' label10' tbExchange' label9' tbMultiplier' label8' tbRight' label7' tbStrike' label6' groupBox2' tbGenericTickTags' label16' cbSnapshot' groupBox3' tbNumOfRows' label17' groupBox4' tbOverride' label20' tbNumOfContracts' label19' tbAction' label18' btnOK' btnCancel' groupBox5' tbOrderAction' label21' tbGoodTillTime' label27' tbGoodAfterTime' label26' tbAuxPrice' label25' tbOrderPrice' label24' tbOrderType' label23' tbTotalOrderSize' label22' btnFaAlloc' btnComboLegs' btnDeltaNeutral' btnCmbRoutParams' btnAlgoParams' groupBox6' tbRTH' label32' tbWhatToShow' label31' tbBarSize' label30' tbDuration' label29' tbEndDate' label28' tbDateFormat' label33' groupBox7' label34' comboMarketDataType
Insufficient Modularization,IBConnectionTest,IBConnectionTestForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\IBConnectionTestForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,IBConnectionTest,IBConnectionTestForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\IBConnectionTestForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 84 methods
Insufficient Modularization,IBConnectionTest,IBConnectionTestForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\letianzj_QuantTrading\Source\IBConnection\IBConnectionTest\IBConnectionTestForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
