Cyclic Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: RAFTiNG' RAFTiNG.Messages,RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>,RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>
Cyclic Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: RAFTiNG' RAFTiNG.Messages' RAFTiNG.States,RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>' RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>,RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>' RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>
Cyclic Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.Messages,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: RAFTiNG.Messages' RAFTiNG' RAFTiNG.States' RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>' RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>,RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>' RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>
Cyclic Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.Messages,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: RAFTiNG.Messages' RAFTiNG.States' RAFTiNG' RAFTiNG.States' RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>' RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>' RAFTiNG.Node<T>,RAFTiNG.Messages.AppendEntries<T>' RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>' RAFTiNG.Node<T>
Cyclic Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.States,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: RAFTiNG.States' RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>' RAFTiNG.Node<T>,RAFTiNG.States.Candidate<T>' RAFTiNG.Node<T>
Unstable Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): RAFTiNG.States,RAFTiNG.Candidate<T>' RAFTiNG.Follower<T>' RAFTiNG.Leader<T>' RAFTiNG.State<T>,RAFTiNG.Candidate<T>' RAFTiNG.Follower<T>' RAFTiNG.Leader<T>' RAFTiNG.State<T>
Unstable Dependency,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.Messages,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG.Messages.LogEntry<T>,RAFTiNG.Messages.LogEntry<T>
Feature Concentration,RAFTiNG,RAFTiNG,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LogEntry<T>' PersistedState<T>' Node<T>' NodeSettings' NodeStatus]' [LogExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,RAFTiNG.LogExtensions,RAFTiNG.LogEntry<T>' RAFTiNG.LogExtensions' RAFTiNG.Node<T>' RAFTiNG.NodeSettings' RAFTiNG.NodeStatus' RAFTiNG.PersistedState<T>
