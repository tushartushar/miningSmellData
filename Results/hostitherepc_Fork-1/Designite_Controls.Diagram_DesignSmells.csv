Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Controls.Diagram,DiagramLayoutDirection,C:\repos\hostitherepc_Fork-1\CallButler Open Source PBX\Common\Controls.Diagram\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DiagramLayoutDirection[1' 36]' DiagramControl[1' 36]' DiagramShapeControlBase[1' 36]
Duplicate Abstraction,Controls.Diagram,DiagramLayoutDirection,C:\repos\hostitherepc_Fork-1\CallButler Open Source PBX\Common\Controls.Diagram\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DiagramLayoutDirection[1' 34]' Resources[1' 34]' DiagramControl[1' 34]' DiagramShapeControlBase[1' 34]
Duplicate Abstraction,Controls.Diagram,DiagramControl,C:\repos\hostitherepc_Fork-1\CallButler Open Source PBX\Common\Controls.Diagram\DiagramControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Multifaceted Abstraction,Controls.Diagram,DiagramShapeControlBase,C:\repos\hostitherepc_Fork-1\CallButler Open Source PBX\Common\Controls.Diagram\DiagramShapeControlBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Controls.Diagram,DiagramControl,C:\repos\hostitherepc_Fork-1\CallButler Open Source PBX\Common\Controls.Diagram\DiagramControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DiagramControl' DiagramShapeControlBase
