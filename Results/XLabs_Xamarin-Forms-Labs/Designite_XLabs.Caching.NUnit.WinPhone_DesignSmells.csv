(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,XLabs.Caching.SQLiteTests,dataClass,C:\repos\XLabs_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\tests\Caching\XLabs.Caching.NUnit.Shared\BlobSerializerExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
