Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,XLabs.Cryptography,MD5,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XLabs_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MD5 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XLabs_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs' [690' 710])' MD5 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XLabs_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs' [739' 759])
Broken Hierarchy,XLabs.Cryptography,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XLabs_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XLabs.Cryptography.MD5
