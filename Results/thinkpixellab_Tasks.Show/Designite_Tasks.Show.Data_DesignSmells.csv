Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tasks.Show.Helpers,StringHelper,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Helpers\StringHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tasks.Show.Models,DraftTask,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\DraftTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FolderName' m_folderName
Unutilized Abstraction,Tasks.Show.Models,TaskParser,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\TaskParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tasks.Show.Models,BaseFolder,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\Folder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseFolder' Task
Broken Hierarchy,Tasks.Show.Models,DraftTask,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\DraftTask.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTask
Cyclic Hierarchy,Tasks.Show.Models,BaseFolder,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\Folder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SpecialFolder
Cyclic Hierarchy,Tasks.Show.Models,BaseTask,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\BaseTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Task
Broken Hierarchy,Tasks.Show.Models,Task,D:\newReposJune17\thinkpixellab_Tasks.Show\Tasks.Show.Data\Models\Task.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTask
