Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rest4Net,ContainJson,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\ContainJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Json
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rest4Net,IContainJson,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\IContainJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Json
Imperative Abstraction,Rest4Net.CommandUtils,JsonValue2Object,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\CommandUtils\JsonValue2Object.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConvertTo
Imperative Abstraction,Rest4Net.Protocols,CommonWebProtocol,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Protocols\CommonWebProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unutilized Abstraction,Rest4Net.Utils.xBrainLab,HMACMD5,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Utils\xBrainLab\HmacMd5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rest4Net.Utils.xBrainLab,ABCDStruct,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Utils\xBrainLab\Md5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' A' B' C' D
Deficient Encapsulation,Rest4Net.Utils.xBrainLab,ABCDStruct,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Utils\xBrainLab\Md5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: A' B' C' D
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rest4Net,Command,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Command' RestApiProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rest4Net,Command,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Command' BaseProtocol' RestApiProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rest4Net.Protocols,BaseProtocol,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Protocols\BaseProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseProtocol' RestApiProvider' Command' RestApiProvider' Command
Broken Hierarchy,Rest4Net.Protocols,HttpBaseProtocol,C:\repos\acropolium_Rest4Net\src\Rest4Net\Protocols\HttpBaseProtocol.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CommonWebProtocol
