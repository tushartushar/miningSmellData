Unnecessary Abstraction,RimDev.Sandbox,PropertyBag,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ritterim_sandbox\src\Core\Expando.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,RimDev.Sandbox,PropertyBag<TValue>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ritterim_sandbox\src\Core\Expando.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,RimDev.Sandbox,Expando,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ritterim_sandbox\src\Core\Expando.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Properties
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RimDev.Sandbox,IGrain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ritterim_sandbox\src\Core\IGrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RimDev.Sandbox.IGrain' RimDev.Sandbox.Sandbox
Broken Hierarchy,RimDev.Sandbox,Sandbox,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ritterim_sandbox\src\Core\Sandbox.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RimDev.Sandbox.Expando
