Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ENode.EventStorePerfTests,ENodeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\PerformanceTests\ENode.EventStorePerfTests\ENodeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ENode.EventStorePerfTests,TestEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\PerformanceTests\ENode.EventStorePerfTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,ENode.EventStorePerfTests,BatchAppendContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\PerformanceTests\ENode.EventStorePerfTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BatchSize' PrintSize' FinishedCount' EventStore' EventQueue' Watch' EventList
Broken Modularization,ENode.EventStorePerfTests,BatchAppendContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\PerformanceTests\ENode.EventStorePerfTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BatchSize' PrintSize' FinishedCount' EventStore' EventQueue' Watch' EventList
