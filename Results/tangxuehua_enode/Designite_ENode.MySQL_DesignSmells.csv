Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ENode.MySQL,ENodeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\ENodeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ENode.MySQL,MySqlEventStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MySqlEventStore (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlEventStore.cs' [275' 302])' MySqlPublishedVersionStore (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlPublishedVersionStore.cs' [158' 185])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ENode.MySQL,AggregateEventAppendResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' EventAppendStatus' DuplicateCommandIds
Deficient Encapsulation,ENode.MySQL,BatchAggregateEventAppendResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TaskCompletionSource
Deficient Encapsulation,ENode.MySQL,AggregateEventAppendResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EventAppendStatus' DuplicateCommandIds
Broken Modularization,ENode.MySQL,StreamRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tangxuehua_enode\src\ENode.MySQL\MySqlEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AggregateRootTypeName' AggregateRootId' Version' CommandId' CreatedOn' Events
