Imperative Abstraction,IdentityServer3.Core.Services.Contrib.Internals,PirateLocalizationService,C:\repos\nrkno_IdentityServer3.Contrib.Localization\source\IdentityServer3.Localization\Internals\PirateLocalizationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetString
Unutilized Abstraction,IdentityServer3.Core.Services.Contrib.Internals,PirateLocalizationService,C:\repos\nrkno_IdentityServer3.Contrib.Localization\source\IdentityServer3.Localization\Internals\PirateLocalizationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,IdentityServer3.Core.Services.Contrib.Resources,EventResources,C:\repos\nrkno_IdentityServer3.Contrib.Localization\source\IdentityServer3.Localization\Resources\EventResources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResourceManager' _resourceManager
