Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cake.Testing,FakeDirectory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_cake\src\Cake.Testing\FakeDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cake.Testing.FakeDirectory' Cake.Testing.FakeDirectoryContent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cake.Testing,FakeFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_cake\src\Cake.Testing\FakeFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cake.Testing.FakeFile' Cake.Testing.FakeFileStream
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cake.Testing,FakeFileSystemTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_cake\src\Cake.Testing\FakeFileSystemTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cake.Testing.FakeFileSystemTree' Cake.Testing.FakeDirectory
