Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Cake.Testing(net46),Cake.Testing,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Cake.Testing' Cake.Testing.Fixtures,Cake.Testing.ToolFixtureExtensions' Cake.Testing.Fixtures.ToolFixtureProcessRunner<TFixtureResult>,Cake.Testing.ToolFixtureExtensions' Cake.Testing.Fixtures.ToolFixtureProcessRunner<TFixtureResult>
Unstable Dependency,Cake.Testing(net46),Cake.Testing,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Cake.Testing.Fixtures,Cake.Testing.ToolFixtureResult' Cake.Testing.ToolFixture<TToolSettings'TFixtureResult>,Cake.Testing.ToolFixtureResult' Cake.Testing.ToolFixture<TToolSettings'TFixtureResult>
Feature Concentration,Cake.Testing(net46),Cake.Testing,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [FakeDirectoryExtensions' FakeDirectory' FakeDirectoryContent' FakeFile' FakeFileStream' FakeFileSystem' FakeFileSystemTree' FakeFileExtensions' FakeFileSystemExtensions]' [ToolFixtureExtensions]' [FakeConfiguration]' [FakeConsole]' [FakeEnvironment' FakePlatform' FakeRuntime]' [FakeLog' FakeLogMessage]' [FakeProcess]' [MemberTestInfo' MemberTestingUtils]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.4,Cake.Testing.FakeLog' Cake.Testing.FakeLogMessage' Cake.Testing.MemberTestInfo' Cake.Testing.MemberTestingUtils' Cake.Testing.ToolFixtureExtensions' Cake.Testing.FakeConfiguration' Cake.Testing.FakeConsole' Cake.Testing.FakeProcess,Cake.Testing.FakeDirectoryExtensions' Cake.Testing.FakeFileExtensions' Cake.Testing.FakeFileSystemExtensions' Cake.Testing.ToolFixtureExtensions' Cake.Testing.FakeConfiguration' Cake.Testing.FakeConsole' Cake.Testing.FakeDirectory' Cake.Testing.FakeDirectoryContent' Cake.Testing.FakeEnvironment' Cake.Testing.FakeFile' Cake.Testing.FakeFileStream' Cake.Testing.FakeFileSystem' Cake.Testing.FakeFileSystemTree' Cake.Testing.FakeLog' Cake.Testing.FakeLogMessage' Cake.Testing.FakePlatform' Cake.Testing.FakeProcess' Cake.Testing.FakeRuntime' Cake.Testing.MemberTestInfo' Cake.Testing.MemberTestingUtils
