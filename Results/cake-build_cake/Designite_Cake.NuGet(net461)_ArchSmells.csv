Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Cake.NuGet(net461),Cake.NuGet,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Cake.NuGet' Cake.NuGet.Install,Cake.NuGet.NuGetModule' Cake.NuGet.Install.NuGetPackageInstaller,Cake.NuGet.NuGetModule' Cake.NuGet.Install.NuGetPackageInstaller
Unstable Dependency,Cake.NuGet(net461),Cake.NuGet,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Cake.NuGet.Install,Cake.NuGet.NuGetPackageInstaller,Cake.NuGet.NuGetPackageInstaller
Feature Concentration,Cake.NuGet(net461),Cake.NuGet,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Constants' NuGetModule' NuGetPackageInstaller' NuGet' INuGetContentResolver' NuGetContentResolver' INuGetPackageInstaller' NuGetLoadDirectiveProvider]' [Paths]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,Cake.NuGet.Paths,Cake.NuGet.Constants' Cake.NuGet.NuGet' Cake.NuGet.Paths' Cake.NuGet.INuGetContentResolver' Cake.NuGet.INuGetPackageInstaller' Cake.NuGet.NuGetContentResolver' Cake.NuGet.NuGetLoadDirectiveProvider' Cake.NuGet.NuGetModule' Cake.NuGet.NuGetPackageInstaller
Scattered Functionality,Cake.NuGet(net461),Cake.NuGet,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Cake.Core.IO' Cake.Core.Diagnostics,Cake.Core.IO.GlobberExtensions' Cake.Core.IO.FilePath' Cake.Core.IO.FileExtensions' Cake.Core.IO.DirectoryPath' Cake.Core.Diagnostics.LogExtensions' Cake.Core.IO.IFileSystem' Cake.Core.IO.IDirectory' Cake.Core.IO.IProcessRunner' Cake.Core.IO.IProcess,Cake.Core.IO.GlobberExtensions' Cake.Core.IO.FilePath' Cake.Core.IO.FileExtensions' Cake.Core.IO.DirectoryPath' Cake.Core.Diagnostics.LogExtensions' Cake.Core.IO.IFileSystem' Cake.Core.IO.IDirectory' Cake.Core.IO.IProcessRunner' Cake.Core.IO.IProcess
Scattered Functionality,Cake.NuGet(net461),Cake.NuGet.Install,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Cake.Core.Configuration' Cake.Core.IO,Cake.Core.Configuration.ICakeConfiguration' Cake.Core.IO.DirectoryPath' Cake.Core.IO.FilePath,Cake.Core.Configuration.ICakeConfiguration' Cake.Core.IO.DirectoryPath' Cake.Core.IO.FilePath
