Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,GoGo_Tester,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ConnTimeout' MaxThreads' PassCount' Version
Unutilized Abstraction,GoGo_Tester,Exts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\IpPool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GoGo_Tester.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnTimeout' MaxThreads' PassCount' Version
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConnTimeout' MaxThreads' PassCount' Version
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestCaches' ExtraCaches' WaitQueue' ThreadQueue
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TestCaches' ExtraCaches' WaitQueue' ThreadQueue
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Form2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Form2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RandomNumber
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Form2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Form2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RandomNumber
Deficient Encapsulation,GoGo_Tester,Ip,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\IpPool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AddressBytes
Insufficient Modularization,GoGo_Tester,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 68 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GoGo_Tester,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\azzvx_gogotester\GoGo Tester\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 157
