Unnecessary Abstraction,Abot2.Tests.Unit,AssemblyDirectives,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\AssemblyDirectives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Abot2.Tests.Unit,AssemblyDirectives,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\AssemblyDirectives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Abot2,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LogFormatTemplate
Unutilized Abstraction,Abot2,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Abot2.Core,HyperLinkParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Core\HyperLinkParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetLinks
Feature Envy,Abot2.Core,PageRequester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Core\PageRequester.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BuildHttpClient which is more interested in members of the type: CrawlConfiguration
Feature Envy,Abot2.Core,PageRequester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Core\PageRequester.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BuildHttpClientHandler which is more interested in members of the type: CrawlConfiguration
Unnecessary Abstraction,Abot2.Crawler,IPoliteWebCrawler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Crawler\PoliteWebCrawler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,Abot2.Crawler,PoliteWebCrawler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Crawler\PoliteWebCrawler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CrawlAsync
Unnecessary Abstraction,Abot2.Poco,HyperLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Poco\HyperLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HrefValue
Deficient Encapsulation,Abot2,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LogFormatTemplate
Deficient Encapsulation,Abot2,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LogFormatTemplate
Deficient Encapsulation,Abot2.Poco,CrawlContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Poco\CrawlContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CrawledCount
Insufficient Modularization,Abot2.Crawler,WebCrawler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Crawler\WebCrawler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Abot2.Crawler,WebCrawler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Crawler\WebCrawler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Abot2.Poco,CrawledPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Poco\CrawledPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Abot2.Poco.CrawledPage' Abot2.Poco.PageToCrawl
Rebellious Hierarchy,Abot2.Crawler,WebCrawler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Crawler\WebCrawler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CrawlAsync
Cyclic Hierarchy,Abot2.Poco,PageToCrawl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sjdirect_abot\Abot2\Poco\PageToCrawl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CrawledPage
