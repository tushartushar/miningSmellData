Unutilized Abstraction,SDL2_CS_COP,ProcessCalls,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\ProcessCalls.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SDL2_CS_COP,ProcessCall,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\ProcessCalls.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Key' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,SDL2_CS_COP,ProcessCallsEnum,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\ProcessCalls.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _processCalls
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,Entity,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Entity' World
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,Entity,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Entity' ProcessCall' World
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,Entity,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Entity' ICOP_System' ProcessCall' World
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,Entity,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Entity' World' ICOP_System' ProcessCall' World
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,ICOP_System,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\ICOP_System.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ICOP_System' World
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,ICOP_System,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\ICOP_System.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ICOP_System' ProcessCall' World
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDL2_CS_COP,ProcessCall,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\ProcessCalls.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ProcessCall' World
Rebellious Hierarchy,SDL2_CS_COP,Applicator,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\Applicator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Process' CanProcess
Broken Hierarchy,SDL2_CS_COP,World,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\World.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SDL2_CS_Bridge
Broken Hierarchy,SDL2_CS_COP.StandardItems.Components,Sprite,C:\repos\trsoluti_SDL2-CS-COP\SDL2-CS-COP\StandardItems\Components\Sprite.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Area
