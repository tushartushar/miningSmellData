Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WindowsSoundProvider,SoundPlaybackLifetime,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adamabdelhamed_PowerArgs\WindowsSoundProvider\SoundPlaybackLifetime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WindowsSoundProvider.SoundPlaybackLifetime' WindowsSoundProvider.SoundThread
Rebellious Hierarchy,WindowsSoundProvider,SoundProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adamabdelhamed_PowerArgs\WindowsSoundProvider\SoundProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Play' Loop' DisposeManagedResources
Broken Hierarchy,WindowsSoundProvider,SoundThread,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\adamabdelhamed_PowerArgs\WindowsSoundProvider\SoundThread.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PowerArgs.Lifetime
