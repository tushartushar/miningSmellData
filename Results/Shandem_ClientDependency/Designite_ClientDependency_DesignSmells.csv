Unnecessary Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core.Controls,ClientDependencyPathCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shandem_ClientDependency\ClientDependency.Core\Controls\ClientDependencyPathCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,CssFileUrlFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shandem_ClientDependency\ClientDependency.Core\CssFileUrlFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,IClientDependencyPath,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shandem_ClientDependency\ClientDependency.Core\IClientDependencyPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Path' ForceBundle
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,ProviderDependencyList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shandem_ClientDependency\ClientDependency.Core\ProviderDependencyList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,ClientDependency.Core,IClientDependencyFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shandem_ClientDependency\ClientDependency.Core\IClientDependencyFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FilePath' DependencyType' Priority' Group' PathNameAlias' ForceProvider' ForceBundle
Broken Modularization,ClientDependency.Core.Config,ClientDependencySection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shandem_ClientDependency\ClientDependency.Core\Config\ClientDependencySection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
