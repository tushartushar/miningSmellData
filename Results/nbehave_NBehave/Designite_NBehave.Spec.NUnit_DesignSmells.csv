Unutilized Abstraction,NBehave.Spec,ActionSpecification<T>,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\nbehave.spec\ActionSpecification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBehave.Spec,IActionSpecification,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\nbehave.spec\IActionSpecification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NBehave.Spec,SpecBase,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\nbehave.spec\SpecBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: NBehave.Spec.SpecBase' NBehave.Spec.NUnit.SpecBase
Unutilized Abstraction,NBehave.Spec,SpecBase<TContext>,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\nbehave.spec\SpecBase_generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NBehave.Spec,SpecBase<TContext>,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\nbehave.spec\SpecBase_generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: NBehave.Spec.SpecBase<TContext>' NBehave.Spec.NUnit.SpecBase<TContext>
Unutilized Abstraction,NBehave.Spec.NUnit,SpecBase,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\NBehave.Spec.NUnit\SpecBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBehave.Spec.NUnit,Extensions,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\NBehave.Spec.NUnit\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBehave.Spec.NUnit,SpecificationAttribute,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\NBehave.Spec.NUnit\SpecificationAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,NBehave.Spec.NUnit,Extensions,C:\repos\nbehave_NBehave\src\NBehave.Spec.NUnit\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 47 public methods
