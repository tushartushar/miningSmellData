Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ConfigInjector,IConfigurationSetting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\IConfigurationSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SanitizedValue' IsSensitive
Unutilized Abstraction,ConfigInjector.Extensions,CollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\Extensions\CollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ConfigInjector.Extensions,ExceptionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\Extensions\ExceptionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ConfigInjector.Extensions,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\Extensions\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ConfigInjector.Infrastructure.SettingsConventions,SettingKeyConventions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\Infrastructure\SettingsConventions\SettingKeyConventions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BuiltInConventions
Unnecessary Abstraction,ConfigInjector.Infrastructure.SettingsReaders,IEnumeratingSettingsReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\Infrastructure\SettingsReaders\IEnumeratingSettingsReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AllKeys
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ConfigInjector.QuickAndDirty,DefaultSettingsReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\QuickAndDirty\DefaultSettingsReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ConfigInjector.QuickAndDirty.DefaultSettingsReader' ConfigInjector.QuickAndDirty.DefaultStaticSettingReaderStrategy
Rebellious Hierarchy,ConfigInjector.Infrastructure.Logging,NullLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uglybugger_ConfigInjector\src\ConfigInjector\Infrastructure\Logging\NullLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Log' Log
