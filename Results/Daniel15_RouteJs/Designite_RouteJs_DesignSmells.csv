Imperative Abstraction,RouteJs.TinyIoc,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetGenericMethod
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteJs.TinyIoc,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reflection,ReverseTypeExtender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Broken Modularization,RouteJs.TinyIoc,ResolveOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UnregisteredResolutionAction' NamedResolutionFailureAction' Default' FailNameNotFoundOnly' FailUnregisteredAndNameNotFound' FailUnregisteredOnly' _Default' _FailUnregisteredAndNameNotFound' _FailUnregisteredOnly' _FailNameNotFoundOnly' _UnregisteredResolutionAction' _NamedResolutionFailureAction
Insufficient Modularization,RouteJs.TinyIoc,TinyIoCContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 86 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RouteJs.TinyIoc,TinyIoCContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 116 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RouteJs.TinyIoc,TinyIoCContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 190
Rebellious Hierarchy,RouteJs.TinyIoc,DelegateFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Daniel15_RouteJs\src\RouteJs\TinyIoC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
