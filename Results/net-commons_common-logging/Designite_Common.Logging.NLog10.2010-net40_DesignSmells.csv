Unutilized Abstraction,Common.Logging.NLog,CommonLoggingTarget,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\net-commons_common-logging\src\Common.Logging.NLog10\Logging\NLog\CommonLoggingTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Common.Logging.NLog,NLogLogger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\net-commons_common-logging\src\Common.Logging.NLog10\Logging\NLog\NLogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 60 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Common.Logging.NLog,NLogLogger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\net-commons_common-logging\src\Common.Logging.NLog10\Logging\NLog\NLogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 63 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Common.Logging.NLog,NLogLogger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\net-commons_common-logging\src\Common.Logging.NLog10\Logging\NLog\NLogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 131
