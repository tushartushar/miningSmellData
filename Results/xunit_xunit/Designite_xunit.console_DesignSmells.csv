Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Xunit.ConsoleClient,ConsoleRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\ConsoleRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: EntryPoint which is more interested in members of the type: CommandLine
Unutilized Abstraction,Xunit.ConsoleClient,ConsoleLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\Utility\ConsoleLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xunit.ConsoleClient,Transform,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\Utility\Transform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CommandLine' Description' OutputHandler
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xunit,JsonToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\common\Json.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Type' Value' Line' Column
Deficient Encapsulation,Xunit.ConsoleClient,Transform,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\Utility\Transform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CommandLine' Description' OutputHandler
Deficient Encapsulation,Xunit.ConsoleClient,TransformFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\Utility\TransformFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NoErrorColoring
Deficient Encapsulation,Xunit.ConsoleClient,TransformFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\Utility\TransformFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NoErrorColoring
Deficient Encapsulation,Xunit,JsonToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\common\Json.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type' Value' Line' Column
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xunit.ConsoleClient,ConsoleRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xunit_xunit\src\xunit.console\ConsoleRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xunit.ConsoleClient.ConsoleRunner' Xunit.ConsoleClient.Program
