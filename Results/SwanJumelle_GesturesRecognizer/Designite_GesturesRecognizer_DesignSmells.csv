Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Phone.Applications.Common,AccelerometerHelperReadingEventArgs,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\AccelerometerHelper\AccelerometerHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RawAcceleration' OptimalyFilteredAcceleration' LowPassFilteredAcceleration' AverageAcceleration
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.Phone.Applications.Common,AccelerometerHelper,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\AccelerometerHelper\AccelerometerHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Phone.Applications.Common,ApplicationSettingHelper,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\AccelerometerHelper\ApplicationSettingHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,GesturesRecognizer,InitClustering,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\InitClustering.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: init
Unnecessary Abstraction,GesturesRecognizer,LocalizedStrings,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\LocalizedStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LocalizedResources' _localizedResources
Unutilized Abstraction,GesturesRecognizer,LocalizedStrings,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\LocalizedStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,GesturesRecognizer,MainPage,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Unutilized Abstraction,GesturesRecognizer,MainPage,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ShakeGestures,ShakeGestureEventArgs,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\ShakeGestureEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ShakeGestureEventArgs[1' 21]' ShakeGesturesHelper[1' 21]' Simulation[1' 21]' ShakeType[1' 21]
Duplicate Abstraction,ShakeGestures,ShakeGestureEventArgs,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\ShakeGestureEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ShakeGestureEventArgs[1' 24]' ShakeType[1' 24]
Imperative Abstraction,ShakeGestures,ShakeGesturesHelper,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\ShakeGesturesHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Simulate
Multifaceted Abstraction,ShakeGestures,ShakeGesturesHelper,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\ShakeGesturesHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.84
Duplicate Abstraction,ShakeGestures,ShakeGesturesHelper,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\ShakeGesturesHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ShakeGesturesHelper[1' 22]' Simulation[1' 22]
Deficient Encapsulation,ShakeGestures,Simulation,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\Simulation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CallTo
Deficient Encapsulation,ShakeGestures,Simulation,C:\repos\SwanJumelle_GesturesRecognizer\GesturesRecognizer\ShakeGestures\Simulation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CallTo
