Unutilized Abstraction,Hudl.FFprobe,MediaLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\MediaLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.FFprobe.Metadata.Models,ContainerMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Metadata\Models\ContainerMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Format' Streams' Frames
Duplicate Abstraction,Hudl.FFprobe.Serialization.Converters,FrameConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\FrameConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FrameConverter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\FrameConverter.cs' [39' 74])' StreamConverter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\StreamConverter.cs' [44' 79])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.FFprobe.Settings,ShowFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Settings\ShowFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.FFprobe.Settings,ShowFrames,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Settings\ShowFrames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.FFprobe.Settings,ShowStreams,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Settings\ShowStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,Hudl.FFprobe.Metadata.Models,BaseFrameMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Metadata\Models\BaseFrameMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AdditionalData
Deficient Encapsulation,Hudl.FFprobe.Metadata.Models,BaseStreamMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Metadata\Models\BaseStreamMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AdditionalData
Broken Modularization,Hudl.FFprobe.Metadata.Models,FormatMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Metadata\Models\FormatMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FileName' NumberOfStreams' NumberOfPrograms' FormatName' FormatLongName' StartTime' Duration' Size' BitRate' ProbeScore' Tags
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hudl.FFprobe.Command,FFprobeCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Command\FFprobeCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Hudl.FFprobe.Command.FFprobeCommand' Hudl.FFprobe.Command.FFprobeCommandBuilder
Broken Hierarchy,Hudl.FFprobe.Command,FFprobeCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Command\FFprobeCommand.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Hudl.FFmpeg.Command.Models.FFCommandBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,Hudl.FFprobe.Serialization.Converters,FractionConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\FractionConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteJson
Rebellious Hierarchy,Hudl.FFprobe.Serialization.Converters,FrameConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\FrameConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create' WriteJson
Rebellious Hierarchy,Hudl.FFprobe.Serialization.Converters,RatioConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\RatioConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteJson
Rebellious Hierarchy,Hudl.FFprobe.Serialization.Converters,StreamConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\StreamConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create' WriteJson
Rebellious Hierarchy,Hudl.FFprobe.Serialization.Converters,TimeSpanConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_HudlFfmpeg\Hudl.FFprobe\Serialization\Converters\TimeSpanConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteJson
