Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Rules,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Rules' ManagedFusion.Rewriter
Unstable Dependency,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Rules' ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Engines' ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Configuration
God Component,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 30
Feature Concentration,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Conditions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DefaultConditionTestValue]' [LexicographicallyFollowsCondition' ConditionFlagsProcessor' LexicographicallyEqualCondition' LexicographicallyPrecedesCondition]' [ConditionFlagProcessor]' [IsFileWithSizeCondition]' [IsDirectoryCondition]' [IsFileCondition]' [DefaultCondition]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.7
Feature Concentration,ManagedFusion.Rewriter,ManagedFusion.Rewriter.Engines,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
