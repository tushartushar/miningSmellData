Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RDotNet,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\Helper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RDotNet,RDotNetTestFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RDotNetTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RDotNet,RuntimeDiagnostics,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RuntimeDiagnostics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,RDotNet,RuntimeDiagnostics,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RuntimeDiagnostics.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateNumericVectors which is more interested in members of the type: REngine
Deficient Encapsulation,RDotNet,Measurement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RuntimeDiagnostics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Operation' Type' N' Duration' What' Tag
Insufficient Modularization,RDotNet,MockDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\MockDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RDotNet,RuntimeDiagnostics,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RuntimeDiagnostics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RDotNet,RuntimeDiagnostics,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RuntimeDiagnostics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Broken Modularization,RDotNet,Measurement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RuntimeDiagnostics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Operation' Type' N' Duration' What' Tag
Rebellious Hierarchy,RDotNet,MockDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\MockDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Busy' Callback' Suicide' FlushConsole' ClearErrorConsole' ShowFiles' ChooseFile' EditFile' LoadHistory' SaveHistory' AddHistory
Wide Hierarchy,RDotNet,RDotNetTestFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmp75_rdotnet\RDotNet.TestBase\RDotNetTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: RDotNet.CharacterVectorTest' RDotNet.DataConversionTest' RDotNet.DataFrameRowMappingTest' RDotNet.DataFrameTest' RDotNet.EnvironmentTest' RDotNet.ExceptionHandlingTest' RDotNet.FactorTest' RDotNet.InternalStringTest' RDotNet.ListsTest' RDotNet.MultiThreadingTest' RDotNet.PerformanceTest' RDotNet.REngineCleanupTest' RDotNet.REngineTest' RDotNet.RFunctionsTest' RDotNet.S4ClassesTest
