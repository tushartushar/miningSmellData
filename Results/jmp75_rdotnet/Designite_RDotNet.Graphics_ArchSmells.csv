Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,RDotNet.Graphics,RDotNet.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: RDotNet.Graphics' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals,RDotNet.Graphics.DeviceDescription' RDotNet.Graphics.GraphicsDeviceAdapter' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.GEcontext
Unstable Dependency,RDotNet.Graphics,RDotNet.Graphics.Internals,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): RDotNet.Graphics,RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.Color' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.LineType' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.LineEnd' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.LineJoin' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.FontFace' RDotNet.Graphics.Internals.Adjustment
Feature Concentration,RDotNet.Graphics,RDotNet.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Color' DeviceDescription' LineType' Adjustment' IGraphicsDevice' GraphicsDeviceEventArgs' GraphicsDeviceAdapter' Raster' MetricsInfo' Point' RasterExtension' Rectangle' REngineExtension' Size' Utility' Colors' GraphicsContext]' [LineEnd]' [LineJoin]' [Unit]' [FontFace]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.24,RDotNet.Graphics.Unit' RDotNet.Graphics.FontFace
