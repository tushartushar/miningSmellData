Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CrossroadsIO,SendReceiveExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\SendReceiveExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,CrossroadsIO.Interop,UnmanagedLibrary,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Interop\UnmanagedLibrary.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Dispose which is more interested in members of the type: SafeLibraryHandle
Deficient Encapsulation,CrossroadsIO.Interop,PollItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Interop\PollItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Socket' FileDescriptor' Events' ReadyEvents
Insufficient Modularization,CrossroadsIO,SendReceiveExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\SendReceiveExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,CrossroadsIO,Socket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Socket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,CrossroadsIO.Interop,LibXs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Interop\LibXs.Mono.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Modularization,CrossroadsIO.Interop,Errno,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Interop\Platform.Mono.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' EPERM' ENOENT' ESRCH' EINTR' EIO' ENXIO' E2BIG' ENOEXEC' EBADF' ECHILD' EAGAIN' ENOMEM' EACCES' EFAULT' EBUSY' EEXIST' EXDEV' ENODEV' ENOTDIR' EISDIR' EINVAL' ENFILE' EMFILE' ENOTTY' EFBIG' ENOSPC' ESPIPE' EROFS' EMLINK' EPIPE' EDOM' EDEADLK' ENAMETOOLONG' ENOLCK' ENOSYS' ENOTEMPTY' EADDRINUSE' EADDRNOTAVAIL' ECONNREFUSED' EINPROGRESS' ENETDOWN' ENOBUFS' ENOTSOCK' ENOTSUP' EPROTONOSUPPORT
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossroadsIO,DuplexSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\DuplexSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Subscribe' Unsubscribe
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossroadsIO,ReceiveSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\ReceiveSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Send' Subscribe' Unsubscribe
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossroadsIO,SendSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\SendSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Subscribe' Unsubscribe' Receive' Receive
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossroadsIO,SubscribeSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\SubscribeSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Send
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossroadsIO.Devices,ForwarderDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Devices\ForwarderDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BackendHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,CrossroadsIO.Devices,StreamerDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jgoz_crossroads-net\src\Core\Devices\StreamerDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BackendHandler
