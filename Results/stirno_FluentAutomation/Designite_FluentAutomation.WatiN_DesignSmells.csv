Unutilized Abstraction,FluentAutomation,WatiN,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stirno_FluentAutomation\FluentAutomation.WatiN\WatiN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,FluentAutomation,WatiN,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stirno_FluentAutomation\FluentAutomation.WatiN\WatiN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SelectedBrowser
Deficient Encapsulation,FluentAutomation,WatiN,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stirno_FluentAutomation\FluentAutomation.WatiN\WatiN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SelectedBrowser
Insufficient Modularization,FluentAutomation,CommandProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stirno_FluentAutomation\FluentAutomation.WatiN\CommandProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentAutomation,CommandProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stirno_FluentAutomation\FluentAutomation.WatiN\CommandProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
