Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,MySqlTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\MySqlTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Ivony.Data.Test,MySqlTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\MySqlTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TransactionTest which is more interested in members of the type: MySqlDbExecutor
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,ParameterizedQueryTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\ParameterizedQueryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,PostgreSqlTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\PostgreSqlTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,SQLiteTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\SQLiteTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,SqlServerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\SqlServerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Ivony.Data.Test,SqlServerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\SqlServerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TransactionTest which is more interested in members of the type: SqlDbExecutor
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,WrongEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\SqlServerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Content' Index
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ivony.Data.Test,CorrectEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_DbUtility\Sources\Ivony.Data.Test\SqlServerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
