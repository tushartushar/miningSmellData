Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.CLEye,CapturePropertyNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\CLEye\CLEye\CaptureProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.CLEye,ListDevicesNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\CLEye\CLEye\ListDevicesNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.CLEye,VideoInInstance,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\CLEye\CLEye\VideoInNode.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetAlphaChannel which is more interested in members of the type: CVImageOutput
Unutilized Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.CLEye,VideoInNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\CLEye\CLEye\VideoInNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.CLEye,ManageDependencies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\CLEye\ManageDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,CLEyeMulticam,CLEyeCameraDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\CLEye\CLEye\CLEyeMulticam.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
