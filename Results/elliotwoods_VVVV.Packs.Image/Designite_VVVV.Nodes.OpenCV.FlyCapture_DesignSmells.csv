Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.FlyCapture,Context,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Bus' FBus
Feature Envy,VVVV.Nodes.FlyCapture,CaptureInstance,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\CaptureNode.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CaptureCallback which is more interested in members of the type: CVImageOutput
Unutilized Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.FlyCapture,CaptureNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\CaptureNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.FlyCapture,InfoNodeBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\InfoNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  InfoNodeBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\InfoNode.cs' [1' 23])' CameraListNode (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\ListCameraNode.cs' [1' 23])
Unutilized Abstraction,VVVV.Nodes.FlyCapture,CameraListNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\ListCameraNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,VVVV.Nodes.FlyCapture,CaptureInstance,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\elliotwoods_VVVV.Packs.Image\src\nodes\plugins\Image\FlyCapture\FlyCapture\CaptureNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Allocate
