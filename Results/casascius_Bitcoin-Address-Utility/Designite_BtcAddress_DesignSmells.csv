Broken Hierarchy,Casascius.Bitcoin,PassphraseKeyPair,C:\repos\casascius_Bitcoin-Address-Utility\Model\PassphraseKeyPair.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Casascius.Bitcoin.EncryptedKeyPair
Rebellious Hierarchy,CryptSharp.Utility,Pbkdf2,C:\repos\casascius_Bitcoin-Address-Utility\CryptSharp\Pbkdf2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' SetLength' Write
Missing Hierarchy,BtcAddress.Forms,DecryptKey,C:\repos\casascius_Bitcoin-Address-Utility\Forms\DecryptKey.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: PassphraseKeyPair' KeyPair (in method "btnDecrypt_Click" of class "DecryptKey").
