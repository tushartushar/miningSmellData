Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Parameter
Unutilized Abstraction,ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation.ViewModel,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\saramgsilva_ModernUISamples\src\ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation (NavigationService - MVVM)\ViewModel\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\saramgsilva_ModernUISamples\src\ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation (NavigationService - MVVM)\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\saramgsilva_ModernUISamples\src\ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation (NavigationService - MVVM)\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation.App' ModernUIForWPFSample.DefaultModernUI.App
Unutilized Abstraction,ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\saramgsilva_ModernUISamples\src\ModernUIForWPFSample.Navigation (NavigationService - MVVM)\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
