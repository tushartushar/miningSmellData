List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SQLiteDBHelper[152' 180]' SQLiteDBHelper[194' 222]
Deficient Encapsulation,DAL,DbHelperSQL,C:\repos\algz_WeightCenterDesignAndEstimate\DAL\DbHelperSQL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: connectionString
Deficient Encapsulation,DAL,DbHelperSQL,C:\repos\algz_WeightCenterDesignAndEstimate\DAL\DbHelperSQL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: connectionString
Insufficient Modularization,DAL,DbHelperSQL,C:\repos\algz_WeightCenterDesignAndEstimate\DAL\DbHelperSQL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DAL,DbHelperSQL,C:\repos\algz_WeightCenterDesignAndEstimate\DAL\DbHelperSQL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DAL,DbHelperSQL,C:\repos\algz_WeightCenterDesignAndEstimate\DAL\DbHelperSQL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
