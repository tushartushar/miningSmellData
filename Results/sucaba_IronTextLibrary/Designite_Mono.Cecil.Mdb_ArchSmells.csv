Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Mono.Cecil,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.ModuleDefinition
God Component,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 31,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.ISourceFile' Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.ICompileUnit
Feature Concentration,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MdbReaderProvider' MdbReader]' [MdbWriterProvider' MdbWriter' SourceFile' SourceMethodSymbol' SourceMethod]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29,Mono.Cecil.Mdb.MdbReaderProvider' Mono.Cecil.Mdb.MdbReader
Scattered Functionality,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,Mono.Cecil.Mdb,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter' Mono.Cecil,Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.MonoSymbolFile' Mono.Cecil.MetadataToken
