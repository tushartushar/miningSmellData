Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,CecilRocksAddin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\Addin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,CecilRocksAddin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\Addin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,SecurityDeclarationRocksTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\SecurityDeclarationRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SecurityDeclarationRocksTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\SecurityDeclarationRocksTests.cs' [14' 34])' SecurityDeclarationRocksTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\SecurityDeclarationRocksTests.cs' [37' 57])
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,TypeDefinitionRocksTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\TypeDefinitionRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,TypeReferenceRocksTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\TypeReferenceRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,OptionalModifier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\TypeReferenceRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,RequiredModifier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\TypeReferenceRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,RequiredModifier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\TypeReferenceRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Cecil.Tests,Foo<T1;T2>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\TypeReferenceRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Hierarchy,Mono.Cecil.Tests,CecilRocksAddin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\Addin.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mono.Cecil.Tests.CecilTestAddin
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mono.Cecil.Tests,Bar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\MethodDefinitionRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoFoo
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mono.Cecil.Tests,Baz,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sucaba_IronTextLibrary\Deps\cecil\rocks\Test\Mono.Cecil.Tests\MethodDefinitionRocksTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoFoo
