Unutilized Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data,CountingKsRepository,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\CountingKsRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data,CountingKsSeeder,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\CountingKsSeeder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Seed
Unutilized Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data,Extensions,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data,ICountingKsRepository,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\ICountingKsRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data.Entities,ApiUser,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\Entities\ApiUser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Secret' AppId
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data.Entities,AuthToken,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\Entities\AuthToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Token' Expiration' ApiUser
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebAPIDemo.Data.Entities,DiaryEntry,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\Entities\DiaryEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' FoodItem' Measure' Quantity' Diary
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebAPIDemo.Data,CountingKsContext,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\CountingKsContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CountingKsContext' CountingKsMigrationConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebAPIDemo.Data,CountingKsContext,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\CountingKsContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CountingKsContext' CountingKsSeeder' CountingKsMigrationConfiguration
Insufficient Modularization,WebAPIDemo.Data,CountingKsRepository,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\CountingKsRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebAPIDemo.Data,CountingKsSeeder,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\CountingKsSeeder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CountingKsSeeder' CountingKsMigrationConfiguration' CountingKsContext' CountingKsMigrationConfiguration' CountingKsContext
Broken Modularization,WebAPIDemo.Data.Entities,DiaryEntry,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\Entities\DiaryEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' FoodItem' Measure' Quantity' Diary
Broken Modularization,WebAPIDemo.Data.Entities,Measure,C:\repos\Freeflyjunkie_WebAPIDemo\WebAPIDemo.Data\Entities\Measure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Description' Calories' TotalFat' SaturatedFat' Protein' Carbohydrates' Fiber' Sugar' Sodium' Iron' Cholestrol' Food
