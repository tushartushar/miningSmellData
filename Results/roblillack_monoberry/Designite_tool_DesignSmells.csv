Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MonoBerry.Tool,Device,C:\repos\roblillack_monoberry\tooling\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' IP' Password' PIN' Architecture
Imperative Abstraction,MonoBerry.Tool,Shell,C:\repos\roblillack_monoberry\tooling\Shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Deficient Encapsulation,MonoBerry.Tool,Device,C:\repos\roblillack_monoberry\tooling\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' IP' Password' PIN' Architecture
Broken Modularization,MonoBerry.Tool,Device,C:\repos\roblillack_monoberry\tooling\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' IP' Password' PIN' Architecture
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoBerry.Tool,Configuration,C:\repos\roblillack_monoberry\tooling\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
