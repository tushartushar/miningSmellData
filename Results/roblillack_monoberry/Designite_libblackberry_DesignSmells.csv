Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,BlackBerry,Camera,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\Camera.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BlackBerry,Navigator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\Navigator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BlackBerry,EventType,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\Navigator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: BlackBerry.EventType' BlackBerry.Screen.EventType
Unutilized Abstraction,BlackBerry,Vibration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\NotificationLight.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BlackBerry,NotificationLight,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\Vibration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BlackBerry,SoundPlayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\SoundPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BlackBerry.Screen,PixelFormatExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\screen\PixelFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BlackBerry.Screen,KeyCodeConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\screen\KeyCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UNICODE_PRIVATE_USE_AREA_FIRST' KEYCODE_PC_KEYS' KEYCODE_CONSUMER_KEYS
Deficient Encapsulation,BlackBerry,Navigator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\Navigator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OnExit' OnSwipeDown' OnInvokeResult
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BlackBerry,Button,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\dialog\Button.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BlackBerry.Button' BlackBerry.Dialog
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BlackBerry.Screen,Context,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\screen\Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BlackBerry.Screen.Context' BlackBerry.Screen.Window
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BlackBerry.Screen,Buffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\screen\Buffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BlackBerry.Screen.Buffer' BlackBerry.Screen.Window
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BlackBerry.Screen,Context,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\roblillack_monoberry\libblackberry\screen\Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BlackBerry.Screen.Context' BlackBerry.Screen.Buffer' BlackBerry.Screen.Window
