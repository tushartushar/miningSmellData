Unutilized Abstraction,Monads.Net.Tests,MaybeTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phlik_Monads.net\Monads.Net.Tests\MaybeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Monads.Net.Tests,TestableDummy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phlik_Monads.net\Monads.Net.Tests\MaybeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DummyString' DummyValueType' DummyDictionary
Insufficient Modularization,Monads.Net.Tests,MaybeTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phlik_Monads.net\Monads.Net.Tests\MaybeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
