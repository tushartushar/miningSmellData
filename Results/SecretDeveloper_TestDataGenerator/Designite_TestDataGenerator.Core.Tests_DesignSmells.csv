Unutilized Abstraction,TestDataGenerator.Tests,TextTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\TextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestDataGenerator.Tests,BenchmarkInit,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\Benchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TestDataGenerator.Tests,TDGBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\Benchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _GenerationConfig
Insufficient Modularization,TestDataGenerator.Tests,TextTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\TextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 126 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TestDataGenerator.Tests,TextTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\TextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 126 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TestDataGenerator.Tests,TextTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\TextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 158
Insufficient Modularization,TestDataGenerator.Tests,TDGBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecretDeveloper_TestDataGenerator\src\TestDataGenerator.Core.Tests\Benchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
