Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Mina.Example.SumUp.Codec,AddMessageEncoder<T>,C:\repos\longshine_Mina.NET\Mina.Example\SumUp\Codec\AddMessageEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mina.Example.SumUp.Codec,ResultMessageEncoder<T>,C:\repos\longshine_Mina.NET\Mina.Example\SumUp\Codec\ResultMessageEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mina.Example.SumUp.Message,AbstractMessage,C:\repos\longshine_Mina.NET\Mina.Example\SumUp\Message\AbstractMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Sequence
Broken Modularization,Mina.Example.SumUp.Codec,Constants,C:\repos\longshine_Mina.NET\Mina.Example\SumUp\Codec\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TYPE_LEN' SEQUENCE_LEN' HEADER_LEN' BODY_LEN' RESULT' ADD' RESULT_CODE_LEN' RESULT_VALUE_LEN' ADD_BODY_LEN' RESULT_OK' RESULT_ERROR
Broken Hierarchy,Mina.Example.SumUp.Codec,SumUpProtocolCodecFactory,C:\repos\longshine_Mina.NET\Mina.Example\SumUp\Codec\SumUpProtocolCodecFactory.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mina.Filter.Codec.Demux.DemuxingProtocolCodecFactory
