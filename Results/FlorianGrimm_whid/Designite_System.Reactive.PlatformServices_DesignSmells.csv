Duplicate Abstraction,System.Reactive.Concurrency,ConcurrencyAbstractionLayerImpl,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Source\System.Reactive.PlatformServices\Reactive\Concurrency\ConcurrencyAbstractionLayerImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ConcurrencyAbstractionLayerImpl[261' 280]' ThreadPoolScheduler[294' 313]' ConcurrencyAbstractionLayerImpl[292' 311]' ThreadPoolScheduler[325' 344]
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Reactive.Concurrency,TimerStubs,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Source\System.Reactive.PlatformServices\Reactive\Internal\Stubs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Never
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reactive.Concurrency,TimerStubs,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Source\System.Reactive.PlatformServices\Reactive\Internal\Stubs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reactive.PlatformServices,EnlightenmentProvider,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Source\System.Reactive.PlatformServices\Reactive\EnlightenmentProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reactive,Strings_PlatformServices,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Source\System.Reactive.PlatformServices\Strings_PlatformServices.Generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Missing Hierarchy,System.Reactive.PlatformServices,CurrentPlatformEnlightenmentProvider,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Source\System.Reactive.PlatformServices\Reactive\Internal\PlatformEnlightenmentProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IConcurrencyAbstractionLayer' IScheduler (in method "GetService" of class "CurrentPlatformEnlightenmentProvider").
