Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci,ILRewriter,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILRewriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Rewrite
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci,ILRewriter,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILRewriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci,ILRewriter,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILRewriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ILRewriter[171' 198]' ILRewriter[313' 340]
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 197
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILRewriter,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILRewriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.ILGeneratorImplementation,SynchronizationInformation,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AsyncMethod' MoveNextMethod' GeneratedCatchHandlerOffset' SynchronizationPoints' asyncMethod' moveNextMethod' generatedCatchHandlerOffset' synchronizationPoints
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.ILGeneratorImplementation,SynchronizationPoint,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SynchronizeOffset' ContinuationMethod' ContinuationOffset' startOfSynchronize' startOfContinuation' continuationMethod
