Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,HelloContracts,Options,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\cciast\Samples\HelloContracts\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' assembly' printContracts' inherited' inject' libpaths
Deficient Encapsulation,HelloContracts,Options,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\cciast\Samples\HelloContracts\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: assembly' printContracts' inherited' inject' libpaths
Broken Modularization,HelloContracts,Options,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\cciast\Samples\HelloContracts\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' assembly' printContracts' inherited' inject' libpaths
Broken Hierarchy,HelloContracts,Options,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\cciast\Samples\HelloContracts\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OptionParsing
