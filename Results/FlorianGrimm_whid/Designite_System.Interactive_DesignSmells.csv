Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Linq,IBuffer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Ix\NET\Source\System.Interactive\EnumerableEx.Buffering.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Linq,IBuffer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Ix\NET\Source\System.Interactive\EnumerableEx.Buffering.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Linq,IBuffer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Ix\NET\Source\System.Interactive\EnumerableEx.Buffering.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IBuffer[207' 296]' IBuffer[423' 512]
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Linq,IRefCountList,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Ix\NET\Source\System.Interactive\EnumerableEx.Buffering.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Linq,MaxRefCountList,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Ix\NET\Source\System.Interactive\EnumerableEx.Buffering.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
