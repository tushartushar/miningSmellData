Unnecessary Abstraction,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapChannel,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapChannel,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapClient,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Insufficient Modularization,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapClient,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 50 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapClient,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 77 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapClient,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 113
