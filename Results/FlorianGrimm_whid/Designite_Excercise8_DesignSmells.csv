Unutilized Abstraction,Excercise8.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoap,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise8\Start\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Excercise8.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapChannel,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\rx\Rx\NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise8\Start\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
