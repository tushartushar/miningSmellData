Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci.ReflectionEmitter,DynamicLoader,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ReflectionEmitter\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci.ReflectionEmitter,DynamicLoader,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ReflectionEmitter\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DynamicLoader[975' 1002]' DynamicLoader[1209' 1236]
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci.ReflectionEmitter,ReflectionMapper,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ReflectionEmitter\Mapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.ReflectionEmitter,ReflectionMapper,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ReflectionEmitter\Mapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReflectionMapper' MappingVisitorForTypes
