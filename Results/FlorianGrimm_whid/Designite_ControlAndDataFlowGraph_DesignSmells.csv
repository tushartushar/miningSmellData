Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,DataFlowInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\DataFlowInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,Instruction,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\Graph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString

Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,BasicBlock,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\Graph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OperandStack' Instructions
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,Instruction,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\Graph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Operand1' Operand2
Unexloited Encapsulation,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,TypeInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\TypeInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IGenericParameterReference' IMethodReference' IFieldReference (in method "InferTypeAndUpdateStack" of class "TypeInferencer").
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,ControlFlowInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\ControlFlowInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 125
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,ControlFlowInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\ControlFlowInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ControlFlowInferencer' ControlAndDataFlowGraph
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,ControlFlowInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\ControlFlowInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ControlFlowInferencer' ControlAndDataFlowGraph' DataFlowInferencer' ControlAndDataFlowGraph
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,EnhancedBasicBlock,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\ControlFlowQueries.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' firstDominanceFrontierNode' dominanceFrontierCount' firstPredecessorEdge' predeccessorCount' immediateDominator' postOrderNumber
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,DataFlowInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\DataFlowInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 326
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci.Analysis,DataFlowInferencer,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\other\ccimetadata\Sources\ControlAndDataFlowGraph\DataFlowInferencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataFlowInferencer' ControlAndDataFlowGraph
