Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,CCIHost,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\CCIHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Imperative Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,DependencyInjectionLet,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\DependencyInjectionLet.Generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: TransformText
Multifaceted Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,DependencyInjectionLetBase,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\DependencyInjectionLet.Generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Imperative Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,GenerateDependencyInjectionLet,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\GenerateDependencyInjectionLet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,Import,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\Model\Import.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AllowDefault' Contract
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,PropertyImport,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\Model\PropertyImport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,ToCacheExtension,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\Model\ToCache.Extension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build,Program,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.DependencyInjection.Build.Persitence,ImportCache,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\Persitence\ImportCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AllowDefault' Contract
Deficient Encapsulation,System.DependencyInjection.Build,CCIHost,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\CCIHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CacheRoot
Deficient Encapsulation,System.DependencyInjection.Build,GenerateDependencyInjectionLet,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\GenerateDependencyInjectionLet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CciHost
Broken Hierarchy,System.DependencyInjection.Build,DependencyInjectionLet,C:\repos\FlorianGrimm_whid\src\whid\System.DependencyInjection.Build\DependencyInjectionLet.Generated.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DependencyInjectionLetBase
