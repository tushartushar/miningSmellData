Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Ivony.Logs,LogFilenameStrategy,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LogFilenameStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetName
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Logs,LoggerWrapperExtensions,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LoggerWrapperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Logs,LogMetaExtensions,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LogMetaExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Logs,LogExtensions,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LogExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Ivony.Logs,TextLogger,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\TextLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LogEntry
Deficient Encapsulation,Ivony.Logs,BlankLogger,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\BlankLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,Ivony.Logs,BlankLogger,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\BlankLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Instance
Broken Modularization,Ivony.Logs,LogFileCycles,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LogFileCycles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Daily' Hourly' Minutely' Monthly' _daily' _hourly' _minutely' _monthly
Cyclic Hierarchy,Ivony.Logs,LogFilter,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LogFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: LogSourceNameRestrictFilter
Broken Hierarchy,Ivony.Logs,BuiltInLogType,C:\repos\Ivony_LogUtility\Ivony.Logs\LogType.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ivony.Logs.LogType
