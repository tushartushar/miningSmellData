Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,OpenStack.IntegrationTests,OpenStack.Compute.v2_1,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ComputeServiceTests]' [ComputeTestDataManager' FlavorTests' VolumeTests' ImageTests' ServerGroupTests' SecurityGroupTests' KeyPairTests' ServerTests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ComputeServiceTests,OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ComputeServiceTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ComputeTestDataManager' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.FlavorTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.VolumeTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ImageTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ServerGroupTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.SecurityGroupTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.KeyPairTests' OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ServerTests
Scattered Functionality,OpenStack.IntegrationTests,OpenStack.Compute.v2_1,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: OpenStack.Compute.v2_1' OpenStack,OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ComputeService' OpenStack.IPage,OpenStack.Compute.v2_1.ComputeService' OpenStack.IPage
