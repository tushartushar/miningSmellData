Unutilized Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,Adapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\Adapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,CollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\CollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,ImmutableDeque,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\ImmutableDeque.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,IRecursiveType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\IRecursiveCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Identity
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,IRecursiveParentWithLookupTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\IRecursiveCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InefficiencyLoad' Children' LookupTable
Unutilized Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,RecursiveTypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\RecursiveTypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,LookupTable<TRecursiveType;TRecursiveParent>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\RecursiveTypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph,InitializeLookupResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\RecursiveTypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InefficiencyLoad' LookupTable
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImmutableObjectGraph.Adapters,IImmutableCollectionAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\Adapters\IImmutableCollectionAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UnderlyingCollection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImmutableObjectGraph,IRecursiveParent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AArnott_ImmutableObjectGraph\src\ImmutableObjectGraph\IRecursiveCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImmutableObjectGraph.IRecursiveParent' ImmutableObjectGraph.ParentedRecursiveType
