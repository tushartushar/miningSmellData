Unutilized Abstraction,SatelliteAssemblyTest,TestRes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SeriousM_WPFLocalizationExtension\tests\SatelliteAssemblyTest\TestRes.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SatelliteAssemblyTest,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SeriousM_WPFLocalizationExtension\tests\SatelliteAssemblyTest\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,SatelliteAssemblyTest,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SeriousM_WPFLocalizationExtension\tests\SatelliteAssemblyTest\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SatelliteAssemblyTest.App' WPFLocalizeExtension___Satellite_Assembly_Test.App
