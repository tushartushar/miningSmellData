Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp,CSharpGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp\CSharpGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateTypes
Unutilized Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp,CSharpGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp\CSharpGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.Models,DateFormatConverterTemplateModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp\Models\DateFormatConverterTemplateModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.Models,FileTemplateModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp\Models\FileTemplateModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Namespace' TypesCode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp,CSharpGeneratorSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp\CSharpGeneratorSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.CSharpGeneratorSettings' NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.CSharpValueGenerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.Models,ClassTemplateModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp\Models\ClassTemplateModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.Models.ClassTemplateModel' NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CSharp.Models.PropertyModel
