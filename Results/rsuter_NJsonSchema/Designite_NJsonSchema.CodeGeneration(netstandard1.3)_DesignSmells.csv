Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,CodeArtifactExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\CodeArtifactExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,DefaultTemplateFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\DefaultTemplateFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateTemplate
Unutilized Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,GeneratorBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\GeneratorBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,JsonSchemaGraphUtilities,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\JsonSchemaGraphUtilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.Models,EnumerationItemModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\Models\EnumerationItemModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Value' InternalValue' InternalFlagValue
Unutilized Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.Models,EnumerationItemModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\Models\EnumerationItemModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.Models,TemplateModelBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\Models\TemplateModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ToolchainVersion
Deficient Encapsulation,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,TemplateTag,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\DefaultTemplateFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LanguageKey' TemplateKey' SettingsKey
Deficient Encapsulation,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,TemplateTag,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\DefaultTemplateFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LanguageKey' TemplateKey' SettingsKey
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,CodeGeneratorSettingsBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\CodeGeneratorSettingsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CodeGeneratorSettingsBase' NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.ValueGeneratorBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration,CodeGeneratorSettingsBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rsuter_NJsonSchema\src\NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration\CodeGeneratorSettingsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.CodeGeneratorSettingsBase' NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.TypeResolverBase' NJsonSchema.CodeGeneration.ValueGeneratorBase
