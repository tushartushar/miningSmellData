Unutilized Abstraction,NPOI.HSSF.Converter,ExcelToHtmlConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\svn2github_npoi\scratchpad\HSSF\Converter\ExcelToHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NPOI.HSSF.Converter,ExcelToHtmlConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\svn2github_npoi\scratchpad\HSSF\Converter\ExcelToHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProcessSheetHeader which is more interested in members of the type: HtmlDocumentFacade
Feature Envy,NPOI.HSSF.Converter,ExcelToHtmlConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\svn2github_npoi\scratchpad\HSSF\Converter\ExcelToHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProcessDocumentInformation which is more interested in members of the type: HtmlDocumentFacade
Feature Envy,NPOI.HSSF.Converter,ExcelToHtmlConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\svn2github_npoi\scratchpad\HSSF\Converter\ExcelToHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProcessColumnHeaders which is more interested in members of the type: HtmlDocumentFacade
Feature Envy,NPOI.HSSF.Converter,ExcelToHtmlConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\svn2github_npoi\scratchpad\HSSF\Converter\ExcelToHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: IsTextEmpty which is more interested in members of the type: DataFormatter
Insufficient Modularization,NPOI.HSSF.Converter,ExcelToHtmlConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\svn2github_npoi\scratchpad\HSSF\Converter\ExcelToHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
