Duplicate Abstraction,BeIT.MemCached,FNV1_32,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\HashAlgorithms.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FNV1_32[1' 24]' LogAdapter[1' 24]' MemcachedClient[1' 24]' MemcachedClientException[1' 24]' PooledSocket[1' 24]' SerializedType[1' 24]' ServerPool[1' 24]' SocketPool[1' 24]
Unutilized Abstraction,BeIT.MemCached,FNV1a_32,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\HashAlgorithms.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BeIT.MemCached,LogAdapter,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\LogAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: LogAdapter[1' 25]' MemcachedClientException[1' 25]' MemcachedClient[1' 25]' ServerPool[1' 25]' SocketPool[1' 25]' PooledSocket[1' 25]' SerializedType[1' 25]
Multifaceted Abstraction,BeIT.MemCached,MemcachedClient,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\MemcachedClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Multifaceted Abstraction,BeIT.MemCached,ServerPool,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\ServerPool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Insufficient Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,MemcachedClient,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\MemcachedClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 68 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,MemcachedClient,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\MemcachedClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 87 methods
Insufficient Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,MemcachedClient,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\MemcachedClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 124
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,PooledSocket,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\PooledSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PooledSocket' SocketPool
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,PooledSocket,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\PooledSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PooledSocket' ServerPool' SocketPool
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,PooledSocket,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\PooledSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PooledSocket' SocketPool' ServerPool' SocketPool
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,PooledSocket,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\PooledSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PooledSocket' ServerPool' SocketPool' ServerPool' SocketPool
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BeIT.MemCached,ServerPool,C:\repos\mehfuzh_AutoBox\Libraries\BeIT.MemCached\ServerPool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServerPool' SocketPool
