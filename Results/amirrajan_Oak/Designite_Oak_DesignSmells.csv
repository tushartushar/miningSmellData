Missing Hierarchy,Massive,DynamicRepository,C:\repos\amirrajan_Oak\Oak\Massive.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DynamicModel' Gemini (in method "GetAttributesToSave" of class "DynamicRepository").
Broken Hierarchy,Massive,DynamicRepository,C:\repos\amirrajan_Oak\Oak\Massive.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Oak.Gemini
