Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BoC.Persistence.NHibernate,ISessionManager,C:\repos\csteeg_BoC\Src\Commons.Persistence.NHibernate\ISessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Session
Unutilized Abstraction,BoC.Persistence.NHibernate.Cache,ProjectionEnabledQueryCacheFactory,C:\repos\csteeg_BoC\Src\Commons.Persistence.NHibernate\Cache\ProjectionEnabledQueryCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BoC.Persistence.NHibernate.DataContext,DataContextSessionManager,C:\repos\csteeg_BoC\Src\Commons.Persistence.NHibernate\DataContext\DataContextWorkSessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Session
Unutilized Abstraction,BoC.Persistence.NHibernate.DataContext,DataContextException,C:\repos\csteeg_BoC\Src\Commons.Persistence.NHibernate\DataContext\DataContextWorkSessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,BoC.Persistence.NHibernate,NHibernateConfigHelper,C:\repos\csteeg_BoC\Src\Commons.Persistence.NHibernate\NHibernateConfigHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentSessionContextClass
Deficient Encapsulation,BoC.Persistence.NHibernate,NHibernateConfigHelper,C:\repos\csteeg_BoC\Src\Commons.Persistence.NHibernate\NHibernateConfigHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CurrentSessionContextClass
