Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RoslynQuoter,Quoter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KirillOsenkov_RoslynQuoter\src\Quoter\Quoter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,RoslynQuoter,Quoter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KirillOsenkov_RoslynQuoter\src\Quoter\Quoter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 53 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RoslynQuoter,Quoter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KirillOsenkov_RoslynQuoter\src\Quoter\Quoter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 248
Missing Hierarchy,RoslynQuoter,Quoter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KirillOsenkov_RoslynQuoter\src\Quoter\Quoter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ApiCall' MemberCall (in method "Print" of class "Quoter").
Broken Hierarchy,RoslynQuoter,MethodCall,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KirillOsenkov_RoslynQuoter\src\Quoter\Quoter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RoslynQuoter.MemberCall
