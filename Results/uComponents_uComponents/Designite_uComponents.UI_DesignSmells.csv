Unnecessary Abstraction,uComponents.UI,IResourceSet,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\IResourceSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Resources
Imperative Abstraction,uComponents.UI,ItemInfoService,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\ItemInfoService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessRequest
Unnecessary Abstraction,uComponents.UI,ResourceRegistration,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\ResourceRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResourceName' IsScript' Filters' Purposes
Unutilized Abstraction,uComponents.UI,uComponentsModule,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\uComponentsModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,uComponents.UI,UIExtensionResources,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\UIExtensionResources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: topFrame
Deficient Encapsulation,uComponents.UI,UIExtensionResources,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\UIExtensionResources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: topFrame
Broken Modularization,uComponents.UI,UIExtensionResources,C:\repos\uComponents_uComponents\src\uComponents.UI\UIExtensionResources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
