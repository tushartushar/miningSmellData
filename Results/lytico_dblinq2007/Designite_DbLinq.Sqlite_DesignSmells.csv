Unutilized Abstraction,DbLinq.Sqlite.Schema,DataCommand,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Sqlite\Schema\DataCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DbLinq.Sqlite.Schema,DataCommand,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Sqlite\Schema\DataCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DataCommand[1' 25]' SqliteSchemaLoader[1' 25]' SqliteDataContext[1' 25]' SqliteSqlProvider[1' 25]' SqliteVendor[1' 25]
