Unutilized Abstraction,DbLinq.Ingres,IngresSchemaLoader,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Ingres\IngresSchemaLoader.Columns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DbLinq.Ingres,IngresSchemaLoader,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Ingres\IngresSchemaLoader.Columns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IngresSchemaLoader[1' 25]' IngresDataContext[1' 25]' IngresSqlProvider[1' 25]' IngresVendor[1' 25]
Duplicate Abstraction,DbLinq.Ingres,IngresSqlProvider,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Ingres\IngresSqlProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IngresSqlProvider[1' 27]' IngresVendor[1' 27]
Imperative Abstraction,DbLinq.Ingres,IngresVendor,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Ingres\IngresVendor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExecuteMethodCall
Broken Hierarchy,DbLinq.Ingres,IngresDataContext,C:\repos\lytico_dblinq2007\src\DbLinq.Ingres\IngresDataContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DataContext
