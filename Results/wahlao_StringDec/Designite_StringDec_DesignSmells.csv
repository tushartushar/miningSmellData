Duplicate Abstraction,StringDec,Form2,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Form2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Form2[1' 26]' Form3[1' 26]
Duplicate Abstraction,StringDec,IImageResourceEntry,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\IImageResourceEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IImageResourceEntry[1' 23]' ImageResourceDataEntry[1' 23]' ImageResourceDirectory[1' 23]' ImageResourceDirectoryEntry[1' 23]
Unnecessary Abstraction,StringDec,ImageResourceDirectoryEntry,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\ImageResourceDirectoryEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' OffsetToData' Entry
Deficient Encapsulation,StringDec,Form1,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dataTable' FilterForm
Deficient Encapsulation,StringDec,ImageResourceDataEntry,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\ImageResourceDataEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OffsetToData' Size' CodePage' Reserved
Deficient Encapsulation,StringDec,ImageResourceDirectory,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\ImageResourceDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Entrys
Deficient Encapsulation,StringDec,ImageResourceDirectoryEntry,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\ImageResourceDirectoryEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' OffsetToData' Entry
Deficient Encapsulation,StringDec,Program,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MainForm' Args' rsrcVirtualAddress' rsrcPointerToRawData
Deficient Encapsulation,StringDec,Program,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MainForm' Args' rsrcVirtualAddress' rsrcPointerToRawData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StringDec,Form1,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Form1' Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StringDec,Form1,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Form1' Program' Form2
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StringDec,Form1,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Form1' Program' ImageResourceDirectory' Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StringDec,Form1,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Form1' Program' ImageResourceDirectory' Program' Form2
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StringDec,ImageResourceDirectory,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\ImageResourceDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageResourceDirectory' Program
Insufficient Modularization,StringDec,Program,C:\repos\wahlao_StringDec\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 320
