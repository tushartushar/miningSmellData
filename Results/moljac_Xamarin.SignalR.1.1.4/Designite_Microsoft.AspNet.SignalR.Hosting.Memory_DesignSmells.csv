Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,UrlEncoder,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Client\Infrastructure\UrlEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UrlEncode
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,DisposableAction,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\Infrastructure\DisposableAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,ProcessExtensions,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\Infrastructure\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin.Infrastructure,Headers,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\Infrastructure\Headers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory,ClientStream,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\ClientStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ClientStream[61' 86]' ServerStream[62' 87]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory,INetworkObserver,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\INetworkObserver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OnCancel' OnClose' OnWrite
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 57 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin,OwinConstants,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\Infrastructure\OwinConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' RequestBody' RequestHeaders' RequestScheme' RequestMethod' RequestPathBase' RequestPath' RequestQueryString' RequestProtocol' CallCancelled' ResponseStatusCode' ResponseReasonPhrase' ResponseHeaders' ResponseBody' TraceOutput' User' RemoteIpAddress' RemotePort' LocalIpAddress' LocalPort' DisableRequestCompression' DisableRequestBuffering' DisableResponseBuffering' ServerCapabilities' WebSocketVersion' WebSocketAccept' HostOnAppDisposing' HostAppNameKey' HostAppModeKey' AppModeDevelopment
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory,ClientStream,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\ClientStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Read' Seek' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory,ServerStream,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hosting.Memory\ServerStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Read' Seek' SetLength
