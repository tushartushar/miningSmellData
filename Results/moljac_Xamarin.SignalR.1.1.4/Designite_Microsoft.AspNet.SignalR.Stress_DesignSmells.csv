Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,TaskQueue,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\Infrastructure\TaskQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,StressRuns,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Stress\StressRuns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 57 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,RunData,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\RunData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Duration' Warmup' Transport' Payload' Senders' Connections' RedisServer' RedisPassword' RedisPort' SqlConnectionString' ServiceBusConnectionString' StreamCount
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,MemoryHostRun,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Performance\MemoryHostRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: InitializePerformanceCounters
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress.Hubs,EchoHub,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Hubs\EchoHub.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Hub
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress.Hubs,HubWithGroups,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Hubs\HubWithGroups.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Hub
