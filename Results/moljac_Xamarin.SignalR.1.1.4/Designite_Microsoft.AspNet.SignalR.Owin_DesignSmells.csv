Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reflection,AssemblyMetadataAttribute,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\..\Common\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,RequestExtensions,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\RequestExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin.Infrastructure,Headers,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\Infrastructure\Headers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin,OwinEnvironmentExtensions,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\Infrastructure\OwinEnvironmentExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,UrlDecoder,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\Infrastructure\UrlDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UrlDecode
Unutilized Abstraction,Owin,OwinExtensions,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\OwinExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 57 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin,OwinConstants,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Owin\Infrastructure\OwinConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' RequestBody' RequestHeaders' RequestScheme' RequestMethod' RequestPathBase' RequestPath' RequestQueryString' RequestProtocol' CallCancelled' ResponseStatusCode' ResponseReasonPhrase' ResponseHeaders' ResponseBody' TraceOutput' User' RemoteIpAddress' RemotePort' LocalIpAddress' LocalPort' DisableRequestCompression' DisableRequestBuffering' DisableResponseBuffering' ServerCapabilities' WebSocketVersion' WebSocketAccept' HostOnAppDisposing' HostAppNameKey' HostAppModeKey' AppModeDevelopment
