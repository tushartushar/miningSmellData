Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reflection,AssemblyMetadataAttribute,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis\..\Common\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,DependencyResolverExtensions,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis\DependencyResolverExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 57 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\moljac_Xamarin.SignalR.1.1.4\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Redis\..\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
