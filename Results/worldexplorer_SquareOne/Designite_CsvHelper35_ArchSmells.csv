Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,CsvHelper35,CsvHelper.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: CsvHelper.Configuration' CsvHelper,CsvHelper.Configuration.CsvClassMap' CsvHelper.CsvParser' CsvHelper.CsvReader
Unstable Dependency,CsvHelper35,CsvHelper.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CsvHelper,CsvHelper.Configuration.ReflectionHelper
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.74  All the dependencies among components: from: CsvHelper.Configuration' to: CsvHelper' from: CsvHelper.Configuration' to: CsvHelper.TypeConversion' from: CsvHelper' to:
