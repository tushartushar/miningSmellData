Unutilized Abstraction,ArusSoft,AboutForm,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\AboutForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ArusSoft,ReportForm,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\ReportForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ArusSoft,Settings,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ArusSoft.Settings' ArusSoft.Properties.Settings
Unnecessary Abstraction,ArusSoft.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,ArusSoft,Command,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Terminal' TerminalLine
Deficient Encapsulation,ArusSoft,Global,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DB' DBHelp
Deficient Encapsulation,ArusSoft,Global,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DB' DBHelp
Broken Modularization,ArusSoft,Command,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' DateCreate' CommandText' CommandOutput' CommandError' Terminal' TerminalLine
Broken Modularization,ArusSoft,CommandHelp,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' CategoryID' Category' Title' Body' VersionControl
Insufficient Modularization,ArusSoft,MainForm,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ArusSoft,MainForm,C:\repos\ArusSoft_dotNet-Application-WinTerminal\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 139
