Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,iTuner,UsbDisk,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\UsbDisk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,iTuner,UsbManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\UsbManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,iTuner,DEV_BROADCAST_VOLUME,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\UsbManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dbcv_size' dbcv_devicetype' dbcv_reserved' dbcv_unitmask' dbcv_flags
Unutilized Abstraction,iTuner,USBAudioDeviceItems,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\UsbManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,iTuner,WmiExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\WmiExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,iTuner,DEV_BROADCAST_VOLUME,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\UsbManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dbcv_size' dbcv_devicetype' dbcv_reserved' dbcv_unitmask' dbcv_flags
Broken Modularization,iTuner,DEV_BROADCAST_VOLUME,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nkc3g4_wtg-assistant\iTuner\UsbManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dbcv_size' dbcv_devicetype' dbcv_reserved' dbcv_unitmask' dbcv_flags
