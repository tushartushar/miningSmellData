Unnecessary Abstraction,Ninject.Extensions.Logging.Classes,NonPublicPropertyLoggerClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.logging\src\Ninject.Extensions.Logging.Tests\Classes\NonPublicPropertyLoggerClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Logger

Insufficient Modularization,Ninject.Extensions.Logging.Classes,CtorPropertyLoggerClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.logging\src\Ninject.Extensions.Logging.Tests\Classes\CtorPropertyLoggerClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
