Imperative Abstraction,Quartz.Job,DirectoryScanJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\DirectoryScanJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Imperative Abstraction,Quartz.Job,FileScanJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\FileScanJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Imperative Abstraction,Quartz.Job,NativeJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\NativeJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Imperative Abstraction,Quartz.Job,SendMailJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\SendMailJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unnecessary Abstraction,Quartz.Job,MailInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\SendMailJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MailMessage' SmtpHost' SmtpPort' SmtpUserName' SmtpPassword
Broken Modularization,Quartz.Job,MailInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\SendMailJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MailMessage' SmtpHost' SmtpPort' SmtpUserName' SmtpPassword
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Quartz.Job,DirectoryScanJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\DirectoryScanJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJob' Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJobModel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Quartz.Spi,IDirectoryProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\SPI\IDirectoryProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Quartz.Spi.IDirectoryProvider' Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJob
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Quartz.Job,DirectoryScanJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\DirectoryScanJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJob' Quartz.Simpl.DefaultDirectoryProvider' Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJobModel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Quartz.Job,DirectoryScanJobModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\DirectoryScanJobModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJobModel' Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJob' Quartz.Spi.IDirectoryProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Quartz.Job,DirectoryScanJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\DirectoryScanJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJob' Quartz.Spi.IDirectoryProvider' Quartz.Simpl.DefaultDirectoryProvider' Quartz.Job.DirectoryScanJobModel
Unfactored Hierarchy,Quartz.Job,FileScanJob,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\FileScanJob.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FileScanJob (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\FileScanJob.cs' [1' 20])' NativeJob (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\quartznet_quartznet\src\Quartz.Jobs\Job\NativeJob.cs' [1' 20])
