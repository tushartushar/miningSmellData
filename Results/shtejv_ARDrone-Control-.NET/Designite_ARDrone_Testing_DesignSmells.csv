Feature Envy,ARDrone.Testing,TimeBasedCommandUnitTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\shtejv_ARDrone-Control-.NET\ARDrone_Testing\TimeBasedCommandUnitTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestNormalFlow which is more interested in members of the type: TimeBasedCommand
