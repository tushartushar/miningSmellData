Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Synthesis.Testing.Attributes,AutoNSubstituteAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kamsar_Synthesis\Source\Synthesis.Testing\Attributes\AutoNSubstituteAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Synthesis.Testing,TestFieldType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kamsar_Synthesis\Source\Synthesis.Testing\TestFieldType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HasValue' Id
Wide Hierarchy,Synthesis.Testing,TestFieldType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kamsar_Synthesis\Source\Synthesis.Testing\TestFieldType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Synthesis.Testing.TestBooleanField' Synthesis.Testing.TestDateTimeField' Synthesis.Testing.TestDictionaryField' Synthesis.Testing.TestFileField' Synthesis.Testing.TestHyperlinkField' Synthesis.Testing.TestIntegerField' Synthesis.Testing.TestItemReferenceField' Synthesis.Testing.TestItemReferenceListField' Synthesis.Testing.TestNumericField' Synthesis.Testing.TestTextField' Synthesis.Testing.TestTristateField
Rebellious Hierarchy,Synthesis.Testing,TestHyperlinkField,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kamsar_Synthesis\Source\Synthesis.Testing\TestHyperlinkField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToLinkField
Rebellious Hierarchy,Synthesis.Testing,TestItemReferenceField,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kamsar_Synthesis\Source\Synthesis.Testing\TestItemReferenceField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToReferenceField
Rebellious Hierarchy,Synthesis.Testing,TestItemReferenceListField,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kamsar_Synthesis\Source\Synthesis.Testing\TestItemReferenceListField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToMultilistField
