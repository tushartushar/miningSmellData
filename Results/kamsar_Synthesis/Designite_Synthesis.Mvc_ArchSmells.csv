Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Synthesis.Mvc' Synthesis.Mvc.Pipelines.GetRenderer,Synthesis.Mvc.RenderingDisplayPathResolver' Synthesis.Mvc.TagRenderingContext<T>' Synthesis.Mvc.ViewErrorRenderer' Synthesis.Mvc.Pipelines.GetRenderer.RenderingDiagnosticsInjector
Unstable Dependency,Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc.Pipelines.GetRenderer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc.Pipelines.GetRenderer.RenderingDisplayPathResolver
Feature Concentration,Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DateFields]' [FileHelper]' [HyperlinkFields]' [ImageFields]' [NumberFields]' [TextFields]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions.FileHelper' Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions.HyperlinkFields' Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions.ImageFields' Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions.NumberFields' Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions.TextFields
