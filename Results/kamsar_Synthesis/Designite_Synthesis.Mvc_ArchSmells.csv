Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Synthesis.Mvc' Synthesis.Mvc.Pipelines.GetRenderer
Unstable Dependency,Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc.Pipelines.GetRenderer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Synthesis.Mvc
Feature Concentration,Synthesis.Mvc,Synthesis.Mvc.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DateFields]' [FileHelper]' [HyperlinkFields]' [ImageFields]' [NumberFields]' [TextFields]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
