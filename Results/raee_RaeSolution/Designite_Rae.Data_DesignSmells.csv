Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' ConnectionString
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rae.Data.Dapper,AssemblyNeutralAttribute,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\AssemblyNeutralAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Rae.Data.Dapper,AssemblyNeutralAttribute,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\AssemblyNeutralAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rae.Data.Dapper,CustomPropertyTypeMap,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\CustomPropertyTypeMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Rae.Data.Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Unutilized Abstraction,Rae.Data,IQuery,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\IQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rae.Data.Oracle,OracleConnectionManager,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Oracle\OracleConnectionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rae.Data.Oracle,OracleQuery,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Oracle\OracleQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,CommandDefinition,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\CommandDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CommandDefinition' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,CommandDefinition,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\CommandDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CommandDefinition' SqlMapper' DynamicParameters' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,DefaultTypeMap,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\DefaultTypeMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DefaultTypeMap' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,DefaultTypeMap,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\DefaultTypeMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DefaultTypeMap' SqlMapper' DynamicParameters' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,DynamicParameters,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\DynamicParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DynamicParameters' SqlMapper
Insufficient Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 83 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Rae.Data.Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\raee_RaeSolution\Rae.Data\Dapper\SqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 399
