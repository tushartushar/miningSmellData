Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Bitcoin Tool,Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts' Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto,Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts.ValidationExtensions' Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts.SigningExtensions' Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts.Script' Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto.Address
Unstable Dependency,Bitcoin Tool,Bitcoin_Tool.Util,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto,Bitcoin_Tool.Util.PublicKey
Unstable Dependency,Bitcoin Tool,Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts,Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto.Script' Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto.ScriptElement
Scattered Functionality,Bitcoin Tool,Bitcoin_Tool.Scripts,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Bitcoin_Tool.Structs' Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto,Bitcoin_Tool.Structs.Transaction' Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto.PrivateKey' Bitcoin_Tool.Crypto.PublicKey
