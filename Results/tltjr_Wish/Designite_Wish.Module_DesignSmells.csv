Unutilized Abstraction,Wish,ModifierKeyExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tltjr_Wish\WishModule\ModifierKeyExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Wish,WishModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tltjr_Wish\WishModule\WishModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Execute which is more interested in members of the type: IRepl
Unutilized Abstraction,Wish,WishModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tltjr_Wish\WishModule\WishModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Wish.State,WishArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tltjr_Wish\WishModule\State\WishArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TextEditor' OnClosed' Execute' Key' WorkingDirectory
