Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,Address,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Lines
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,Category,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\Category.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Products' products
Unutilized Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,CodeFirstContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\CodeFirstContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,CountryCode,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\CountryCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Code' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,DomesticAddress,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\DomesticAddress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Postcode
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,InternationalAddress,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\InternationalAddress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Country
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestCodeOnly,AbstractPerson,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\Person.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TestCodeOnly,Category,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\Category.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TestCodeOnly.Category' TestCodeOnly.Product
Broken Hierarchy,TestCodeOnly,AbstractPerson,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NakedObjectsGroup_NakedObjectsFramework\Core\NakedObjects.Persistor.Entity.Test.CodeOnly\TestCodeOnly\Person.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestCodeOnly.AbstractTestCode
