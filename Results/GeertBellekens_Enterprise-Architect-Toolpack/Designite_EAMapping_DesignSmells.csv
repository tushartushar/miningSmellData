Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EAMapping,EAMappingAddin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\EAMappingAddin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,EAMapping,MappingLogicControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\MappingLogicControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: setContexts
Unnecessary Abstraction,EAMapping,DefaultSelection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\MappingLogicControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: name
Imperative Abstraction,EAMapping,SelectTargetForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\SelectTargetForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: setItems
Deficient Encapsulation,EAMapping,MappingControlGUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\MappingControlGUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: sourceColumn
Insufficient Modularization,EAMapping,EAMappingAddin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\EAMappingAddin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Broken Modularization,EAMapping,EAMappingSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\EAMappingSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: configSubPath' defaultConfigFilePath' useTaggedValues' linkedAttributeTagName' linkedAssociationTagName' linkedElementTagName' useInlineMappingLogic' mappingLogicType' outputName' contextQuery
Insufficient Modularization,EAMapping,MappingControlGUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAMapping\MappingControlGUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
