Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,EAValidator,CheckGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAValidator\CheckGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetAllChecks
Unnecessary Abstraction,EAValidator,CheckItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAValidator\CheckItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: name' selected
Unutilized Abstraction,EAValidator,EAValidatorAddin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\EAValidator\EAValidatorAddin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
