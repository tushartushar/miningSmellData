Imperative Abstraction,MagicdrawMigrator,ConvertPropertiesToAttributes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\Correctors\ConvertPropertiesToAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: correct
Unutilized Abstraction,MagicdrawMigrator,MDAbstraction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\UML\MDAbstraction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MagicdrawMigrator,MagicDrawReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\MagicDrawReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MagicdrawMigrator,MagicDrawReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\MagicDrawReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 198
Unfactored Hierarchy,MagicdrawMigrator,AddCrossMDzipRelationsCorrector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\Correctors\AddCrossMDzipRelationsCorrector.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  AddCrossMDzipRelationsCorrector (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\Correctors\AddCrossMDzipRelationsCorrector.cs' [154' 174])' ASMAAssociationCorrector (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\Correctors\ASMAAssociationCorrector.cs' [102' 122])
Wide Hierarchy,MagicdrawMigrator,MagicDrawCorrector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GeertBellekens_Enterprise-Architect-Toolpack\MagicdrawMigrator\Correctors\MagicDrawCorrector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: MagicdrawMigrator.AddClassifiersToPartitions' MagicdrawMigrator.AddCrossMDzipRelationsCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.AddGuardConditions' MagicdrawMigrator.ASMAAssociationCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.AssociationTableCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.AttributeSequenceCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.ConvertPropertiesToAttributes' MagicdrawMigrator.CrossMDzipAttributeCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.AssociationCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.LinksAttributesEnumsCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.MigrateDependencyMatrix' MagicdrawMigrator.NotesCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.RelationsCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.SequenceDiagramCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.CorrectStereotypesAndTaggedValues' MagicdrawMigrator.DiagramLayoutCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.FixCallBehaviorActionCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.OCLConstraintsCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.SetStatesOnObjects' MagicdrawMigrator.SetStructureCorrector' MagicdrawMigrator.TimeEventsCorrector
