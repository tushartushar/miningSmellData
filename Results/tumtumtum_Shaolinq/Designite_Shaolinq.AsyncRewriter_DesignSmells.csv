Unnecessary Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,ValidatorResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\AsyncMethodValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FileName' Position' MethodInvocationSyntax' ReplacementExpressionSyntax' ReplacementMethodSymbol
Duplicate Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,GeneratedAsyncMethodSubstitutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\GeneratedAsyncMethodSubstitutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GeneratedAsyncMethodSubstitutor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\GeneratedAsyncMethodSubstitutor.cs' [40' 85])' MethodInvocationInspector (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\MethodInvocationInspector.cs' [113' 158])
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,MethodSymbolExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\MethodSymbolExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,Rewriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\Rewriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Rewriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\Rewriter.cs' [190' 216])' Rewriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\Rewriter.cs' [319' 345])
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,AsyncRewriterTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\AsyncRewriterTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,MethodDeclarationSyntaxExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\MethodDeclarationSyntaxExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,SyntaxListExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\SyntaxListExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,UsingsComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\UsingsComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter,ValidatorResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.AsyncRewriter\AsyncMethodValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
