Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,DisabledForeignKeyCheckContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\DisabledForeignKeyCheckContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteSqlDatabaseSchemaManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\GeneratedAsync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Duplicate Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteSqlDatabaseSchemaManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\GeneratedAsync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SqliteSqlDatabaseSchemaManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\GeneratedAsync.cs' [66' 96])' SqliteSqlDatabaseSchemaManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\GeneratedAsync.cs' [99' 129])
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,RewriteAsyncAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\RewriteAsyncAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteErrorCodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteErrorCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SqliteConstraint
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteErrorCodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteErrorCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteOfficialAssemblyReference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteOfficialAssemblyReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' connection
Unutilized Abstraction,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteOfficialAssemblyReference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteOfficialAssemblyReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteMonoSqlDatabaseContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteMonoSqlDatabaseContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Shaolinq.Sqlite.SqliteMonoSqlDatabaseContext' Shaolinq.Sqlite.SqliteSqlDatabaseContextInfo
Rebellious Hierarchy,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqlitePersistentDbConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqlitePersistentDbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose' Close
Broken Hierarchy,Shaolinq.Sqlite,SqliteSqlDataTypeProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tumtumtum_Shaolinq\src\Shaolinq.Sqlite\SqliteSqlDataTypeProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Shaolinq.Persistence.DefaultSqlDataTypeProvider
