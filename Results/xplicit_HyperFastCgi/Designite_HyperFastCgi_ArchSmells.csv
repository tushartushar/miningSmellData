Cyclic Dependency,HyperFastCgi,HyperFastCgi.Helpers.Logging,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: HyperFastCgi.Helpers.Logging' HyperFastCgi.Helpers,HyperFastCgi.Helpers.Logging.Logger' HyperFastCgi.Helpers.ThreadHelper
Unstable Dependency,HyperFastCgi,HyperFastCgi.Helpers.Logging,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): HyperFastCgi.Helpers,HyperFastCgi.Helpers.Logging.Strings
Unstable Dependency,HyperFastCgi,HyperFastCgi.Helpers.FastCgiProtocol,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): HyperFastCgi.Helpers,HyperFastCgi.Helpers.FastCgiProtocol.Strings
