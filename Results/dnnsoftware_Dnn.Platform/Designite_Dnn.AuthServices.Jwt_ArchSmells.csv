Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Auth,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Auth' Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Components.Common.Controllers,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Auth.JwtAuthMessageHandler' Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Components.Common.Controllers.IJwtController' Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Components.Common.Controllers.JwtController
Unstable Dependency,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Auth,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Components.Common.Controllers,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Auth.IJwtController
Scattered Functionality,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt,Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Components.Common.Controllers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: DotNetNuke.Entities.Portals' Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Data,DotNetNuke.Entities.Portals.IPortalController' Dnn.AuthServices.Jwt.Data.IDataService
