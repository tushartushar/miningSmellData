Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.AzureFolderProvider,AzureBlob,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\AzureFolderProvider\AzureBlob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.AzureFolderProvider,AzureRemoteStorageItem,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\AzureFolderProvider\AzureRemoteStorageItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Blob' Key' LastModified' Size' HashCode
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.AzureFolderProvider,BlobItemExtensions,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\AzureFolderProvider\BlobItemExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.Components,IRemoteStorageItem,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\Components\IRemoteStorageItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' LastModified' Size' HashCode
Broken Modularization,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.AzureFolderProvider,AzureRemoteStorageItem,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\AzureFolderProvider\AzureRemoteStorageItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Blob' Key' LastModified' Size' HashCode
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.Components,BaseRemoteStorageProvider,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\Components\BaseRemoteStorageProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.Components,BaseRemoteStorageProvider,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\Components\BaseRemoteStorageProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetNuke.Providers.FolderProviders.Components,BaseRemoteStorageProvider,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Providers\FolderProviders\Components\BaseRemoteStorageProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetFileAttributes
