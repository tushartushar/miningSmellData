Unnecessary Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,BasicClientDependencyPath,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\BasicClientDependencyPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Path' ResolvedPath
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,IClientDependencyPath,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\IClientDependencyPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Path' ForceBundle
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,ProviderDependencyList,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\ProviderDependencyList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core,CompositeDependencyHandler,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\CompositeDependencyHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core.Controls,ClientDependencyLoader,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\Controls\ClientDependencyLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClientDependency.Core.Controls,ClientDependencyPathCollection,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\Controls\ClientDependencyPathCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Modularization,ClientDependency.Core,IClientDependencyFile,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\IClientDependencyFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FilePath' DependencyType' Priority' Group' PathNameAlias' ForceProvider' ForceBundle' Name' Version' ForceVersion
Broken Modularization,ClientDependency.Core.Config,ClientDependencySection,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\Config\ClientDependencySection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Version' MachineName' CompositeFileElement' FileRegistrationElement' MvcElement' LoggerType' Filters' FileBasedDepdendenyExtensions' AllowOnlyFipsAlgorithms' FileBasedDependencyExtensionList' _filters
Broken Hierarchy,ClientDependency.Core.Controls,CssInclude,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\Controls\CssInclude.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ClientDependency.Core.Controls.ClientDependencyInclude
Broken Hierarchy,ClientDependency.Core.Controls,JsInclude,C:\repos\dnnsoftware_Dnn.Platform\DNN Platform\Components\ClientDependency\Source\Controls\JsInclude.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ClientDependency.Core.Controls.ClientDependencyInclude
