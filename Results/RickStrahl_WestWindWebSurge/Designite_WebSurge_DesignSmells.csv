Deficient Encapsulation,WebSurge,UnlockKeyForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RickStrahl_WestWindWebSurge\WebSurge\UnlockKeyForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SoftwareName
Insufficient Modularization,WebSurge,StressTestForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RickStrahl_WestWindWebSurge\WebSurge\StressTestForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WebSurge,StressTestForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RickStrahl_WestWindWebSurge\WebSurge\StressTestForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 228
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebSurge,FiddlerCapture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RickStrahl_WestWindWebSurge\WebSurge\FiddlerCapture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebSurge.FiddlerCapture' WebSurge.StressTestForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebSurge,RegisterDialog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RickStrahl_WestWindWebSurge\WebSurge\RegisterDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebSurge.RegisterDialog' WebSurge.StressTestForm
