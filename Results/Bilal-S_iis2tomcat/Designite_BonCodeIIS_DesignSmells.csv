Unutilized Abstraction,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BonCodeCallHandler (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs' [1' 22])' WebManagement (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\WebManagement.cs' [1' 22])' BonCodeTCPClient (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\Mock\BonCodeTCPClient.cs' [1' 22])
Unnecessary Abstraction,BonCodeIIS.Mock,BonCodeTCPClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\Mock\BonCodeTCPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,BonCodeIIS.Mock,BonCodeTCPClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\Mock\BonCodeTCPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TomcatSendHeaders' TomcatEndResponse' TomcatSendBodyChunk (in method "PrintFlush" of class "BonCodeCallHandler").
Insufficient Modularization,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
