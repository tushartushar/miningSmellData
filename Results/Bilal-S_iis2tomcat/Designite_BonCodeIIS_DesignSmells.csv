Imperative Abstraction,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessRequest
Unutilized Abstraction,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BonCodeCallHandler[1' 22]' WebManagement[1' 22]' BonCodeTCPClient[1' 22]
Unutilized Abstraction,BonCodeIIS,WebManagement,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\WebManagement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BonCodeIIS.Mock,BonCodeTCPClient,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\Mock\BonCodeTCPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,BonCodeIIS.Mock,BonCodeTCPClient,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\Mock\BonCodeTCPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TomcatSendHeaders' TomcatEndResponse' TomcatSendBodyChunk (in method "PrintFlush" of class "BonCodeCallHandler").
Insufficient Modularization,BonCodeIIS,BonCodeCallHandler,F:\newReposMay17\Bilal-S_iis2tomcat\BonCodeIIS\CallHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 126
