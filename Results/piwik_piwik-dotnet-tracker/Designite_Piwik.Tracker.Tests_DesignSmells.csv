Feature Envy,Piwik.Tracker.Tests,PiwikTrackerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\piwik_piwik-dotnet-tracker\Piwik.Tracker.Tests\PiwikTrackerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetCustomVariable_WhenVariableIsSet_ReturnsCorrectVariable which is more interested in members of the type: PiwikTracker

Insufficient Modularization,Piwik.Tracker.Tests,PiwikTrackerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\piwik_piwik-dotnet-tracker\Piwik.Tracker.Tests\PiwikTrackerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
