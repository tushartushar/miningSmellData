Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmarque.Console.Implementations,NodeList<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Benchmarque\src\Benchmarque.Console\Implementations\NodeList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarque.Console.Implementations,TarjanNodeProperties,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Benchmarque\src\Benchmarque.Console\Implementations\TarjanNodeProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Index' LowLink
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarque.Console.Implementations,TopologicalSortNodeProperties,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Benchmarque\src\Benchmarque.Console\Implementations\TopologicalSortNodeProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Visited
Deficient Encapsulation,Benchmarque.Console.Implementations,DependencyGraphNode<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Benchmarque\src\Benchmarque.Console\Implementations\DependencyGraphNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Index' LowLink' Visited
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Benchmarque.Console.Implementations,DependencyGraphNode<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Benchmarque\src\Benchmarque.Console\Implementations\DependencyGraphNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Benchmarque.Console.Implementations.DependencyGraphNode<T>' Benchmarque.Console.Implementations.Node<T>
