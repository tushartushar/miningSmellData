Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServerManager,ObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\ObjectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ServerManager,ServerManagerForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\ServerManagerForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: AddServer
Imperative Abstraction,ServerManager.ServerDetails,ServerDetailsView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\ServerDetails\ServerDetailsView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialise
Unutilized Abstraction,ServerManager.ServerDetails,ServerDetailsView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\ServerDetails\ServerDetailsView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServerManager.ShellDebugger,ShellTreeView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\ShellDebugger\ShellTreeView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServerManager.TestShell,ShellThumbnailHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\TestShell\ShellThumbnailHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServerManager.TestShell,ShellPreviewHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\TestShell\ShellPreviewHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServerManager.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RecentlyUsedFiles' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,ServerManager,ServerManagerForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\ServerManagerForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServerManager.TestShell,TestShellForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\TestShell\TestShellForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServerManager,AboutForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\About\AboutForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServerManager.AboutForm' ServerManager.ServerManagerForm
Missing Hierarchy,ServerManager.TestShell,ShellPreviewHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\Tools\ServerManager\TestShell\ShellPreviewHost.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IInitializeWithFile' IInitializeWithStream (in method "SetPreviewItem" of class "ShellPreviewHost").
