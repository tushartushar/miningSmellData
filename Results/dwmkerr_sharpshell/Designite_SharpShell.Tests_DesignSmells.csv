Feature Envy,SharpShell.Tests.ServerRegistration,ServerRegistrationManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\SharpShell.Tests\ServerRegistration\ServerRegistrationManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Register_Server_Associations_Uses_Appropriate_Class_Id_For_Class_Of_Extension which is more interested in members of the type: InMemoryRegistry
Feature Envy,SharpShell.Tests.ServerRegistration,ServerRegistrationManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpshell\SharpShell\SharpShell.Tests\ServerRegistration\ServerRegistrationManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Register_Server_Associations_Creates_Class_Ids_For_Extension_Of_Class_If_Needed which is more interested in members of the type: InMemoryRegistry
