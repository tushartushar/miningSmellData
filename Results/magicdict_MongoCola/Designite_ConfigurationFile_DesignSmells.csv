Unutilized Abstraction,ConfigurationFile,CtlConfigItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MongoCola\ConfigurationFile\ctlConfigItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ConfigurationFile,Main,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MongoCola\ConfigurationFile\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: lstConfigValue_SelectedIndexChanged which is more interested in members of the type: CtlConfigItem
Unnecessary Abstraction,ConfigurationFile.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MongoCola\ConfigurationFile\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,ConfigurationFile,ConfigItemDefine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MongoCola\ConfigurationFile\ConfigItemDefine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConfigurationItemDictionary' SelectedConfigurationValueDictionary' DefineFilename' ValueFilename
Deficient Encapsulation,ConfigurationFile,ConfigItemDefine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MongoCola\ConfigurationFile\ConfigItemDefine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConfigurationItemDictionary' SelectedConfigurationValueDictionary' DefineFilename' ValueFilename
