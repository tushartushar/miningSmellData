Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests,FlowStepData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\ExecutionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Line' Exception' Notes' Skipped
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests,ExperienceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\ExperienceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests,ExplanationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\ExplanationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests,ExplanationData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\ExplanationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Code' Name' Text' Link
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests.Internal,MirrorSharpTestDriverExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\Internal\MirrorSharpTestDriverExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests.Internal,TestEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\Internal\TestEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Container' MirrorSharpOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpLab.Tests.Internal,TestModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\Internal\TestModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SharpLab.Tests,ExecutionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\ExecutionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpLab.Tests,DecompilationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ashmind_TryRoslyn\source\NetFramework\Tests\DecompilationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpLab.Tests.DecompilationTests' SharpLab.Tests.Internal.TestCode
