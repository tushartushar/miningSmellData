Multipath Hierarchy,Bifrost.FluentValidation.Commands,CommandBusinessValidator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\CommandBusinessValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICanValidate
Multipath Hierarchy,Bifrost.FluentValidation.Commands,CommandInputValidator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\CommandInputValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICanValidate
Multipath Hierarchy,Bifrost.FluentValidation.Commands,ComposedCommandBusinessValidator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\ComposedCommandBusinessValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICanValidate
Unfactored Hierarchy,Bifrost.FluentValidation.Commands,ComposedCommandBusinessValidator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\ComposedCommandBusinessValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  ComposedCommandBusinessValidator<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\ComposedCommandBusinessValidator.cs' [26' 54])' ComposedCommandInputValidator<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\ComposedCommandInputValidator.cs' [25' 53])
Multipath Hierarchy,Bifrost.FluentValidation.Commands,ComposedCommandInputValidator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.FluentValidation\Commands\ComposedCommandInputValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICanValidate
