List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FixedStringSegmentBuilder (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost\Strings\FixedStringSegmentBuilder.cs' [109' 130])' VariableStringSegmentBuilder (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost\Strings\VariableStringSegmentBuilder.cs' [109' 130])
Cyclic Hierarchy,Bifrost.Strings,ISegment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost\Strings\ISegment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: VariableStringSegment
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bifrost.Strings,NullSegmentBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost\Strings\NullSegmentBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddChild
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bifrost.Strings,Segment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost\Strings\Segment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Match
