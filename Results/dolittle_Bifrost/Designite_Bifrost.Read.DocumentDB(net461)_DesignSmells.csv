Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Bifrost.Configuration,ConfigurationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Entities\ConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities,EntityContextConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Entities\EntityContextConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Url' DatabaseId' AuthorizationKey' EntityContextType' Connection
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bifrost.DocumentDB,IHaveDocumentType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\IHaveDocumentType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: _DOCUMENT_TYPE
Unutilized Abstraction,Bifrost.DocumentDB,QueryableExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\QueryableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Mapping,DocumentMapFor<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Mapping\DocumentMapFor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Mapping,DocumentMapFor<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Mapping\DocumentMapFor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Mapping,PropertyMapExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Mapping\PropertyMapExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Read,QueryProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Read\QueryProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Execute which is more interested in members of the type: EntityContextConnection
Broken Modularization,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities,EntityContextConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Entities\EntityContextConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Url' DatabaseId' AuthorizationKey' EntityContextType' Connection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities,EntityContext<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Entities\EntityContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities.EntityContext<T>' Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities.EntityContextConfiguration' Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities.EntityContextConnection
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Entities,EntityContext<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Entities\EntityContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Attach' Delete' Commit' DeleteById
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bifrost.DocumentDB.Mapping,KeyStrategy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dolittle_Bifrost\Source\Bifrost.Read.DocumentDB\Mapping\KeyStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Perform
