Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests,ScreenRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\ScreenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests,ScreenRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\ScreenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestGetForCachedModeTest which is more interested in members of the type: ScreenRepositoryTester
Feature Envy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests,ScreenRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\ScreenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ControlsWithSameNameAreResolvedUsingIndexTest which is more interested in members of the type: ScreenRepositoryTester
Feature Envy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests,ScreenRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\ScreenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ComponentsAreInjectedTest which is more interested in members of the type: ScreenRepositoryTester
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests.EntityMapping,EntitiesFromUIItemsTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\EntityMapping\EntitiesFromUIItemsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests.EntityMapping,EntitiesFromUIItemsTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\EntityMapping\EntitiesFromUIItemsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FromTable which is more interested in members of the type: Window
Multifaceted Abstraction,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests.Testing,MainScreen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\Testing\MainScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Broken Hierarchy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests,DummyScreen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\DummyScreen.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.AppScreen
Broken Hierarchy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests.Testing,BaseScreen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\Testing\BaseScreen.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.AppScreen
Broken Hierarchy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests.Testing,MainProgressBars,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\Testing\MainProgressBars.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.AppScreenComponent
Broken Hierarchy,TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests.Testing,ModalScreen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_White\src\TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.UITests\Testing\ModalScreen.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestStack.White.ScreenObjects.AppScreen
