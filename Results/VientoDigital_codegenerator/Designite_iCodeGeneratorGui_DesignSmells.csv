Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,AboutWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\AboutWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,AboutWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\AboutWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AboutWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\AboutWindow.cs' [27' 51])' DirectorySelectionWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\DirectorySelectionWindow.cs' [35' 59])' UpdatesWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\UpdatesWindow.cs' [28' 52])
Imperative Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,MainApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\MainApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Feature Envy,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,MainApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\MainApp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SfSnippetSelected which is more interested in members of the type: DocumentForm
Feature Envy,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,MainApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\MainApp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SelectTemplatesDirectory which is more interested in members of the type: DirectorySelectionWindow
Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,UpdatesWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\UpdatesWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,MainApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\Forms\MainApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
