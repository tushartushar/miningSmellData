Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,AboutWindow,C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\AboutWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,AboutWindow,C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\AboutWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AboutWindow (C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\AboutWindow.cs' [26' 49])' DirectorySelectionWindow (C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\DirectorySelectionWindow.cs' [33' 56])' UpdatesWindow (C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\UpdatesWindow.cs' [29' 52])
Imperative Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,MainApp,C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\MainApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.iCodeGeneratorGui,UpdatesWindow,C:\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\iCodeGeneratorGui\UpdatesWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
