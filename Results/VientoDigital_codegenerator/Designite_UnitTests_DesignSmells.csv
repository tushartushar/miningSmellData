Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestConnectionStringManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestConnectionStringManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestDatabaseNavigator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestDatabaseNavigator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestDatabaseNavigator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestDatabaseNavigator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestDatabaseCollectionRemoveAndReload which is more interested in members of the type: Server
Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestDataTypeManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestDataTypeManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestDataTypeManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestDataTypeManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestMappings which is more interested in members of the type: DataTypeManager
Unutilized Abstraction,iCodeGenerator.UnitTests,TestFileGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\VientoDigital_codegenerator\src\UnitTests\TestFileGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
