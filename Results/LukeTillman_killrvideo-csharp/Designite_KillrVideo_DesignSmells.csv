Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,KillrVideo.Listeners,BroadcastOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\Listeners\BroadcastOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IP' Port
Feature Envy,KillrVideo.Listeners,RegisterWithEtcdListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\Listeners\RegisterWithEtcdListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetServiceKey which is more interested in members of the type: HostOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,KillrVideo.Configuration,HostConfigurationFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\Configuration\HostConfigurationFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KillrVideo.MessageBus,TransportFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\MessageBus\TransportFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Transport
Unutilized Abstraction,KillrVideo.MessageBus,TransportFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\MessageBus\TransportFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KillrVideo.ServiceDiscovery,EtcdClientFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\ServiceDiscovery\EtcdClientFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KillrVideo.ServiceDiscovery,EtcdOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\ServiceDiscovery\EtcdOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IP' Port
Unutilized Abstraction,KillrVideo.ServiceDiscovery,EtcdServiceDiscovery,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\ServiceDiscovery\EtcdServiceDiscovery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,KillrVideo.MessageBus,TransportFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\MessageBus\TransportFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Transport
Deficient Encapsulation,KillrVideo.MessageBus,TransportFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LukeTillman_killrvideo-csharp\src\KillrVideo\MessageBus\TransportFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Transport
