Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SAPIBase,AddInAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\AddIns\AddInAttrib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DisplayName
Unutilized Abstraction,SAPIBase,AddInAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\AddIns\AddInAttrib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SAPIBase,AddIn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\AddIns\AddInManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DisplayName' Path
Unnecessary Abstraction,SAPIBase,SettingAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Display
Duplicate Abstraction,SAPIBase,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SAPIBase.Settings' SAPIBase.Properties.Settings
Unnecessary Abstraction,SAPIBase,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\Steam Context\Steam.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' AppID' Icon
Unnecessary Abstraction,SAPIBase.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SAPIBase,GameControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\UI\Controls\GameControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SAPIBase.GameControl' SAPIBase.GamePanel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SAPIBase,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\UI\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SAPIBase.MainForm' SAPIBase.GameControl
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SAPIBase,GameControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\UI\Controls\GameControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SAPIBase.GameControl' SAPIBase.MainForm' SAPIBase.GamePanel
Rebellious Hierarchy,SAPIBase,GameControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteamRE_open-steamworks\Projects\SAPIBase\SAPIBase\UI\Controls\GameControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnDoubleClick
