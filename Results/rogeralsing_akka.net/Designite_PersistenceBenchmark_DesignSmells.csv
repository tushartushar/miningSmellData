Missing Hierarchy,PersistenceBenchmark,PerformanceTestActorBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\benchmark\PersistenceBenchmark\PerformanceActors.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: StopMeasure' FailAt (in method "ControlBehavior" of class "PerformanceTestActorBase").
