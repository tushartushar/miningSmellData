Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PersistenceBenchmark,PerformanceTestException,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\benchmark\PersistenceBenchmark\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Missing Hierarchy,PersistenceBenchmark,PerformanceTestActorBase,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\benchmark\PersistenceBenchmark\PerformanceActors.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: StopMeasure' FailAt (in method "ControlBehavior" of class "PerformanceTestActorBase").
