Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorMemoryFootprintSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorMemoryFootprintSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorPathSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorPathSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorSelectionSpecs,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSelectionSpecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorSelectionSpecs,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSelectionSpecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ActorSelectionSpecs (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSelectionSpecs.cs' [34' 55])' UntypedActorThroughputSpec (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\UntypedActorThroughputSpec.cs' [16' 37])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,TerminatorActor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSystemShutdownSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,AddressSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\AddressSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor.Pattern,AskSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\Pattern\AskSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Dispatch,MailboxMemoryFootprintSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Dispatch\MailboxMemoryFootprintSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Tests.Performance.Util,StandardOutWriterMemoryBenchmark,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Util\StandardOutWriterMemoryBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multipath Hierarchy,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,BenchmarkActor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSelectionSpecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: UntypedActor
Broken Hierarchy,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorSystemShutdown1000Spec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSystemShutdownSpec.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor.ActorSystemShutdownSpec
Broken Hierarchy,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorSystemShutdown20000Spec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSystemShutdownSpec.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor.ActorSystemShutdownSpec
Broken Hierarchy,Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor,ActorSystemShutdown100000Spec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Tests.Performance\Actor\ActorSystemShutdownSpec.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Akka.Tests.Performance.Actor.ActorSystemShutdownSpec
