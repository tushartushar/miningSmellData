Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ClusterDomainEventSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ClusterDomainEventSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ClusterSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ClusterSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: A_cluster_must_publish_initial_state_as_snapshot_to_subscribers which is more interested in members of the type: Cluster
Feature Envy,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ClusterSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ClusterSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: A_cluster_must_publish_member_removed_when_shutdown which is more interested in members of the type: Cluster
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,GossipSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\GossipSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,MemberOrderingSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\MemberOrderingSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ListExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\MemberOrderingSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,MetricsEnabledSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\MetricsCollectorSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Config
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ReachabilitySpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ReachabilitySpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,VectorClockSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\VectorClockSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Akka.Cluster.Tests.Proto,ClusterMessageSerializerSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\Proto\ClusterMessageSerializerSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CheckSerialization which is more interested in members of the type: Serializer
Deficient Encapsulation,Akka.Cluster.Tests.Proto,ClusterMessageSerializerSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\Proto\ClusterMessageSerializerSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Serializer
