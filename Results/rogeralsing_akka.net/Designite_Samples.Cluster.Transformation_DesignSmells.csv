Unnecessary Abstraction,Samples.Cluster.Transformation,TransformationMessages,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Roles\Samples.Cluster.Transformation\TransformationMessages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BACKEND_REGISTRATION
Missing Hierarchy,Samples.Cluster.Transformation,TransformationBackend,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Roles\Samples.Cluster.Transformation\TransformationBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TransformationJob' CurrentClusterState (in method "OnReceive" of class "TransformationBackend").
