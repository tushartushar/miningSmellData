Unexploited Encapsulation,Samples.Cluster.Simple,SimpleClusterListener,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Samples.Cluster.Simple\SimpleClusterListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: UnreachableMember' MemberRemoved (in method "OnReceive" of class "SimpleClusterListener").
Missing Hierarchy,Samples.Cluster.Simple,SimpleClusterListener,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Samples.Cluster.Simple\SimpleClusterListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: UnreachableMember' CurrentClusterState (in method "OnReceive" of class "SimpleClusterListener").
