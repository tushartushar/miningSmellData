Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PersistenceExample,Snap,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\PersistenceExample\AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,PersistenceExample,ExampleView,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\PersistenceExample\ExampleView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SaveSnapshotSuccess' SaveSnapshotFailure (in method "Receive" of class "ExampleView").
Unexploited Encapsulation,PersistenceExample,SnapshotedExampleActor,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\PersistenceExample\SnapshotedExampleActor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SaveSnapshotFailure' SaveSnapshotSuccess (in method "ReceiveCommand" of class "SnapshotedExampleActor").
Missing Hierarchy,PersistenceExample,ExamplePersistentActor,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\PersistenceExample\ExamplePersistentActor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Event' SnapshotOffer (in method "ReceiveRecover" of class "ExamplePersistentActor").
Missing Hierarchy,PersistenceExample,ExampleView,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\PersistenceExample\ExampleView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SnapshotOffer' SaveSnapshotSuccess (in method "Receive" of class "ExampleView").
Missing Hierarchy,PersistenceExample,AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\examples\PersistenceExample\AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Message' Confirmation (in method "ReceiveRecover" of class "AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor").
