(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Akka.Persistence.Sqlite.Journal,SqliteQueryBuilder,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\contrib\persistence\Akka.Persistence.Sqlite\Journal\SqliteQueryBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TimestampRange' PersistenceIdRange (in method "HintToSql" of class "SqliteQueryBuilder").
