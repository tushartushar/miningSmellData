(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Akka.DI.Core,DIExtension,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\contrib\dependencyInjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DIExtensionProvider
Deficient Encapsulation,Akka.DI.Core,DIExtension,C:\repos\rogeralsing_akka.net\src\contrib\dependencyInjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields.
