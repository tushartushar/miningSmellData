Unnecessary Abstraction,NSim,SignalEvent,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\SignalEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,NSim,EventState,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\Contracts\EventState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSim,EventExtensions,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\EventExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSim,FunTimes,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\FunTimes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSim,RandomExtensions,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\RandomExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NSim,ScheduleEmptyException,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\ScheduleEmptyException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NSim,IIncrementallyUpdated,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\IIncrementallyUpdated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IIncrementallyUpdated' SimContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NSim,IResource,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\IResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IResource' RequestEvent
Broken Hierarchy,NSim,SignalEvent,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\SignalEvent.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EventBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,NSim,ContinuousContainerRequestEvent,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\ContinuousContainerRequestEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Schedule
Rebellious Hierarchy,NSim,ProcessCompletionEvent,C:\repos\youknowjack1_nsim\NSim\ProcessCompletionEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Schedule
