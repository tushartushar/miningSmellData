Duplicate Abstraction,MonoTests.Mono.Data.Sqlite,SqliteConnectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mattleibow_Mono.Data.Sqlite\Mono.Data.Sqlite.Tests\store\SqliteConnectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SqliteConnectionTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mattleibow_Mono.Data.Sqlite\Mono.Data.Sqlite.Tests\store\SqliteConnectionTest.cs' [2' 32])' SqliteDataReaderTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mattleibow_Mono.Data.Sqlite\Mono.Data.Sqlite.Tests\store\SqliteDataReaderTest.cs' [2' 32])
Feature Envy,MonoTests.Mono.Data.Sqlite,SqliteConnectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mattleibow_Mono.Data.Sqlite\Mono.Data.Sqlite.Tests\store\SqliteConnectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConnectionStringTest_Empty which is more interested in members of the type: SqliteConnection
