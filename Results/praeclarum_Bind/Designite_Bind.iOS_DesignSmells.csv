Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Praeclarum.Bind,Trigger,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Expression' Member' ChangeAction
Unutilized Abstraction,Praeclarum.Bind,PreserveEventsAndSettersHack,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Praeclarum.Bind,Trigger,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Expression' Member' ChangeAction
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,Binding,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.Binding' Praeclarum.Bind.MultipleBindings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,MemberActions,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.MemberActions' Praeclarum.Bind.Binding
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,MemberActions,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.MemberActions' Praeclarum.Bind.Binding' Praeclarum.Bind.MultipleBindings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,EqualityBinding,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.EqualityBinding' Praeclarum.Bind.Binding
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,EqualityBinding,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.EqualityBinding' Praeclarum.Bind.Binding' Praeclarum.Bind.MultipleBindings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,MultipleBindings,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.MultipleBindings' Praeclarum.Bind.Binding
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Praeclarum.Bind,MultipleBindings,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Praeclarum.Bind.MultipleBindings' Praeclarum.Bind.Binding' Praeclarum.Bind.EqualityBinding
Cyclic Hierarchy,Praeclarum.Bind,Binding,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: EqualityBinding
Cyclic Hierarchy,Praeclarum.Bind,Binding,C:\repos\praeclarum_Bind\src\Bind.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MultipleBindings
