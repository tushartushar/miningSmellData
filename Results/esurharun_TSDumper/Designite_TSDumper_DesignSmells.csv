Duplicate Abstraction,TSDumper,ControlStatus,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\ControlStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ControlStatus[1' 21]' FrequencySelectionControl[1' 21]' INIFile[1' 21]' IUpdateControl[1' 21]' MainWindow[1' 21]' Program[1' 21]' ScriptRunner[1' 21]' TransportStreamAnalyzeControl[1' 21]' ViewLogControl[1' 21]
Unutilized Abstraction,TSDumper,FrequencySelectionControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\FrequencySelectionControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FrequencySelectionControl[1' 22]' MainWindow[1' 22]' Program[1' 22]' TransportStreamAnalyzeControl[1' 22]' ViewLogControl[1' 22]
Duplicate Abstraction,TSDumper,INIFile,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\INIFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: INIFile[1' 23]' ScriptRunner[1' 23]' TransportStreamAnalyzeControl[1' 23]' ViewLogControl[1' 23]
Unutilized Abstraction,TSDumper,IView,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TSDumper,TransportStreamAnalyzeControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\TransportStreamAnalyzeControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,TSDumper,ViewLogControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\ViewLogControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Unutilized Abstraction,TSDumper,ViewLogControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\ViewLogControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TSDumper.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,TSDumper,TransportStreamAnalyzeControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\TransportStreamAnalyzeControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 197
Insufficient Modularization,TSDumper,TransportStreamDumpControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\TransportStreamDumpControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TSDumper,TransportStreamDumpControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\TransportStreamDumpControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Rebellious Hierarchy,TSDumper,ViewLogControl,C:\repos\esurharun_TSDumper\TSDumper\ViewLogControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FindText' FilterText
