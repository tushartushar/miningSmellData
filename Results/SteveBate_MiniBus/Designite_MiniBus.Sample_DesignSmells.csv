Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,MiniBus.Sample,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SteveBate_MiniBus\src\MiniBus.Sample\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ReceiveDemo which is more interested in members of the type: IBus
