Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tasks,TaskExtensions,C:\repos\dschenkelman_async-io-talk\src\AsynchronousPatterns\AsynchronousPatterns\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tasks,Program,C:\repos\dschenkelman_async-io-talk\src\AsynchronousPatterns\AsynchronousPatterns\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ResetEvent
Deficient Encapsulation,Tasks,Program,C:\repos\dschenkelman_async-io-talk\src\AsynchronousPatterns\AsynchronousPatterns\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ResetEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tasks,Program,C:\repos\dschenkelman_async-io-talk\src\AsynchronousPatterns\AsynchronousPatterns\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Program' ProgramWithTasksAndCancellation
