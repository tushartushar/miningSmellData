Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoTest.UI,IListItemBehaviour,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\ListItemBehaviourHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Left' Width' Name' Visible
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoTest.UI,RunFeedback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\RunFeedback.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,AutoTest.UI,RunFeedback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\RunFeedback.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: showDetailsWindow which is more interested in members of the type: TestDetailsForm
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoTest.UI.CodeReflection,TypeConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\CodeReflection\TypeConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AutoTest.UI,RunFeedback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\RunFeedback.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: linkLabelCancelRun' _toolTipProvider' linkLabelErrorDescription' linkLabelTestDetails' linkLabelDebugTest' listViewFeedback' columnType' columnMessage' label1
Deficient Encapsulation,AutoTest.UI,GoToTypeArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\RunFeedback.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Handled
Insufficient Modularization,AutoTest.UI,FeedbackProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\FeedbackProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AutoTest.UI,FeedbackProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\FeedbackProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 62 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AutoTest.UI,FeedbackProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\FeedbackProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AutoTest.UI,ListItemBehaviourHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.UI\ListItemBehaviourHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AutoTest.UI.ListItemBehaviourHandler' AutoTest.UI.FeedbackProvider
