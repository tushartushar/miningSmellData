Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,AutoTest.WinForms,FeedbackForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\FeedbackForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FeedbackFormResize which is more interested in members of the type: RunFeedback
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoTest.WinForms,IInformationForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\IInformationForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Form
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoTest.WinForms,SummaryBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\SummaryBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoTest.WinForms,Arguments,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\ArgumentParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: WatchToken' ConfigurationLocation
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoTest.WinForms.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AutoTest.WinForms,FeedbackForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\FeedbackForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AutoTest.WinForms.FeedbackForm' AutoTest.WinForms.IOverviewForm
Cyclic Hierarchy,AutoTest.WinForms,IOverviewForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.WinForms\IOverviewForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: FeedbackForm
