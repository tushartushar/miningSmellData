Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,LinFu.DynamicProxy,DefaultMethodEmitter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\DefaultMethodEmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: EmitMethodBody
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinFu.DynamicProxy,IProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\Interfaces\IProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Interceptor
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinFu.DynamicProxy,IWithTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\Interfaces\IWithTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Target
Unutilized Abstraction,LinFu.DynamicProxy,IWithTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\Interfaces\IWithTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinFu.DynamicProxy,ProxyDummy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\ProxyDummy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,LinFu.DynamicProxy,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec,ObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\ObjectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,LinFu.DynamicProxy,ProxyCacheEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\ProxyCacheEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BaseType' Interfaces
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LinFu.DynamicProxy,ProxyFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\ProxyFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LinFu.DynamicProxy.ProxyFactory' LinFu.DynamicProxy.ProxyObjectReference
Rebellious Hierarchy,LinFu.DynamicProxy,Interceptor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acken_AutoTest.Net\src\AutoTest.TestRunner\Plugins\AutoTest.TestRunners.MSpec\Interceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Intercept
