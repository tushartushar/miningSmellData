Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Transactions.IO,FileTransaction,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO\FileTransaction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Transactions.IO,FileAdapter,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO\FileAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OpenWrite
