Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests,AsDependentTransaction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\AsDependentTransaction.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Then_DependentTransaction_CanBeCommitted which is more interested in members of the type: ITransactionManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests,Initialization_And_State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\Initialization_And_State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests,Initialization_And_State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\Initialization_And_State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Initialization_And_State (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\Initialization_And_State.cs' [1' 20])' TxFTestFixtureBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\TxFTestFixtureBase.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests,MSDN_Is_Wrong,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\MSDN_Is_Wrong.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests,AsDependentTransaction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\AsDependentTransaction.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests.TxFTestFixtureBase
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests,Initialization_And_State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests\Initialization_And_State.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.Transactions.IO.Tests.TxFTestFixtureBase
