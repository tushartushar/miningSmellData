Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Castle.IO,Castle.IO,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Castle.IO' Castle.IO.FileSystems.Local.Win32.Interop
Unstable Dependency,Castle.IO,Castle.IO,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Castle.IO.Internal' Castle.IO.FileSystems.Local.Win32.Interop
Unstable Dependency,Castle.IO,Castle.IO.Internal,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Castle.IO.FileSystems.Local.Win32.Interop
