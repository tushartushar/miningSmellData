Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Castle.Transactions,Castle.Transactions.Activities,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Castle.Transactions.Activities' Castle.Transactions,Castle.Transactions.Activities.Activity' Castle.Transactions.TransactionManager
Unstable Dependency,Castle.Transactions,Castle.Transactions,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Castle.Transactions.Activities,Castle.Transactions.Activity
Feature Concentration,Castle.Transactions,Castle.Transactions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DefaultTransactionOptions' ITransactionOptions' ITransactionManager' Transaction' TransactionAttribute' TransactionManager' TransactionState' IDependentAware' TransactionMode' IActivityManager' ICreatedTransaction' ITransaction' Maybe]' [TransactionalAttribute]' [IsolationMode]' [ISynchronization]' [CommitResourceException' TransactionException' TransactionalConflictException]' [IRetryPolicy]' [Maybe<T>]' [DisposableScope]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.36,Castle.Transactions.IsolationMode' Castle.Transactions.ISynchronization' Castle.Transactions.IRetryPolicy' Castle.Transactions.Maybe<T>' Castle.Transactions.DisposableScope
Feature Concentration,Castle.Transactions,Castle.Transactions.Contracts,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IDependentAwareContract]' [ICreatedTransactionContract]' [IRetryPolicyContract]' [ITransactionContract]' [ITransactionOptionsContract]' [TransactionManagerContract]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,Castle.Transactions.Contracts.ICreatedTransactionContract' Castle.Transactions.Contracts.IRetryPolicyContract' Castle.Transactions.Contracts.ITransactionContract' Castle.Transactions.Contracts.ITransactionOptionsContract' Castle.Transactions.Contracts.TransactionManagerContract
