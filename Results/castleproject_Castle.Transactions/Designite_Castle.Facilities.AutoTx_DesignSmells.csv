Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,AutoTxFacility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\AutoTxFacility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,ITransactionMetaInfoStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\ITransactionMetaInfoStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ITransactionMetaInfoStore (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\ITransactionMetaInfoStore.cs' [1' 20])' TransactionClassMetaInfoStore (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\TransactionClassMetaInfoStore.cs' [1' 20])' TransactionInterceptor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\TransactionInterceptor.cs' [1' 20])' PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Lifestyles\PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager.cs' [1' 20])' TransactionMetaInfoStoreContract (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Contracts\TransactionMetaInfoStoreContract.cs' [1' 20])' TransactionalClassMetaInfo (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\TransactionalClassMetaInfo.cs' [1' 20])' PerTransactionLifestyleManagerBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Lifestyles\PerTransactionLifestyleManagerBase.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,LifestyleRegistrationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\LifestyleRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,TransactionFacility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Obsolete_Classes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,TransactionFacility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Obsolete_Classes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,TransactionManagerCurrentTransactionSelector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\TransactionManagerCurrentTransactionSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.Lifestyles,PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Lifestyles\PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Lifestyles\PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager.cs' [1' 22])' TransactionMetaInfoStoreContract (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Contracts\TransactionMetaInfoStoreContract.cs' [1' 22])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.Testing,ResolveEx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\Testing\ResolveEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,ITransactionMetaInfoStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\ITransactionMetaInfoStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.ITransactionMetaInfoStore' Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.Contracts.TransactionMetaInfoStoreContract
Cyclic Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.AutoTx,ITransactionMetaInfoStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Facilities.AutoTx\ITransactionMetaInfoStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: TransactionMetaInfoStoreContract
