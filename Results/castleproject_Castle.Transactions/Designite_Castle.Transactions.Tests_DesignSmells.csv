Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Transactions.Tests.TestClasses,ResourceImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TestClasses\ResourceImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ResourceImpl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TestClasses\ResourceImpl.cs' [1' 23])' TestResource (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TestClasses\TestResource.cs' [1' 23])' ThrowsExceptionResourceImpl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TestClasses\ThrowsExceptionResource.cs' [1' 23])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Transactions.Tests.TransactionManager,transaction_manager_spec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TransactionManager\transaction_manager_spec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,Castle.Transactions.Tests.TransactionManager,transaction_manager_spec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TransactionManager\transaction_manager_spec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CurrentTransaction_Same_As_First_Transaction which is more interested in members of the type: ITransactionManager
Feature Envy,Castle.Transactions.Tests.TransactionManager,transaction_manager_spec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TransactionManager\transaction_manager_spec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CurrentTopTransaction_Same_As_First_Transaction which is more interested in members of the type: ITransactionManager
Feature Envy,Castle.Transactions.Tests.TransactionManager,transaction_manager_spec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\TransactionManager\transaction_manager_spec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TopTransaction_AndTransaction_AreDifferent which is more interested in members of the type: ITransactionManager
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Transactions.Tests.ExternalSources,WhoStoleMyTransaction_TestCase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\ExternalSources\WhoStoleMyTransaction_TestCase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Castle.Transactions.Tests.ExternalSources,EnlistmentTracking,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\ExternalSources\WhoStoleMyTransaction_TestCase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EnlistmentCounts
Deficient Encapsulation,Castle.Transactions.Tests.ExternalSources,EnlistmentTracking,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\ExternalSources\WhoStoleMyTransaction_TestCase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: EnlistmentCounts
Deficient Encapsulation,Castle.Transactions.Tests.ExternalSources,AnotherEnlistment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Transactions\src\Castle.Transactions.Tests\ExternalSources\WhoStoleMyTransaction_TestCase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RolledBack
