Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests,Db4oRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Db4oRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests,Db4oTestDataActions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Db4oTestDataActions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateOrderForCustomer which is more interested in members of the type: Db4oTestDataGenerator
Unutilized Abstraction,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests,Db4oUnitOfWorkFactoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Db4oUnitOfWorkFactoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Address,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StreetAddress1' StreetAddress2' City' State' ZipCode
Unnecessary Abstraction,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CustomerID' FirstName' LastName' Address' Orders
Unutilized Abstraction,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Money,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Money.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Product,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Product.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ProductID' Name' Description
Broken Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Address,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StreetAddress1' StreetAddress2' City' State' ZipCode
Broken Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CustomerID' FirstName' LastName' Address' Orders
Broken Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,OrderItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\OrderItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OrderItemID' Order' Product' Quantity' Price' Store' TotalPrice
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests,Db4oTestDataActions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Db4oTestDataActions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Db4oTestDataActions' NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Db4oTestDataGenerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.Customer' NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.Order
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,OrderItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\OrderItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.OrderItem' NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.Order
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\riteshrao_ncommon\NCommon.Db4o\tests\Domain\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.Customer' NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.Order' NCommon.Data.Db4o.Tests.Domain.OrderItem
