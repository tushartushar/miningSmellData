Duplicate Abstraction,BobbyTables,ApiResponse,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\ApiRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ApiResponse (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\ApiRequest.cs' [109' 132])' ApiResponse (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\ApiRequest.cs' [151' 174])
Unnecessary Abstraction,BobbyTables,IgnoreAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\IgnoreAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,BobbyTables,Record,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Record.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unutilized Abstraction,BobbyTables,Record,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Record.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BobbyTables,Row,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Table.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Data' State
Feature Envy,BobbyTables,Transaction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Transaction.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PushAsync which is more interested in members of the type: Datastore
Feature Envy,BobbyTables,Transaction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Transaction.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Push which is more interested in members of the type: Datastore
Unnecessary Abstraction,BobbyTables,PushAsyncContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Transaction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Count' Retries' Success' Failure
Deficient Encapsulation,BobbyTables,Row,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Table.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Data' State
Deficient Encapsulation,BobbyTables,PushAsyncContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Transaction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.

Insufficient Modularization,BobbyTables,DatastoreManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\DatastoreManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BobbyTables,DatastoreManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\DatastoreManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,BobbyTables,Table,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrsharpoblunto_BobbyTables\BobbyTables\Table.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 165
