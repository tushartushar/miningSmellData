Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample,MvcApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Controllers,DefaultController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample\Controllers\DefaultController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Controllers,SystemController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample\Controllers\SystemController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Misc,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample\Misc\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Models,Address,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample\Models\Address.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Details' StreetPrefix
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Models,Contact,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample\Models\Contact.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Models.Contact' ExpressiveAnnotations.MvcWebSample.Models.Query
