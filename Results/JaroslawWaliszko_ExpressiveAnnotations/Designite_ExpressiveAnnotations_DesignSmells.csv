Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.Analysis,Lexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Analysis\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Analyze
Unutilized Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.Functions,ParserHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Functions\Toolchain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExpressiveAnnotations.Attributes,ValueParserAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Attributes\ValueParserAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations.Analysis,Expr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Analysis\Expr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations.Analysis,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Analysis\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations.Analysis,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Analysis\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 149
Broken Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations,FormatItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\MessageFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Uuid' Body' Constant' FieldPath' Indicator' Substitute
Insufficient Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Helper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Helper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ExpressiveAnnotations.Analysis,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaroslawWaliszko_ExpressiveAnnotations\src\ExpressiveAnnotations\Analysis\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExpressiveAnnotations.Analysis.Parser' ExpressiveAnnotations.Functions.IFunctionsProvider
