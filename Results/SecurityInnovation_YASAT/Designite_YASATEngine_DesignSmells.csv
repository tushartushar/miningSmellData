Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,YASATEngine,ProjectInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\ProjectInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,YASATEngine,RuleManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\RuleManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,YASATEngine.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RulesDirectory' LinesBefore' LinesAfter' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,YASATEngine,SourceFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\SourceFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lines' commentedLines' path' issues
Deficient Encapsulation,YASATEngine,ProjectInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\ProjectInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: files
Broken Modularization,YASATEngine.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RulesDirectory' LinesBefore' LinesAfter' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,YASATEngine,Rule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASATEngine\Rule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: YASATEngine.Rule' YASATEngine.SourceCodeIssue
