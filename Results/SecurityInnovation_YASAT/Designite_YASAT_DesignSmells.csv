Duplicate Abstraction,YASAT,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASAT\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASAT\MainWindow.xaml.cs' [189' 214])' MainWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASAT\MainWindow.xaml.cs' [252' 277])
Unnecessary Abstraction,YASAT.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SecurityInnovation_YASAT\YASAT\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
