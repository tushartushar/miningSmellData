Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,VirtualPath,VirtualPathExtensions,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\VirtualPathExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VirtualPath.Common,StringExtensions,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VirtualPath.Common,VirtualPathExtension,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\VirtualPathExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,VirtualPath.InMemory,InMemoryVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\InMemory\InMemoryVirtualPathProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetEnumerator
Deficient Encapsulation,VirtualPath.InMemory,InMemoryVirtualPathProvider,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\InMemory\InMemoryVirtualPathProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rootDirectory
Deficient Encapsulation,VirtualPath.InMemory,InMemoryVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\InMemory\InMemoryVirtualPathProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: files' dirs
Insufficient Modularization,VirtualPath.Common,AbstractVirtualDirectoryBase,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\AbstractVirtualDirectoryBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,VirtualPath.Common,AbstractVirtualDirectoryBase,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\AbstractVirtualDirectoryBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,VirtualPath.Common,AbstractVirtualFileBase,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\AbstractVirtualFileBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,VirtualPath.Common,AbstractVirtualFileBase,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\AbstractVirtualFileBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.FileSystem,FileSystemVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\FileSystem\FileSystemVirtualDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FileSystemVirtualDirectory' FileSystemVirtualFile
Rebellious Hierarchy,VirtualPath.Common,AbstractVirtualFileBase,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\Common\AbstractVirtualFileBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OpenWrite' OpenRead
Broken Hierarchy,VirtualPath.FileSystem,FileSystemVirtualPathProvider,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath\FileSystem\FileSystemVirtualPathProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractVirtualPathProviderBase
