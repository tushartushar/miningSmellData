Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetEnumerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DropboxVirtualDirectory' DropboxVirtualPathProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DropboxVirtualDirectory' DropboxVirtualPathProvider' DropboxVirtualFile
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualFile,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DropboxVirtualFile' DropboxVirtualDirectory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualFile,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DropboxVirtualFile' DropboxVirtualDirectory' DropboxVirtualPathProvider' DropboxVirtualDirectory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualFile,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DropboxVirtualFile' DropboxVirtualDirectory' DropboxVirtualPathProvider' DropboxVirtualDirectory' DropboxVirtualPathProvider
Broken Hierarchy,VirtualPath.DropNet,DropboxVirtualPathProvider,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.DropNet\DropboxVirtualPathProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractVirtualPathProviderBase
