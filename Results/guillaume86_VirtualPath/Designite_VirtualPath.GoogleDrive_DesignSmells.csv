Unutilized Abstraction,Google.Apis.Samples.Helper,AuthorizationMgr,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.GoogleDrive\AuthorizationMgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VirtualPath.GoogleDrive,DriveCommandLineSample,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.GoogleDrive\DriveCommandLineSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Google.Apis.Samples.Helper,AppData,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.GoogleDrive\AppData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ApplicationName
Deficient Encapsulation,Google.Apis.Samples.Helper,AppData,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.GoogleDrive\AppData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ApplicationName
Broken Hierarchy,VirtualPath.GoogleDrive,DriveVirtualPathProvider,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.GoogleDrive\DriveVirtualPathProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractVirtualPathProviderBase
Missing Hierarchy,Google.Apis.Samples.Helper.Forms,OAuth2AuthorizationDialog,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.GoogleDrive\Forms\OAuth2AuthorizationDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: OAuth2IntroPanel' OAuth2CodePanel (in method "bNext_Click" of class "OAuth2AuthorizationDialog").
