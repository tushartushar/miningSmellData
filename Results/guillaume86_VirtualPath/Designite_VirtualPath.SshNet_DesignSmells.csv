Unexloited Encapsulation,VirtualPath.SshNet,SftpVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.SshNet\SftpVirtualDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IVirtualFile' IVirtualDirectory (in method "DeleteBackingDirectoryOrFile" of class "SftpVirtualDirectory").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtualPath.SshNet,SftpVirtualDirectory,C:\repos\guillaume86_VirtualPath\VirtualPath.SshNet\SftpVirtualDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SftpVirtualDirectory' SftpVirtualFile
