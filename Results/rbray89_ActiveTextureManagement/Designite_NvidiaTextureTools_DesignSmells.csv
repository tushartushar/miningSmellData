Unutilized Abstraction,NvidiaTextureTools,ColorExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rbray89_ActiveTextureManagement\NvidiaTextureTools\Color16.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NvidiaTextureTools,ColorArray,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rbray89_ActiveTextureManagement\NvidiaTextureTools\ColorBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Array' m_color
