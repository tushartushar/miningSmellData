Unutilized Abstraction,NamePatcher,NamePatcher,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\NamePatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NamePatcher,HelperClass,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\HelperClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,NamePatcher,NameNormalizer,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\NameNormalizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: vmethid' classid' vclasses' clnamestomod
Deficient Encapsulation,NamePatcher,NameNormalizer,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\NameNormalizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: vmethid' classid' vclasses' clnamestomod
Insufficient Modularization,NamePatcher,HelperClass,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\HelperClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NamePatcher,HelperClass,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\HelperClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NamePatcher,HelperClass,F:\newReposMay17\DerPopo_deobfuscate-7dtd\NamePatcher\HelperClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
