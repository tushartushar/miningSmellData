Unnecessary Abstraction,MonoDevelop.MeeGo,MeeGoExecutionModeSet,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.MeeGo\MeeGoExecutionModeSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' ExecutionModes' mode
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoDevelop.MeeGo,MeeGoExecutionModeSet,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.MeeGo\MeeGoExecutionModeSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MonoDevelop.MeeGo,MeeGoExecutionMode,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.MeeGo\MeeGoExecutionModeSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Id' ExecutionHandler' handler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoDevelop.MeeGo,MeeGoDevice,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.MeeGo\MeeGoUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MeeGoDevice' MeeGoDevicePicker
Rebellious Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.MeeGo,TextStream,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.MeeGo\MeeGoExecutionHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
