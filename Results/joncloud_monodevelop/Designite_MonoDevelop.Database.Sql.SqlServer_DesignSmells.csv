Insufficient Modularization,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerSchemaProvider,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\SqlServerSchemaProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerSchemaProvider,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\SqlServerSchemaProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerSchemaProvider,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\SqlServerSchemaProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 372
Insufficient Modularization,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerDialect,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\SqlServerDialect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 195
Rebellious Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerSchemaProvider,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\SqlServerSchemaProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateView' CreateIndex' AlterDatabase' AlterTable' AlterView' AlterIndex' AlterTrigger' AlterUser
Broken Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerCollationSchemaCollection,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\Collections\SqlServerCollationSchemaCollection.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SortedCollectionBase
Broken Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer,SqlServerDatabaseSchema,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\MonoDevelop.Database\MonoDevelop.Database.Sql.SqlServer\Schema\SqlServerDatabaseSchema.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DatabaseSchema
