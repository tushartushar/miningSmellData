Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoDevelop.Xml.Formatting,XmlFormatterWriter,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.Formatting\XmlFormatterWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: XmlFormatterWriter' TextWriterWrapper
Missing Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.XmlEditor.Gui,BaseXmlEditorExtension,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor.Gui\BaseXmlEditorExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: XmlFreeState' IAttributedXObject (in method "HandleCodeCompletion" of class "BaseXmlEditorExtension").
Missing Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.XmlEditor.Gui,BaseXmlEditorExtension,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor.Gui\BaseXmlEditorExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: XmlNameState' INamedXObject (in method "GetCurrentPath" of class "BaseXmlEditorExtension").
Wide Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine,State,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine\State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AspNetExpressionState' AspNetDirectiveState' HtmlScriptBodyState' RazorState' RootState' XmlCDataState' XmlAttributeState' XmlAttributeValueState' XmlClosingTagState' XmlCommentState' XmlNameState' XmlTagState' XmlProcessingInstructionState' XmlDocTypeState
Broken Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine,RootState,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine\State.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): State
Unfactored Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine,XmlCDataState,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine\XmlCDataState.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XmlCDataState[3' 34]' XmlCommentState[3' 34]
Unfactored Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine,XmlAttributeState,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine\XmlAttributeState.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XmlAttributeState[3' 36]' XmlNameState[3' 36]
Wide Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine,XNode,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine\XDom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AspNetDirective' AspNetExpression' AspNetServerComment' AspNetRenderBlock' RazorExpression' RazorComment' XContainer' XCData' XComment' XProcessingInstruction' XDocType' XClosingTag
Broken Hierarchy,MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine,XNode,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDevelop.XmlEditor\MonoDevelop.Xml.StateEngine\XDom.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XObject
