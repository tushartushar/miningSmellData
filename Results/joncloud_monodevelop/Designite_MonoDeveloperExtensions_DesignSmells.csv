Duplicate Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefile,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: MonoMakefile[3' 30]' MonoMakefileFormat[3' 30]

Unutilized Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,Commands,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,InstallHandler,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefileFormat,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MonoMakefileFormat' MonoSolutionItemHandler
