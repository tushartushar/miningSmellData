Duplicate Abstraction,JavaBinding,ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\Gui\ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel[2' 21]' JavaCompilerParameters[2' 21]' JavaLanguageBinding[2' 21]
Unutilized Abstraction,JavaBinding,GlobalOptionsPanelPanel,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\Gui\GlobalOptionsPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,JavaBinding,GlobalProperties,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\JavaLanguageBinding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IkvmPath' CompilerCommand' CompilerType' Classpath' props
Imperative Abstraction,JavaBinding,IKVMCompilerManager,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\IKVMCompilerManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Compile
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,Gui,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,BinContainer,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,ActionGroups,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JavaBinding,ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\Gui\ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel' CodeGenerationPanelWidget
Broken Modularization,JavaBinding,GlobalProperties,C:\repos\joncloud_monodevelop\extras\JavaBinding\JavaLanguageBinding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IkvmPath' CompilerCommand' CompilerType' Classpath' props
