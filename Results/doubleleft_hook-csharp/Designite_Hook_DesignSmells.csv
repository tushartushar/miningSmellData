Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Hook,Collection,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Unutilized Abstraction,Hook,KeyValue,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\KeyValue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Hook,Model,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Hook,Client,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: System' Auth
Deficient Encapsulation,Hook,Request,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: client' request
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,Client,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Client' System
Insufficient Modularization,Hook,Collection,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Hook,Collection,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,Collection,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Collection' Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,Collection,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Collection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Collection' Client' System' Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,Auth,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Auth.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Auth' Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,Auth,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Auth.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Auth' Client' System' Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,WebSocket,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Channel\WebSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebSocket' Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hook,WebSocket,C:\repos\doubleleft_hook-csharp\Hook\Channel\WebSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebSocket' Client' System' Client
