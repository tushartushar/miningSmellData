Insufficient Modularization,Facts.DiffPlex,BuildDiffModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mmanela_diffplex\Facts.DiffPlex\InlineDiffBuilderFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Facts.DiffPlex,TestableDiffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mmanela_diffplex\Facts.DiffPlex\DifferFacts.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DiffPlex.Differ
