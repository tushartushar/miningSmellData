Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,AdvancedCachingPage,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\AdvancedCachingPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,AdvancedCachingPage,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\AdvancedCachingPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,AdvancedCachingPage,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\AdvancedCachingPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AdvancedCachingPage[60' 108]' SimpleCachingPage[53' 101]
Unnecessary Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,LocalizedStrings,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\LocalizedStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LocalizedResources' _localizedResources
Unutilized Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,LocalizedStrings,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\LocalizedStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,SimpleCachingPage,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\SimpleCachingPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp,SimpleCachingPage,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\SimpleCachingPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp.Common,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\Common\Md5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: MD5CryptoServiceProvider[528' 548]' MD5CryptoServiceProvider[563' 583]
Multifaceted Abstraction,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp.Common,MD5,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\Common\Md5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Broken Hierarchy,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp.Common,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\Common\Md5.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MD5
Cyclic Hierarchy,PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp.Common,MD5,C:\repos\davidturneruk_PCLCache\PCLCache\PCLCache.SamplePhoneApp\Common\Md5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MD5CryptoServiceProvider
