Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,NVorbis,BufferedReadStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\BufferedReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: NVorbis.BufferedReadStream' TestHarness.BufferedReadStream
Feature Envy,NVorbis,StreamReadBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\StreamReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PrepareStreamForRead which is more interested in members of the type: StreamWrapper
Unnecessary Abstraction,NVorbis,StreamWrapper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\StreamReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Source' LockObject' EofOffset' RefCount
Unnecessary Abstraction,NVorbis,SavedBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\StreamReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Buffer' BaseOffset' End' DiscardCount' VersionSaved
Unutilized Abstraction,TestHarness,BufferedReadStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\TestHarness\BufferedReadStreamWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NVorbis,SavedBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\StreamReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Buffer' BaseOffset' End' DiscardCount' VersionSaved
Broken Modularization,NVorbis,SavedBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\StreamReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Buffer' BaseOffset' End' DiscardCount' VersionSaved
Rebellious Hierarchy,NVorbis,BufferedReadStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\renaudbedard_nvorbis\NVorbis\BufferedReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' SetLength' Write
