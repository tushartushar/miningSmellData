Insufficient Modularization,Grean.AtomEventStore,AtomLink,C:\repos\GreanTech_AtomEventStore\AtomEventStore\AtomLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,Grean.AtomEventStore,AtomEntry,C:\repos\GreanTech_AtomEventStore\AtomEventStore\AtomEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
