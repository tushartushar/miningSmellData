Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DataAccess,DataTableAzureExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\AzureDataTableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataAccess,AzureRow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\AzureStreamingTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ColumnNames' Values' _parent' _values
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataAccess,GenericEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PartitionKey' RowKey' properties
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataAccess,GenericWriterEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _source
Imperative Abstraction,DataAccess,GenericTableWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SaveToAzureTable
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess,AzureStreamingTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\AzureStreamingTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _tableClient' _tableName' _columnNames
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess,AzureRow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\AzureStreamingTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _parent' _values
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess,GenericEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: properties
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess,GenericTableReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AtomNamespace' DataNamespace' MetadataNamespace
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess,GenericTableReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AtomNamespace' DataNamespace' MetadataNamespace
Deficient Encapsulation,DataAccess,GenericWriterEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\GenericTableWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _source
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataAccess,AzureStreamingTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikeStall_DataTable\Sources\CsvReader.Azure\AzureStreamingTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataAccess.AzureStreamingTable' DataAccess.AzureRow
