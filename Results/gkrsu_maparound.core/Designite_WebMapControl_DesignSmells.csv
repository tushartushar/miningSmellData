List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WebCacheAccessor (C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\Caching.cs' [1' 20])' LegendImageHandler (C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\LegendImageHandler.cs' [1' 20])' NamespaceDoc (C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs' [1' 20])' MapImageHandler (C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapImageHandler.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,LegendImageHandler,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\LegendImageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,NamespaceDoc,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,NamespaceDoc,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,MapControl,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,FeatureSelectedEventArgs,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,FeaturePostEventArgs,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
