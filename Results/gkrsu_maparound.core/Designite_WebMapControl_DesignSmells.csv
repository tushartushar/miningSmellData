Imperative Abstraction,MapAround.Caching,WebCacheAccessor,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\Caching.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Clear
Duplicate Abstraction,MapAround.Caching,WebCacheAccessor,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\Caching.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: WebCacheAccessor[1' 20]' LegendImageHandler[1' 20]' NamespaceDoc[1' 20]' MapImageHandler[1' 20]
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,LegendImageHandler,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\LegendImageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,NamespaceDoc,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,NamespaceDoc,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,MapControl,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,FeatureSelectedEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,FeaturePostEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapAround.UI.Web,MapImageHandler,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapImageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MapAround.UI.Web,MapControl,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MapAround.UI.Web,MapControl,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 142
Rebellious Hierarchy,MapAround.UI.Web,MapControl,F:\newReposMay17\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WebMapControl\MapControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnLoad
