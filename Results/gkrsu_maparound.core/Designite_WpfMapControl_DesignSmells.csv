Multifaceted Abstraction,WpfMapControl,MapControl,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,WpfMapControl,MapControl,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,WpfMapControl.Properties,Resources,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Resources[1' 32]' Settings[1' 32]
Unnecessary Abstraction,WpfMapControl.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
