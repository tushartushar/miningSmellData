Unutilized Abstraction,WpfMapControl,MapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,WpfMapControl,MapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnSizeChanged which is more interested in members of the type: BoundingRectangle

Unnecessary Abstraction,WpfMapControl,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,WpfMapControl,MapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WpfMapControl,MapControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gkrsu_maparound.core\src\WpfMapControl\MapControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 119
