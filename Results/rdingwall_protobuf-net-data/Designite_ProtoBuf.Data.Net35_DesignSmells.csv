(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,CircularBuffer<T>,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\CircularBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CircularBuffer<T> (C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\CircularBuffer.cs' [1' 28])' CircularStream (C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\CircularStream.cs' [1' 28])
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,CircularStream,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\CircularStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Imperative Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,RowWriter,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\RowWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: WriteRow
Deficient Encapsulation,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,ProtoDataColumn,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\ProtoDataColumn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ProtoDataType' ColumnName' ColumnIndex
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataReader,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\ProtoDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataReader,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\ProtoDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataStream,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\ProtoDataStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,CircularStream,C:\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\ProtoBuf.Data\Internal\CircularStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength
