Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data,DataSerializer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\DataSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\ProtoDataStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,CircularBuffer<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\CircularBuffer`1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CircularBuffer<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\CircularBuffer`1.cs' [1' 30])' CircularStream (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\CircularStream.cs' [1' 30])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,RecordReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\RecordReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ReadRecord
Imperative Abstraction,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,RecordWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\RecordWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: WriteRecord
Deficient Encapsulation,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,ValueTypeBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\ProtoDataBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Boolean' Byte' Char' DateTime' Decimal' Double' Float' Guid' Int32' Int64' Int16' TimeSpan
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\ProtoDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\ProtoDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Broken Modularization,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,ValueTypeBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\ProtoDataBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Boolean' Byte' Char' DateTime' Decimal' Double' Float' Guid' Int32' Int64' Int16' TimeSpan
Rebellious Hierarchy,ProtoBuf.Data,ProtoDataStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\ProtoDataStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,ProtoBuf.Data.Internal,CircularStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rdingwall_protobuf-net-data\src\protobuf-net-data\Internal\CircularStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength
