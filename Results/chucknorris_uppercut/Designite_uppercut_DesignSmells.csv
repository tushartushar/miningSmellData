Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut,EnumerableExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\EnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut,Iteration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\Iteration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut,TypeCasting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\TypeCasting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut.infrastructure.console,CommandRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\infrastructure\console\CommandRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut.template.builder,TemplateBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\template.builder\TemplateBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,uppercut.template.builder,TemplateBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\template.builder\TemplateBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: report_settings_files which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystemAccess
Feature Envy,uppercut.template.builder,TemplateBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\template.builder\TemplateBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: copy_file which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystemAccess
Unnecessary Abstraction,uppercut.infrastructure,ApplicationParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\infrastructure\ApplicationParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name
Unutilized Abstraction,uppercut.infrastructure,ApplicationParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\infrastructure\ApplicationParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,uppercut.infrastructure,ApplicationParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\infrastructure\ApplicationParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name
Deficient Encapsulation,uppercut.infrastructure,ApplicationParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\infrastructure\ApplicationParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: name
Insufficient Modularization,uppercut.infrastructure.filesystem,WindowsFileSystemAccess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chucknorris_uppercut\product\uppercut\infrastructure\filesystem\WindowsFileSystemAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
