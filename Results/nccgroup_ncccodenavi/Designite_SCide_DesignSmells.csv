Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,SCide,DocumentForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\DocumentForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExportAsHtml which is more interested in members of the type: Scintilla
Feature Envy,SCide,DocumentForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\DocumentForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Save which is more interested in members of the type: Scintilla
Unnecessary Abstraction,SCide.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,SCide,MainForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 71 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SCide,MainForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 117
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SCide,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SCide.Program' SCide.MainForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SCide,DocumentForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nccgroup_ncccodenavi\Win.CodeNavi\3rd-Party\ScintillaNET v2.5.2 Source\SCide\DocumentForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SCide.DocumentForm' SCide.MainForm' SCide.Program
