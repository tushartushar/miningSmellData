Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,AbstractLogger,C:\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\AbstractLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,AbstractLogger,C:\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\AbstractLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,Routing,C:\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Routing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuartzNetWebConsole.Routing' QuartzNetWebConsole.Setup
