Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,QuartzNetWebConsole,EnumerableExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\EnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,Owin,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\Owin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,AbstractLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\AbstractLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,AbstractLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\AbstractLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,ISchedulerWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\ISchedulerWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,SchedulerWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\SchedulerWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,SchedulerWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\SchedulerWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,Routing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Routing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuartzNetWebConsole.Routing' QuartzNetWebConsole.Setup
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QuartzNetWebConsole,Routing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Routing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QuartzNetWebConsole.Routing' QuartzNetWebConsole.Setup' QuartzNetWebConsole.Controllers.LogController
Rebellious Hierarchy,QuartzNetWebConsole,AbstractLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\AbstractLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Add
Cyclic Hierarchy,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,Response,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\Response.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ContentResponse
Cyclic Hierarchy,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,Response,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\Response.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: XDocumentResponse
Cyclic Hierarchy,QuartzNetWebConsole.Utils,Response,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_QuartzNetWebConsole\QuartzNetWebConsole\Utils\Response.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: RedirectResponse
