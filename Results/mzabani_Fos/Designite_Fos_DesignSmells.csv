Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Fos.Owin,PageNotFoundMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Middleware\PageNotFoundMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fos.Owin,ExtensionMethods,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Owin\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Fos.CustomPages,ICustomPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\CustomPages\ICustomPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Contents
Imperative Abstraction,Fos.Listener,FosRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Listener\FosRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessRequest
Unutilized Abstraction,Fos.Listener,RecordFactoryAndRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Listener\RecordFactoryAndRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Fos.Logging,StatsPageMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Logging\StatsLogging\StatsPageMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Invoke
Duplicate Abstraction,Fos.Streams,FosStdoutStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Streams\FosStdoutStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FosStdoutStream (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Streams\FosStdoutStream.cs' [35' 62])' NonEndingStdoutSocketStream (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Streams\NonEndingStdoutSocketStream.cs' [24' 51])
Deficient Encapsulation,Fos.Owin,OwinMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Middleware\OwinMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Next
Deficient Encapsulation,Fos.Owin,FosOwinRoot,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Middleware\FosOwinRoot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Next
Deficient Encapsulation,Fos,FosSelfHost,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\FosSelfHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FlushPeriodically
Deficient Encapsulation,Fos.Listener,FosRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Listener\FosRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FlushPeriodically' ApplicationPipelineEntry
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Fos.Listener,FosRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Listener\FosRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Fos.Listener.FosRequest' Fos.Logging.RequestInfo
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Fos.Listener,FosRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Listener\FosRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Fos.Listener.FosRequest' Fos.Logging.RequestInfo' Fos.Logging.IServerLogger
Rebellious Hierarchy,Fos.Logging,StatsLogger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mzabani_Fos\Fos\Logging\StatsLogging\StatsLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LogSocketError
