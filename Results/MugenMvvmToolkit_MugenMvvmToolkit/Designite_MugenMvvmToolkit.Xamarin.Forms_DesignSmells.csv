Imperative Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure.Callbacks,AwaiterSerializableCallback,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\mugenmvvmtoolkit.android\infrastructure\callbacks\SerializableOperationCallbackFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Invoke
Unnecessary Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure.Callbacks,IHasStateMachine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\mugenmvvmtoolkit.android\infrastructure\callbacks\SerializableOperationCallbackFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StateMachine
Imperative Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure.Callbacks,DelegateSerializableCallback,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\mugenmvvmtoolkit.android\infrastructure\callbacks\SerializableOperationCallbackFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Invoke
Imperative Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure,XamarinFormsBootstrapperBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\Infrastructure\XamarinFormsBootstrapperBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Unnecessary Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Interfaces.Views,IModalView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\Interfaces\Views\IModalView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Interfaces.Views,ITabView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\Interfaces\Views\IModalView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms,MvvmXamarinApplicationBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\MvvmXamarinApplicationBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure.Presenters,ViewModelState,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\Infrastructure\Presenters\RestorableViewModelPresenter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Index' State
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure,XamarinFormsBootstrapperBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\Infrastructure\XamarinFormsBootstrapperBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure.XamarinFormsBootstrapperBase' MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure.Presenters.XamarinFormsRootDynamicViewModelPresenter
Rebellious Hierarchy,MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms.Infrastructure,XamarinFormsDesignBootstrapperBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.Xamarin.Forms\Infrastructure\XamarinFormsDesignBootstrapperBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start
