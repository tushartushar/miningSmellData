Duplicate Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding.Converters,BooleanToVisibilityConverter,C:\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding\Converters\BooleanToVisibilityConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BooleanToVisibilityConverter (C:\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding\Converters\BooleanToVisibilityConverter.cs' [5' 24])' NullToVisibilityConverter (C:\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding\Converters\NullToVisibilityConverter.cs' [5' 24])
Unutilized Abstraction,MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding.Converters,NullToVisibilityConverter,C:\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding\Converters\NullToVisibilityConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,MugenMvvmToolkit.UWP.Binding.Models,ParentObserver,C:\repos\MugenMvvmToolkit_MugenMvvmToolkit\Platforms\MugenMvvmToolkit.WPF.Binding(4.5)\Models\ParentObserver.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MugenMvvmToolkit.Binding.Infrastructure.EventListenerList
