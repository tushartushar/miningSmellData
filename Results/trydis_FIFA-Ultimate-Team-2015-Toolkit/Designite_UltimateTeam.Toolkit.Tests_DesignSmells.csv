Unutilized Abstraction,UltimateTeam.Toolkit.Tests,FutClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\trydis_FIFA-Ultimate-Team-2015-Toolkit\UltimateTeam.Toolkit.Tests\FutClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,UltimateTeam.Toolkit.Tests,FutClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\trydis_FIFA-Ultimate-Team-2015-Toolkit\UltimateTeam.Toolkit.Tests\FutClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoginAsync_WhenCalled_ShouldPerformRequest which is more interested in members of the type: IFutClient
