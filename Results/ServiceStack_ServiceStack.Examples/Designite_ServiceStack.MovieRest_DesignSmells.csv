Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.MovieRest,ResetMovies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\ResetMovies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.MovieRest,MovieResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\MovieService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Movie

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Genre
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.MovieRest,MoviesResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\MovieService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Movies
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.MovieRest,Global,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.MovieRest,ResetMoviesService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\ResetMovies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Top5Movies
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.MovieRest,ResetMoviesService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\ResetMovies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Top5Movies
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.MovieRest,Movie,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Examples\src\ServiceStack.MovieRest\Web\MovieService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.MovieRest.Movie' ServiceStack.MovieRest.MovieResponse
