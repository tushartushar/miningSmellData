Duplicate Abstraction,TrafficLightDemo,DelegateScheduler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_StateMachineToolkit\tests\TrafficLightDemo\DelegateScheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DelegateScheduler (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_StateMachineToolkit\tests\TrafficLightDemo\DelegateScheduler.cs' [1' 35])' Task (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_StateMachineToolkit\tests\TrafficLightDemo\DelegateScheduler.Task.cs' [1' 35])
Feature Envy,TrafficLightDemo,TrafficLight,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_StateMachineToolkit\tests\TrafficLightDemo\TrafficLight.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: EntryOff which is more interested in members of the type: DelegateScheduler
