Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.33  All the dependencies among components: from: MigSharp.SqlServer.NUnit' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.SqlServer.NUnit' to: MigSharp.Generate' from: MigSharp.SQLite.NUnit' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Oracle.NUnit' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Oracle.NUnit' to: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration' from: MigSharp.Generate' to: MigSharp.Generate.Util' from: MigSharp.Generate' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Generate' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp.Generate' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.Generate' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.Generate' to: MigSharp.Core.Entities' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Core' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Core' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Core' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.NUnit' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.NUnit' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp.NUnit' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration' to: MigSharp.NUnit.Migrate' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Migrate' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Migrate' to: MigSharp.Generate' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Migrate' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Migrate' to: MigSharp.Migrate' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Migrate' to: MigSharp.Migrate.Util' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Process' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Process' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Process' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Process' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Providers' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.NUnit.Providers' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Core' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Core' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.Core.Commands' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.Core.Commands' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Core.Commands' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.Core.Commands' to: MigSharp.Core.Entities' from: MigSharp.Core.Entities' to: MigSharp.Core.Commands' from: MigSharp.Core.Entities' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Core.Entities' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.Process' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Process' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.Process' to: MigSharp.Providers' from: MigSharp.Providers' to: MigSharp.Core' from: MigSharp.Providers' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Providers' to: MigSharp.Process' from: MigSharp.Migrate' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Migrate' to: MigSharp.Migrate.Util' from: MigSharp.MySql.NUnit' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Teradata.NUnit' to: MigSharp' from: MigSharp.Teradata.NUnit' to: MigSharp.NUnit.Integration.
