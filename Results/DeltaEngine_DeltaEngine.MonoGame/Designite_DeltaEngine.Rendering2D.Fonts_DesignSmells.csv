Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,FontText,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\FontText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Set
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,GlyphDrawData,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\GlyphDrawData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DrawArea' UV
Imperative Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,TextConverter,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\TextConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetRenderableGlyphs
Multifaceted Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,TextWrapper,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\TextWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Unutilized Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,VectorCharacterLines,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\VectorCharacterLines.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,Glyph,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\Glyph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UV' AdvanceWidth' LeftSideBearing' RightSideBearing' PrecomputedFontMapUV
Deficient Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,GlyphDrawData,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\GlyphDrawData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DrawArea' UV
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,FontRenderer,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\FontRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FontRenderer' FontText
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,FontText,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\FontText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FontText' Console' Logger' Font
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,FontText,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\FontText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FontText' Console' Logger' Image' Material
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,Font,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\Font.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Font' Console' Logger
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,Font,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\Font.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Font' Console' Logger' Image' Material
Broken Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,Glyph,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\Glyph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UV' AdvanceWidth' LeftSideBearing' RightSideBearing' Kernings' PrecomputedFontMapUV
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,Font,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\Font.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DisposeData
Broken Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Fonts,VectorText,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.MonoGame\Rendering2D\Fonts\VectorText.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Entity2D
