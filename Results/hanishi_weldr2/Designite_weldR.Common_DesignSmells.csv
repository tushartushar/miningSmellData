Unutilized Abstraction,weldR.Common.Rx,FileSystemInfoReactiveExtensions,C:\repos\hanishi_weldr2\src\weldR.Common\Rx\FileSystemInfoReactiveExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,weldR.Common.Rx,PipeStreamObservable,C:\repos\hanishi_weldr2\src\weldR.Common\Rx\PipeStreamObservable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PipeStreamObservable[53' 81]' PipeStreamObservable[102' 130]
Unutilized Abstraction,weldR.Common.Rx,UserLogonObservable,C:\repos\hanishi_weldr2\src\weldR.Common\Rx\UserLogonObservable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,weldR.Common.Util.Text,Label,C:\repos\hanishi_weldr2\src\weldR.Common\Util\Text\Label.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' Children
Unutilized Abstraction,weldR.Common.Util.Text,LabelExtensions,C:\repos\hanishi_weldr2\src\weldR.Common\Util\Text\LabelExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
