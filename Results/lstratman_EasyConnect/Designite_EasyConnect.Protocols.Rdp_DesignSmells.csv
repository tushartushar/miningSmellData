Imperative Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.Rdp,RdpConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\Rdp\RdpConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetObjectData
Imperative Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.Rdp,RdpConnectionForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\Rdp\RdpConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Connect
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.Rdp,RdpProtocol,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\Rdp\RdpProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ProtocolPrefix' ProtocolTitle' ProtocolIcon
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols.Rdp,RdpOptionsForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\Rdp\RdpOptionsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EasyConnect.Protocols.Rdp.RdpOptionsForm' EasyConnect.Protocols.Rdp.RdpProtocol
