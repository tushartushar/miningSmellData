Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellConnection,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetObjectData
Duplicate Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellConnectionForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PowerShellConnectionForm[484' 510]' PowerShellOptionsForm[216' 242]
Unutilized Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellOptionsForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellOptionsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellProtocol,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ProtocolPrefix' ProtocolTitle' ProtocolIcon
Deficient Encapsulation,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellHost,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PushedRunspace
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellConnectionForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PowerShellConnectionForm' PowerShellHost
Insufficient Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellHostUi,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellHostUi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellHostUi,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellHostUi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
Rebellious Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellHost,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: EnterNestedPrompt' NotifyBeginApplication' NotifyEndApplication
Rebellious Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellHostUi,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellHostUi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PromptForCredential' PromptForCredential' ReadLineAsSecureString
Broken Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellProtocol,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellProtocol.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseProtocol
Rebellious Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,PowerShellRawUi,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\PowerShellRawUi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FlushInputBuffer' GetBufferContents' ScrollBufferContents' SetBufferContents
Rebellious Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols.PowerShell,StreamConnection,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\PowerShell\StreamConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Reproduce' RepeatAsyncRead
