Imperative Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\AbstractBaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Connect
Duplicate Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnection,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BaseConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BaseConnection[124' 165]' BookmarksFolder[91' 132]
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,IOptionsForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\IOptionsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Connection' DefaultsMode' Connection
Unutilized Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,IOptionsForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\IOptionsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols,BookmarksFolder,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BookmarksFolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BookmarksFolder' IConnection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols,BookmarksFolder,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BookmarksFolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BookmarksFolder' IConnection' ConnectionFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols,BookmarksFolder,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BookmarksFolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BookmarksFolder' IConnection' IProtocol' ConnectionFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyConnect.Protocols,ConnectionFactory,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\ConnectionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ConnectionFactory' BookmarksFolder' IConnection' BookmarksFolder' IConnection
Rebellious Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm,F:\newReposMay17\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\AbstractBaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect
