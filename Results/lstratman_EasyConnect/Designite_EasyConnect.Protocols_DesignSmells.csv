Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm<T>,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\AbstractBaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Connection
Duplicate Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnection,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BaseConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BaseConnection (C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BaseConnection.cs' [126' 167])' BookmarksFolder (C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BookmarksFolder.cs' [97' 138])
Imperative Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Connect
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyConnect.Protocols,IOptionsForm,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\IOptionsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Connection' DefaultsMode' Connection
Multipath Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm<T>,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\AbstractBaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IConnectionForm
Broken Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm<T>,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\AbstractBaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EasyConnect.Protocols.BaseConnectionForm' EasyConnect.Protocols.IConnectionForm
Rebellious Hierarchy,EasyConnect.Protocols,BaseConnectionForm,C:\repos\lstratman_EasyConnect\Protocols\BaseConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect
