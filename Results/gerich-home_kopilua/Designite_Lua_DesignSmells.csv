Unutilized Abstraction,KopiLua,InstructionPtr,C:\repos\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lcode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KopiLua,FilePtr,C:\repos\gerich-home_kopilua\src\liolib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' file

Insufficient Modularization,KopiLua,Lua,C:\repos\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 75 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,KopiLua,Lua,C:\repos\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 81 methods
Insufficient Modularization,KopiLua,Lua,C:\repos\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 185
Insufficient Modularization,AT.MIN,Tools,C:\repos\gerich-home_kopilua\src\printf\Tools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 177
