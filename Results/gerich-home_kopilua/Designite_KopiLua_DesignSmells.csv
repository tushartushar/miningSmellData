Unutilized Abstraction,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Lua[2530' 3443]' InstructionPtr[1' 914]
Duplicate Abstraction,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Unnecessary Abstraction,KopiLua,FilePtr,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\liolib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' file

Deficient Encapsulation,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: maskmarks' KEYWEAK' VALUEWEAK' sentinel' luaO_nilobject_' luaO_nilobject' dummynode_' dummynode' stdout' stdin' stderr' EOF
Deficient Encapsulation,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: maskmarks' KEYWEAK' VALUEWEAK' sentinel' luaO_nilobject_' luaO_nilobject' dummynode_' dummynode' stdout' stdin' stderr' EOF
Deficient Encapsulation,KopiLua,InstructionPtr,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lcode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: codes' pc
Deficient Encapsulation,KopiLua,FilePtr,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\liolib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: file
Insufficient Modularization,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 555 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 1134 methods
Insufficient Modularization,KopiLua,Lua,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\lapi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 3169
Insufficient Modularization,AT.MIN,Tools,F:\newReposMay17\gerich-home_kopilua\src\printf\Tools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 177
