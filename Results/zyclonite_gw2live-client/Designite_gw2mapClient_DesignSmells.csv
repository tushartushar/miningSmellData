Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,gw2mapClient,Settings,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BaseUrl' Gw2RegHive' gw2RegKey
Duplicate Abstraction,gw2mapClient,Settings,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: gw2mapClient.Settings' gw2mapClient.Properties.Settings
Unnecessary Abstraction,gw2mapClient,App,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,gw2mapClient.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,gw2mapClient,Runtime,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Runtime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: gw2Controller' channelController' regController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,gw2mapClient.Controller,IStateListener,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Controller\IStateListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IStateListener' Gw2Controller
Broken Hierarchy,gw2mapClient.Controller,ChannelController,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Controller\ChannelController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AController
Broken Hierarchy,gw2mapClient.Controller,Gw2Controller,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Controller\Gw2Controller.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AController
Broken Hierarchy,gw2mapClient.Controller,Gw2LaunchController,C:\repos\zyclonite_gw2live-client\gw2mapClient\Controller\Gw2LaunchController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AController
