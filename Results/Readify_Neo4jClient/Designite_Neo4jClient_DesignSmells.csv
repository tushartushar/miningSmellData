List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  GremlinNodeEnumerable<TNode> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Readify_Neo4jClient\Neo4jClient.Shared\Gremlin\GremlinNodeEnumerable.cs' [39' 61])' GremlinRelationshipEnumerable<TData> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Readify_Neo4jClient\Neo4jClient.Shared\Gremlin\GremlinRelationshipEnumerable`TData.cs' [54' 76])' GremlinProjectionEnumerable<TResult> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Readify_Neo4jClient\Neo4jClient.Shared\Gremlin\GremlinProjectionEnumerable.cs' [38' 60])
Wide Hierarchy,Neo4jClient.Gremlin,IGremlinQuery,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Readify_Neo4jClient\Neo4jClient.Shared\Gremlin\IGremlinQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Neo4jClient.NodeReference' Neo4jClient.Node<TNode>' Neo4jClient.RelationshipReference' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.GremlinIterator' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.GremlinProjectionEnumerable<TResult>' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.GremlinQuery' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.IdentityPipe' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.IGremlinNodeQuery' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.IGremlinRelationshipQuery' Neo4jClient.Gremlin.Statement
