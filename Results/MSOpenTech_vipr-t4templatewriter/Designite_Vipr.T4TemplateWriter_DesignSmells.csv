Unutilized Abstraction,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.CodeHelpers.Java,TypeHelperJava,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\CodeHelpers\Java\TypeHelperJava.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter,OdcmModelExtensions,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\Extensions\OdcmModelExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.Extensions,StringExtensions,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\Extensions\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.Settings,TemplateWriterSettings,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\Settings\TemplateWriterSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.TemplateProcessor,ITemplateInfo,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\TemplateProcessor\ITemplateInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' TemplateLanguage' TemplateName' TemplateType
Unutilized Abstraction,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.TemplateProcessor,TemplateWriter,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\TemplateProcessor\TemplateWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.CodeHelpers.ObjC,TypeHelperObjC,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\CodeHelpers\ObjC\TypeHelperObjC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Prefix
Deficient Encapsulation,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.CodeHelpers.ObjC,TypeHelperObjC,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\CodeHelpers\ObjC\TypeHelperObjC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Prefix
Insufficient Modularization,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.CodeHelpers.ObjC,CodeWriterObjC,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\CodeHelpers\ObjC\CodeWriterObjC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Vipr.T4TemplateWriter.TemplateProcessor,TemplateFileInfo,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_vipr-t4templatewriter\src\T4TemplateWriter\TemplateProcessor\TemplateFileInfo.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TemplateInfoBase
