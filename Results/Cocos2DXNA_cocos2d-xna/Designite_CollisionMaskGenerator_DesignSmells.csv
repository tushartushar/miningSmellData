Unnecessary Abstraction,CollisionMaskGenerator,FileToProcess,F:\newReposMay17\Cocos2DXNA_cocos2d-xna\tools\CollisionMaskGenerator\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Source' Output
Duplicate Abstraction,CollisionMaskGenerator,FileToProcess,F:\newReposMay17\Cocos2DXNA_cocos2d-xna\tools\CollisionMaskGenerator\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FileToProcess[51' 84]' FileToProcess[196' 229]
Deficient Encapsulation,CollisionMaskGenerator,FileToProcess,F:\newReposMay17\Cocos2DXNA_cocos2d-xna\tools\CollisionMaskGenerator\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Source' Output
