Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,TheDotFactory,AboutForm,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\AboutForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AboutForm[1' 22]' MainForm[1' 22]
Multifaceted Abstraction,TheDotFactory,InputBoxDialog,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\InputBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Multifaceted Abstraction,TheDotFactory,MainForm,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Imperative Abstraction,TheDotFactory,OutputConfiguration,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\OutputConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: clone
Unnecessary Abstraction,TheDotFactory.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' InputText' OutputConfigIndex' InputFont' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,TheDotFactory,MainForm,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_outputConfigurationManager
Deficient Encapsulation,TheDotFactory,OutputConfiguration,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\OutputConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: commentVariableName' commentCharVisualizer' commentCharDescriptor' commentStyle' bmpVisualizerChar' rotation' flipHorizontal' flipVertical' paddingRemovalHorizontal' paddingRemovalVertical' lineWrap' bitLayout' byteOrder' byteFormat' byteLeadingString' generateLookupArray' descCharWidth' descCharHeight' descFontHeight' generateLookupBlocks' lookupBlocksNewAfterCharCount' descImgWidth' descImgHeight' generateSpaceCharacterBitmap' spaceGenerationPixels' varNfBitmaps' varNfCharInfo' varNfFontInfo' varNfWidth' varNfHeight' displayName
Deficient Encapsulation,TheDotFactory,OutputConfigurationManager,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\OutputConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: workingOutputConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TheDotFactory,AboutForm,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\AboutForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AboutForm' MainForm
Insufficient Modularization,TheDotFactory,MainForm,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TheDotFactory,MainForm,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 201
Broken Modularization,TheDotFactory.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\pavius_The-Dot-Factory\TheDotFactory\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' InputText' OutputConfigIndex' InputFont' defaultInstance
