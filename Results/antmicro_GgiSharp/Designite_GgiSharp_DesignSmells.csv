Duplicate Abstraction,AntMicro.GgiSharp,Define,C:\repos\antmicro_GgiSharp\GgiSharp\Define.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Define[1' 25]' Ggi[1' 25]' GgiEvent[1' 25]' DirectBuffer[1' 25]' Event[1' 25]
Duplicate Abstraction,AntMicro.GgiSharp,Define,C:\repos\antmicro_GgiSharp\GgiSharp\Define.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
