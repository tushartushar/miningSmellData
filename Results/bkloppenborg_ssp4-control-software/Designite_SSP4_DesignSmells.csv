Imperative Abstraction,SSP4,cCommandItem,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cCommandItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Duplicate
Unutilized Abstraction,SSP4,cListItem,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cListItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,SSP4,cSSP4Base,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cSSP4Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Unutilized Abstraction,SSP4,cStar,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cStar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SSP4.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,SSP4,frmMain,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: mbIsClosing
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SSP4,cCommunication,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cCommunication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: cCommunication' cSSP4Base
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SSP4,cCommunication,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cCommunication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: cCommunication' cSSP4Base' frmMain' cSSP4Base
Insufficient Modularization,SSP4,cSSP4Base,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\cSSP4Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SSP4,frmMain,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SSP4,frmMain,C:\repos\bkloppenborg_ssp4-control-software\SSP-4\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: frmMain' cSSP4Base
