Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AnimeRecs.Utils,AsyncUpgradeableReaderWriterLock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_animerecs\AnimeRecs.Utils\AsyncUpgradeableReaderWriterLock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AnimeRecs.Utils,ICancellableTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_animerecs\AnimeRecs.Utils\ICancellableTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Task' CancellationTokenSource
Unutilized Abstraction,AnimeRecs.Utils,CancellableTaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_animerecs\AnimeRecs.Utils\ICancellableTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AnimeRecs.Utils,SocketExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_animerecs\AnimeRecs.Utils\SocketExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AnimeRecs.Utils,AsyncUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_animerecs\AnimeRecs.Utils\AsyncUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AnimeRecs.Utils.AsyncUtils' AnimeRecs.Utils.CancellableAsyncFunc
