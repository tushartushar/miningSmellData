Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,IXmlDeclaration,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\IXmlDeclaration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Version' Encoding' Standalone
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,IXmlDeclaration,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\IXmlDeclaration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IXmlDeclaration[1' 23]' IXmlDocument[1' 23]' IXmlNode[1' 23]' XmlDocumentWrapper[1' 23]' XmlElementWrapper[1' 23]' XmlDeclarationWrapper[1' 23]' IXmlElement[1' 23]
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,IXmlDocumentType,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\IXmlDocumentType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' System' Public' InternalSubset
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,IXmlNode,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\IXmlNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IXmlNode[1' 28]' XmlElementWrapper[1' 28]
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlElementWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlElementWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: XmlElementWrapper' XmlNodeWrapper
Unfactored Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,IXmlDeclaration,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\IXmlDeclaration.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: IXmlDeclaration[1' 26]' IXmlElement[1' 26]
Unfactored Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlDocumentWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlDocumentWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XmlDocumentWrapper[1' 27]' XmlDeclarationWrapper[1' 27]
Broken Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlDeclarationWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlDeclarationWrapper.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XmlNodeWrapper' IXmlDeclaration
Unfactored Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlDocumentTypeWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlDocumentTypeWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XmlDocumentTypeWrapper[1' 21]' XmlNodeWrapper[1' 21]
Broken Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlDocumentTypeWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlDocumentTypeWrapper.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XmlNodeWrapper' IXmlDocumentType
Cyclic Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlNodeWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlNodeWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: XmlElementWrapper
Cyclic Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlNodeWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlNodeWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: XmlDeclarationWrapper
Cyclic Hierarchy,OpenGamingLibrary.Xml,XmlNodeWrapper,C:\repos\extesla_OpenGamingLibrary\Source\main\OpenGamingLibrary.Xml\XmlNodeWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: XmlDocumentTypeWrapper
