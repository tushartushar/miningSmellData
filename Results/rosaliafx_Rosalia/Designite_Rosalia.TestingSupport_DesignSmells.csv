Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.TestingSupport.Executables,Task,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\Executables\Task.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem,IFileSystemStub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\FileSystem\IFileSystemStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ParentDirectory
Feature Envy,Rosalia.TestingSupport.Helpers,ResultWrapper<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\Helpers\ResultWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertSuccess which is more interested in members of the type: ITaskResult
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.TestingSupport.Helpers,StringExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\Helpers\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.TestingSupport.Helpers,SubflowExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\Helpers\SubflowExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.TestingSupport.Helpers,TaskDefinitionsMapExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\Helpers\TaskDefinitionsMapExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.TestingSupport.Helpers,TaskResultExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\Helpers\TaskResultExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem,DirectoryStub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\FileSystem\DirectoryStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.DirectoryStub' Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.FileStub
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem,IFileSystemStub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\FileSystem\IFileSystemStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.IFileSystemStub' Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.DirectoryStub
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem,DirectoryStub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\FileSystem\DirectoryStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.DirectoryStub' Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.IFileSystemStub' Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem.FileStub
Rebellious Hierarchy,Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem,FileStub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\FileSystem\FileStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CopyTo
Cyclic Hierarchy,Rosalia.TestingSupport.FileSystem,IFileSystemStub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\FileSystem\IFileSystemStub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DirectoryStub
Rebellious Hierarchy,Rosalia.TestingSupport,SimpleLogRenderer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\SimpleLogRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Init
Rebellious Hierarchy,Rosalia.TestingSupport,SpyLogRenderer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.TestingSupport\SpyLogRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Init
