Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.FileSystem,FileSystemExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\FileSystemExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Rosalia.FileSystem,FileSystemExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\FileSystemExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FileSystemExtensions[74' 95]' FileSystemHelper[35' 56]
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.FileSystem,FileSystemHelper,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\FileSystemHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.FileSystem,IFileSystemItem,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\IFileSystemItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rosalia.FileSystem,UnknownFileSystemItem,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\UnknownFileSystemItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rosalia.FileSystem,FileList,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\FileList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FileList' IDirectory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rosalia.FileSystem,FileList,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\FileList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FileList' IDirectory' IFile
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rosalia.FileSystem,IFile,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\IFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IFile' FileList' IDirectory' FileList' IDirectory
Cyclic Hierarchy,Rosalia.FileSystem,FileSystemItem,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\FileSystemItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IDirectory
Broken Hierarchy,Rosalia.FileSystem,IDirectory,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\IDirectory.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FileSystemItem
Broken Hierarchy,Rosalia.FileSystem,IFile,D:\newReposJune17\rosaliafx_Rosalia\Src\Rosalia.FileSystem\IFile.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FileSystemItem
