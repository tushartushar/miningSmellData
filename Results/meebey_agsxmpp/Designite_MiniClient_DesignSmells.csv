Feature Envy,MiniClient,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: XmppCon_OnRosterEnd which is more interested in members of the type: RosterControl
Feature Envy,MiniClient,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: XmppCon_OnRosterItem which is more interested in members of the type: RosterControl
Feature Envy,MiniClient,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: rosterControl_SelectionChanged which is more interested in members of the type: RosterControl
Deficient Encapsulation,MiniClient,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ChatForms' GroupChatForms' Services
Deficient Encapsulation,MiniClient,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ChatForms' GroupChatForms' Services
Deficient Encapsulation,MiniClient,XmppServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Search' Proxy
Insufficient Modularization,MiniClient,frmFileTransfer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\frmFileTransfer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MiniClient,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MiniClient,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_agsxmpp\samples\VS2005\MiniClient\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 131
