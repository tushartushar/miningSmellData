Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,agsXMPP.ui.roster,TreeViewComparer,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\roster\TreeViewComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,agsXMPP.ui.xdata.Base,XDataFieldControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\Base\XDataFieldControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Validate
Duplicate Abstraction,agsXMPP.ui.xdata.Base,XDataFieldControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\Base\XDataFieldControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: XDataFieldControl[39' 60]' XDataHidden[30' 51]' XDataJidSingle[26' 47]
Imperative Abstraction,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataTextBox,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Validate
Deficient Encapsulation,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cmdCancel' cmdOK' lblTitle' panelLegend' lblLegendRequired
Unexploited Encapsulation,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: XDataTextBox' XDataHidden' XDataJidMulti' XDataListMulti (in method "CreateResponse" of class "XDataControl").
Unexploited Encapsulation,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: XDataJidSingle' XDataCheckBox (in method "CreateResponse" of class "XDataControl").
Unexploited Encapsulation,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: XDataTextBox' XDataHidden (in method "CreateSearchResponse" of class "XDataControl").
Insufficient Modularization,agsXMPP.ui.roster,RosterControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\roster\RosterControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataControl,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 123
Unfactored Hierarchy,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataCheckBox,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataCheckBox.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XDataCheckBox[1' 24]' XDataLabel[1' 24]' XDataListMulti[1' 24]' XDataListSingle[1' 24]' XDataTextBox[1' 24]
Unfactored Hierarchy,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataHidden,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataHidden.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XDataHidden[1' 20]' XDataJidSingle[1' 20]
Unfactored Hierarchy,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataJidMulti,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataJidMulti.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XDataJidMulti[43' 74]' XDataJidSingle[31' 62]
Unfactored Hierarchy,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataListMulti,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataListMulti.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XDataListMulti[64' 93]' XDataListSingle[61' 90]
Unfactored Hierarchy,agsXMPP.ui.xdata,XDataListMulti,D:\newReposJune17\meebey_agsxmpp\agsxmpp.ui\xdata\XDataListMulti.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: XDataListMulti[65' 88]' XDataTextBox[58' 81]' XDataListSingle[62' 85]
