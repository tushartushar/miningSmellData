Unnecessary Abstraction,OculusParrotKinect.Kinect.Events,VoiceCommandRejectedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Iridio_OculusArDroneKinect\OculusParrotKinect.Kinect\Events\VoiceCommandRejectedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,OculusParrotKinect.Kinect.Events,VoiceCommandRejectedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Iridio_OculusArDroneKinect\OculusParrotKinect.Kinect\Events\VoiceCommandRejectedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,OculusParrotKinect.Kinect,KinectClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Iridio_OculusArDroneKinect\OculusParrotKinect.Kinect\KinectClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GestureCommandRecognized' VoiceCommandRecognized' VoiceCommandRejected
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OculusParrotKinect.Kinect.Events,GestureCommandRecognizedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Iridio_OculusArDroneKinect\OculusParrotKinect.Kinect\Events\GestureCommandRecognizedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OculusParrotKinect.Kinect.Events.GestureCommandRecognizedEventArgs' OculusParrotKinect.Kinect.KinectClient
