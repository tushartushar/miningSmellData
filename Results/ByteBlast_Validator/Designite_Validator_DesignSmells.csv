Unutilized Abstraction,Validator.ExtensionMethods,ValidatorExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\ByteBlast_Validator\Validator\ExtensionMethods\ValidatorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Validator,Validator,F:\newReposMay17\ByteBlast_Validator\Validator\IsBase64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.98
Insufficient Modularization,Validator.ExtensionMethods,ValidatorExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\ByteBlast_Validator\Validator\ExtensionMethods\ValidatorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Validator.ExtensionMethods,ValidatorExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\ByteBlast_Validator\Validator\ExtensionMethods\ValidatorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods

Insufficient Modularization,Validator,Validator,F:\newReposMay17\ByteBlast_Validator\Validator\IsBase64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Validator,Validator,F:\newReposMay17\ByteBlast_Validator\Validator\IsBase64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
