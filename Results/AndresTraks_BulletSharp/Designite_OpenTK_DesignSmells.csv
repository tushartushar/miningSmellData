Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DemoFramework.OpenTK,GLForm,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\OpenTK\GLForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DemoFramework.OpenTK,InstanceData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\OpenTK\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' WorldTransform' Color
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.OpenTK,InstanceData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\OpenTK\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WorldTransform' Color
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.OpenTK,ShapeData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\OpenTK\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VertexCount' ElementCount' VertexBufferID' TexCoordBufferID' NormalBufferID' ElementBufferID' ElementsType' PrimitiveType' Instances' SoftBodyVertices' SoftBodyNormals
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DemoFramework.OpenTK,ShapeData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\OpenTK\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ShapeData' MeshFactory' OpenTKGraphics
Broken Hierarchy,DemoFramework.OpenTK,PhysicsDebugDraw,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\OpenTK\PhysicsDebugDraw.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BufferedDebugDraw
