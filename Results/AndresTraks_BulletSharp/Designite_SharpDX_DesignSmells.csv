Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,DemoFramework.SharpDX,InstanceData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\SharpDX\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' WorldTransform' Color' SizeInBytes
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.SharpDX,InfoText,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\SharpDX\InfoText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OverlayBufferRes
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.SharpDX,InstanceData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\SharpDX\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WorldTransform' Color
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.SharpDX,ShapeData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\SharpDX\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VertexBuffer' VertexCount' IndexBuffer' IndexCount' IndexFormat' InstanceDataBuffer' Instances' InstanceArray' PrimitiveTopology' BufferBindings' SoftBodyData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DemoFramework.SharpDX,MeshFactory,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\SharpDX\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MeshFactory' SharpDXGraphics
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DemoFramework.SharpDX,PhysicsDebugDraw,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\SharpDX\PhysicsDebugDraw.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PhysicsDebugDraw' SharpDXGraphics
