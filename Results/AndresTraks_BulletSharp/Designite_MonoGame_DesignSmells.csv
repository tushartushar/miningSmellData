Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DemoFramework.MonoGame,GraphicsDeviceControl,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\GraphicsDeviceControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetGraphics
Unnecessary Abstraction,DemoFramework.MonoGame,InstanceData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' WorldTransform' Color' SizeInBytes
Unutilized Abstraction,DemoFramework.MonoGame,XnaForm,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\XnaForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.MonoGame,MonoGameGraphics,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\MonoGameGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Device
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.MonoGame,InstanceData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WorldTransform' Color
Deficient Encapsulation,DemoFramework.MonoGame,ShapeData,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\MeshFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VertexBuffer' VertexCount' IndexBuffer' IndexCount' Instances' PrimitiveType' SoftBodyData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DemoFramework.MonoGame,MonoGameGraphics,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\MonoGameGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MonoGameGraphics' MeshFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DemoFramework.MonoGame,PhysicsDebugDraw,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\PhysicsDebugDraw.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PhysicsDebugDraw' MonoGameGraphics
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DemoFramework.MonoGame,PhysicsDebugDraw,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\PhysicsDebugDraw.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PhysicsDebugDraw' MonoGameGraphics' MeshFactory' MonoGameGraphics
Rebellious Hierarchy,DemoFramework.MonoGame,GraphicsDeviceControl,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\GraphicsDeviceControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnPaintBackground
Broken Hierarchy,DemoFramework.MonoGame,PhysicsDebugDraw,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\DemoFramework\Graphics\MonoGame\PhysicsDebugDraw.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BufferedDebugDraw
