Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ConvexDecompositionDemo,WavefrontObj,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\ConvexDecompositionDemo\Wavefront.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadObj
Deficient Encapsulation,ConvexDecompositionDemo,ConvexDecomposition,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\ConvexDecompositionDemo\ConvexDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: convexShapes' convexCentroids
Deficient Encapsulation,ConvexDecompositionDemo,ConvexDecompositionDemo,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\ConvexDecompositionDemo\ConvexDecompositionDemo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: sEnableSAT
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ConvexDecompositionDemo,ConvexDecomposition,F:\newReposMay17\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\demos\Generic\ConvexDecompositionDemo\ConvexDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ConvexDecomposition' ConvexDecompositionDemo
