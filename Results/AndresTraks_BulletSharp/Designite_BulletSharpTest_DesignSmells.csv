Duplicate Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,AxisSweepUserCallback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\AxisSweepTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AxisSweepUserCallback (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\AxisSweepTests.cs' [128' 151])' CollisionObjectArrayTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\CollisionObjectArrayTests.cs' [83' 106])' MathTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\MathTests.cs' [174' 197])' TriangleMeshTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\TriangleMeshTest.cs' [104' 127])
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,AxisSweepTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\AxisSweepTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,CollisionAlgorithmTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\CollisionAlgorithmTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,CollisionFeedbackTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\CollisionFeedbackTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,IActionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\IActionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,CollisionObjectArrayTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\CollisionObjectArrayTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,MathTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\MathTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,OverlapFilterCallbackTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\OverlapFilterCallbackTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,SoftBodyTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\SoftBodyTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,TorusMesh,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\TorusMesh.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Vertices' Indices
Unutilized Abstraction,BulletSharpTest,TriangleMeshTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\TriangleMeshTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,BulletSharpTest,DebugDrawTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\DebugDrawTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BulletSharpTest,DebugDrawTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\DebugDrawTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,BulletSharpTest,AxisSweepUserCallback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\AxisSweepTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RemoveOverlappingPairsContainingProxy
Rebellious Hierarchy,BulletSharpTest,DebugDrawTest2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AndresTraks_BulletSharp\test\DebugDrawTest2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Draw3dText' DrawContactPoint' DrawLine' ReportErrorWarning
