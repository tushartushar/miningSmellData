Insufficient Modularization,LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers,TestResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers\TestResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Broken Modularization,LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers,TestStepInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers\TestResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Parent' RuntimeId' GroupPrefix' Name' Number' Total' Name
Broken Modularization,LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers,TestScenarioInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers\TestResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Name' RuntimeId' Name' Parent' Labels' Labels' Categories' Categories
Broken Modularization,LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers,TestFeatureInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers\TestResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Name' RuntimeId' Name' Labels' Labels' Description
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers.TestableIntegration,TestCompositeStep,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers\TestableIntegration\TestCompositeStep.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers.TestableIntegration.TestCompositeStep' LightBDD.UnitTests.Helpers.TestableIntegration.TestStep
