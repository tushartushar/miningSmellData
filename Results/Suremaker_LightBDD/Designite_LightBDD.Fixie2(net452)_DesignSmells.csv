Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,LightBDD.Fixie2.Configuration,TestFrameworkConfigurationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\Configuration\TestFrameworkConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LightBDD.Fixie2,FeatureFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\FeatureFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LightBDD.Fixie2,FeatureFixtureAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\FeatureFixtureAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,LightBDD.Fixie2,IgnoreScenarioAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\IgnoreScenarioAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LightBDD.Fixie2,ScenarioAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\ScenarioAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,LightBDD.Fixie2,StepExecutionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\StepExecutionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LightBDD.Fixie2,LightBddScope,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\LightBddScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LightBDD.Fixie2.LightBddScope' LightBDD.Fixie2.Implementation.FixieFeatureCoordinator
Wide Hierarchy,LightBDD.Fixie2,FeatureFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\src\LightBDD.Fixie2\FeatureFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Basket_feature' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Calculator_feature' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Compact_calculator_scenarios' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Contacts_management' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Customer_journey' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Invoice_feature' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Invoice_history_feature' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Login_feature' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Payment_feature' Example.LightBDD.Fixie2.Features.Product_spedition_feature' LightBDD.Fixie2.UnitTests.Features_with_IgnoredScenarioTests' LightBDD.Fixie2.UnitTests.IntegrationTests
