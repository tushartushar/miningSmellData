Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,LightBDD.AcceptanceTests.Features,HTML_report_feature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HTML_report_feature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,LightBDD.AcceptanceTests.Features,HTML_report_feature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HTML_report_feature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HTML_report_feature (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HTML_report_feature.cs' [120' 139])' HTML_report_feature (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HTML_report_feature.cs' [150' 169])
Unutilized Abstraction,LightBDD.AcceptanceTests.Helpers,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Helpers\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,LightBDD.AcceptanceTests.Features,HtmlReportContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HtmlReportContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LightBDD.AcceptanceTests.Features,HtmlReportContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HtmlReportContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Broken Hierarchy,LightBDD.AcceptanceTests.Features,HTML_report_feature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Suremaker_LightBDD\test\LightBDD.AcceptanceTests\Features\HTML_report_feature.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LightBDD.NUnit3.FeatureFixture
