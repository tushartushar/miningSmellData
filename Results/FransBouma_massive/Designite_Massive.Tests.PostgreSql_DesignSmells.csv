Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Massive,ObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.PostgreSql.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Massive,ObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.PostgreSql.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ObjectExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.PostgreSql.cs' [3' 30])' DB (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.Shared.cs' [3' 30])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Massive,DB,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.Shared.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Current
Unutilized Abstraction,Massive,DB,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.Shared.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Massive.Tests,TestConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\tests\PostgreSql\ConstantsEnums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ReadWriteTestConnectionStringName
Unutilized Abstraction,PostgreSql,ReadWriteTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\tests\PostgreSql\ReadWriteTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Massive,DynamicModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.PostgreSql.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 45 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Massive,DynamicModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.PostgreSql.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 71 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Massive,DynamicModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\src\Massive.PostgreSql.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 135
Broken Hierarchy,PostgreSql.TableClasses,Customer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\tests\PostgreSql\TableClasses\Customer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Massive.DynamicModel
Broken Hierarchy,PostgreSql.TableClasses,Product,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\FransBouma_massive\tests\PostgreSql\TableClasses\Product.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Massive.DynamicModel
