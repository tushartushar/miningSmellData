Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Learning.Data,LearningContextMigrationConfiguration,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningContextMigrationConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Learning.Data,LearningDataSeeder,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningDataSeeder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Seed
Unnecessary Abstraction,Learning.Data,CoursesSeed,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningDataSeeder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubjectID' CourseName
Unutilized Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,CourseMapper,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\CourseMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,EnrollmentMapper,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\EnrollmentMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,StudentMapper,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\StudentMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,StudentMapper,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\StudentMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StudentMapper (C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\StudentMapper.cs' [17' 39])' TutorMapper (C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\TutorMapper.cs' [17' 39])
Unutilized Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,SubjectMapper,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\SubjectMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,TutorMapper,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\TutorMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Learning.Data.Entities,Subject,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Subject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Courses
Deficient Encapsulation,Learning.Data.Entities,Tutor,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Tutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Courses
Insufficient Modularization,Learning.Data,LearningRepository,C:\repos\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
