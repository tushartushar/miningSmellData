Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Learning.Data,LearningDataSeeder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningDataSeeder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Seed
Unnecessary Abstraction,Learning.Data,CoursesSeed,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningDataSeeder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubjectID' CourseName
Duplicate Abstraction,Learning.Data.Mappers,StudentMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\StudentMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StudentMapper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\StudentMapper.cs' [17' 39])' TutorMapper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Mappers\TutorMapper.cs' [17' 39])
Deficient Encapsulation,Learning.Data.Entities,Subject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Subject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Courses
Deficient Encapsulation,Learning.Data.Entities,Tutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Tutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Courses
Insufficient Modularization,Learning.Data,LearningRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Course,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Course.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Course' Learning.Data.Entities.Enrollment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Student,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Student.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Student' Learning.Data.Entities.Enrollment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Subject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Subject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Subject' Learning.Data.Entities.Course
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Tutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Tutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Tutor' Learning.Data.Entities.Course
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data,LearningContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.LearningContext' Learning.Data.LearningContextMigrationConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Course,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Course.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Course' Learning.Data.Entities.Enrollment' Learning.Data.Entities.Student
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Enrollment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Enrollment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Enrollment' Learning.Data.Entities.Course' Learning.Data.Entities.Subject
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data.Entities,Tutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\Entities\Tutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.Entities.Tutor' Learning.Data.Entities.Course' Learning.Data.Entities.Enrollment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Learning.Data,LearningContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tjoudeh_eLearning.WebAPI\Learning.Data\LearningContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Learning.Data.LearningContext' Learning.Data.LearningDataSeeder' Learning.Data.LearningContextMigrationConfiguration
