Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpTox.Av,ToxAvEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAvEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Av,ToxAvVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAvVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Av,ToxAv,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpTox.Av,ToxAv,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ToxAv (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAv.cs' [82' 103])' Tox (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\Tox.cs' [301' 322])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpTox.Av,ToxAvDelegates,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAvDelegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,SharpTox.Core,ToxDataInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxDataInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FromToxData
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpTox.Core,ToxEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Core,ConnectionEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SharpTox.Core,ToxOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ToxOptions which is more interested in members of the type: ToxOptionsStruct
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpTox.Core,ToxDelegates,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxDelegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpTox.Core,ToxErrorNew,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEnums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ToxErrorNew (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEnums.cs' [453' 474])' ToxErrorNew (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEnums.cs' [607' 628])
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpTox.Core,ToxErrorNew,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEnums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ToxErrorNew (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEnums.cs' [499' 520])' ToxErrorNew (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEnums.cs' [535' 556])
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Dns,ToxDns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Dns\ToxDns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SharpTox.Av,ToxAv,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Av\ToxAv.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpTox.Core,Tox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\Tox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 80 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpTox.Core,Tox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\Tox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 84 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpTox.Core,Tox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\Tox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 130
Broken Modularization,SharpTox.Core,ToxConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MaxMessageLength' MaxStatusMessageLength' MaxFriendRequestLenght' MaxNameLength' MaxCustomPacketSize' HashLength' PublicKeySize' SecretKeySize' AddressSize' FileIdLength' MaxFileNameLength' Cookie' CookieInner
Insufficient Modularization,SharpTox.Core,ToxFunctions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 93 methods
Wide Hierarchy,SharpTox.Core,FriendBaseEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox\Core\ToxEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: SharpTox.Core.FileBaseEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.FriendConnectionStatusEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.FriendMessageEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.NameChangeEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.StatusMessageEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.StatusEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.TypingStatusEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.FriendPacketEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.ReadReceiptEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.CustomPacketEventArgs' SharpTox.Core.GroupInviteEventArgs
