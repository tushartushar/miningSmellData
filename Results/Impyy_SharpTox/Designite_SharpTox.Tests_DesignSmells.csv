Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Test,AvFriendTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\AvFriendTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Test,AvSelfTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\AvSelfTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Test,CoreFriendTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\CoreFriendTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SharpTox.Test,CoreFriendTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\CoreFriendTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestToxFriendPublicKey which is more interested in members of the type: Tox
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Test,CoreSelfTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\CoreSelfTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpTox.Test,Globals,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\Globals.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Nodes' TcpRelays
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpTox.Test,MiscTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\MiscTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpTox.Test,Globals,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\Globals.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Nodes' TcpRelays
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpTox.Test,Globals,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Impyy_SharpTox\SharpTox.Tests\Globals.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Nodes' TcpRelays
