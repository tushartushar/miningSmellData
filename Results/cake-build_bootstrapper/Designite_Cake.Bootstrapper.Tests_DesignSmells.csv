Unnecessary Abstraction,Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests.Unit.Installer,InstallCommandTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_bootstrapper\src\Bootstrapper\Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests\Unit\Installer\InstallCommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests.Unit.Installer,InstallCommandTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_bootstrapper\src\Bootstrapper\Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests\Unit\Installer\InstallCommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests.Unit.Installer,TheExecuteMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_bootstrapper\src\Bootstrapper\Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests\Unit\Installer\InstallCommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests.Unit.Installer,TheExecuteMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cake-build_bootstrapper\src\Bootstrapper\Cake.Bootstrapper.Tests\Unit\Installer\InstallCommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
