Duplicate Abstraction,Manager_WPF,MainWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainWindow (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\MainWindow.xaml.cs' [292' 315])' MainWindow (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\MainWindow.xaml.cs' [321' 344])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Manager_WPF.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Manager_WPF,InstallPlugin,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\InstallPlugin.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: install
Insufficient Modularization,Manager_WPF,MainWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Manager_WPF,MainWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opensourceautomation_Open-Source-Automation\UI\Manager\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 116
