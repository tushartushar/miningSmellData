Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,MrAdvice.Uwp10,ArxOne.MrAdvice,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ArxOne.MrAdvice' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Introduction,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Advices' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Invocation' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Introduction.IntroducedField<TFieldType>
Unstable Dependency,MrAdvice.Uwp10,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Introduction,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ArxOne.MrAdvice,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Introduction.Invocation
Ambiguous Interface,MrAdvice.Uwp10,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: PriorityAttribute,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation.PriorityAttribute
Feature Concentration,MrAdvice.Uwp10,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AbstractTargetAttribute' PriorityAttribute]' [ExcludeAdvicesAttribute]' [ExcludePointcutAttribute' PointcutAttribute' IncludePointcutAttribute]' [ExecutionPointAttribute]' [MemberAttributes]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.62,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation.AbstractTargetAttribute' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation.PriorityAttribute' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation.ExcludeAdvicesAttribute' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation.ExecutionPointAttribute' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Annotation.MemberAttributes
Feature Concentration,MrAdvice.Uwp10,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Threading,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [TaskAccessor' TaskAccessor<TResult>]' [TaskCompletionSource' TaskCompletionSourceImplementation<TResult>' Tasks]' [TaskContinuer' TaskContinuer<TResult>]' [TaskExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,ArxOne.MrAdvice.Threading.TaskAccessor' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Threading.TaskAccessor<TResult>' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Threading.TaskContinuer' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Threading.TaskContinuer<TResult>' ArxOne.MrAdvice.Threading.TaskExtensions
