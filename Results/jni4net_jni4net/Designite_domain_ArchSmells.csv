Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.09  All the dependencies among components: from: org.drools.agent' to: org.drools' from: org.drools.agent' to: org.drools.@event.knowledgeagent' from: org.drools.agent' to:
