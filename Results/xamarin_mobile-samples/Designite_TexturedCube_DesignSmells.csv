Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\Resources\Resource.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateIdValues
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,Attribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\Resources\Resource.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,String,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\Resources\Resource.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,TexturedCubeActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\TexturedCubeActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,PaintingView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\PaintingView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,CubeModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\CubeModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' vertices' faceIndexes
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Samples.TexturedCube,Cube,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\TexturedCubeES30\Cube.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: xAngle' yAngle' xAcc' yAcc' xSign' ySign
