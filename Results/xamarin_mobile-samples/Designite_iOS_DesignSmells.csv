Unutilized Abstraction,iOS,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,iOS,iOSViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\iOSViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,iOS,iOSViewController_old,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\ComparisonsOldvsNew\iOSViewController_old.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,iOS,iOSViewController_old,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\ComparisonsOldvsNew\iOSViewController_old.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  iOSViewController_old (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\ComparisonsOldvsNew\iOSViewController_old.cs' [101' 120])' iOSViewController2a (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\ComparisonsOldvsNew\iOSViewController_new.cs' [99' 118])
Unutilized Abstraction,iOS,iOSViewController2a,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\ComparisonsOldvsNew\iOSViewController_new.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,iOS,AsyncExtrasController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\AsyncExtrasController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,iOS,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\iOS\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResignActivation' DidEnterBackground' WillEnterForeground' WillTerminate
