Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncAwait,MainPage_old,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\Windows\ComparisonOld\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AsyncAwait,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\Windows\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AsyncAwait.App' AsyncAwait.MainPage
Rebellious Hierarchy,AsyncAwait,MainPage_old,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\Windows\ComparisonOld\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnNavigatedTo
Rebellious Hierarchy,AsyncAwait,MainPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\Windows\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
