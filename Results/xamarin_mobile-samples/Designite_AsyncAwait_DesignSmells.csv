Imperative Abstraction,AsyncAwait,MainPage_old,C:\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\Windows\ComparisonOld\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitializeComponent
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncAwait,MainPage_old,C:\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\AsyncAwait\Windows\ComparisonOld\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
