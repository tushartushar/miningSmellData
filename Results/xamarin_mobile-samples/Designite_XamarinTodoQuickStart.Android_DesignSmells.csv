Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,XamarinTodoQuickStart,TodoItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\TodoItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Text' Complete
Unnecessary Abstraction,XamarinTodoQuickStart,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ApplicationURL
Imperative Abstraction,XamarinTodoQuickStart,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\obj\Debug\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateIdValues
Unutilized Abstraction,XamarinTodoQuickStart,Drawable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\obj\Debug\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XamarinTodoQuickStart,String,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\obj\Debug\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XamarinTodoQuickStart,Style,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\obj\Debug\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XamarinTodoQuickStart,TodoItemAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\TodoItemAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: XamarinTodoQuickStart.TodoItemAdapter' XamarinTodoQuickStart.TodoActivity
Missing Hierarchy,XamarinTodoQuickStart,TodoItemAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\Azure\GetStartedWithData\Android\XamarinTodoQuickStart\TodoItemAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TodoItemWrapper' TodoActivity (in method "GetView" of class "TodoItemAdapter").
