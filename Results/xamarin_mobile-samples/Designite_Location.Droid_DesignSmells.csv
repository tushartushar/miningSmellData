Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Location.Droid.Services,ServiceConnectedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\BackgroundLocationDemo\location.Android\Services\ServiceConnectedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Binder
Unutilized Abstraction,Location.Droid,MainActivity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\BackgroundLocationDemo\location.Android\MainActivity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Location.Droid,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\BackgroundLocationDemo\location.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateIdValues
Unutilized Abstraction,Location.Droid,Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\BackgroundLocationDemo\location.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Location.Droid,Style,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_mobile-samples\BackgroundLocationDemo\location.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
