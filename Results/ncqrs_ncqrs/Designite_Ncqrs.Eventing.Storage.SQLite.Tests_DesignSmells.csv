Feature Envy,Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SQLite.Tests,SQLiteEventStoreTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SqlLite.Tests\SQLiteEventStoreTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Retrieving_all_events_should_return_the_same_as_added which is more interested in members of the type: SQLiteEventStore
