Unnecessary Abstraction,Ncqrs.EventBus,IPipelineMonitoringStrategy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.EventBus\IPipelineMonitoringStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Ncqrs.EventBus,IPipelineMonitoringStrategy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.EventBus\IPipelineMonitoringStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ncqrs.EventBus,IPipelineStateMonitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.EventBus\IPipelineStateMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ncqrs.EventBus,Pipeline,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.EventBus\Pipeline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ncqrs.EventBus,IProcessingElement,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.EventBus\ProcessingElement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SequenceNumber' UniqueId' GroupingKey
Rebellious Hierarchy,Ncqrs.EventBus,ThresholdedFetchPolicy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.EventBus\ThresholdedFetchPolicy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnFetchingCompleted
