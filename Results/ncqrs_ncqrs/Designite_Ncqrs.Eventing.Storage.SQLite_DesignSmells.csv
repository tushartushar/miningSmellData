Unutilized Abstraction,Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SQLite,CommandExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SqlLite\SQLiteCommandExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SQLite,SQLiteEventStore,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SqlLite\SQLiteEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SQLite,SQLiteEventStore,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SqlLite\SQLiteEventStore.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Store which is more interested in members of the type: ISQLiteContext
Broken Modularization,Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SQLite,Query,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ncqrs_ncqrs\Extensions\src\Ncqrs.Eventing.Storage.SqlLite\Query.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DeleteUnusedProviders' InsertNewEventQuery' InsertNewProviderQuery' SelectAllEventsFromQuery' SelectAllIdsForTypeQuery' SelectVersionQuery' UpdateEventSourceVersionQuery' InsertSnapshot' SelectLatestSnapshot' CreateTables
