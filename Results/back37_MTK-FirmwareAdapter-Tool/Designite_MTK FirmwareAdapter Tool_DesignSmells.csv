Duplicate Abstraction,MTFAT,Form1,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Form1[2475' 2501]' Form1[2508' 2534]
Unutilized Abstraction,MFAT,GlassTabControl,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\GlassTabControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MFAT.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,MTFAT,Editor,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: g
Deficient Encapsulation,MTFAT,Editor,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: g
Deficient Encapsulation,MTFAT,BR_repack,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\BR_repack.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: f
Deficient Encapsulation,MTFAT,Message,C:\repos\back37_MTK-FirmwareAdapter-Tool\MTK FirmwareAdapter Tool\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fk
