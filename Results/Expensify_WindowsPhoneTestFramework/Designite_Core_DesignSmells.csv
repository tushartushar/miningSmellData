Unutilized Abstraction,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core,WindowsPhoneVersion,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\IAutomationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.Tangibles,PhoneOrientationExtensionMethods,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\Tangibles\PhoneOrientationExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.Types,ElementColor,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\Types\ElementColor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: R' G' B
Unutilized Abstraction,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.Types,ElementColor,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\Types\ElementColor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core,ProgressValues,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\ProgressValues.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Min' Max' Current
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core,IDisplayInputController,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\IDisplayInputController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.IDisplayInputController' WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.IGesture
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core,IGesture,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\IGesture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.IGesture' WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.IDisplayInputController
Insufficient Modularization,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core,IApplicationAutomationController,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\IApplicationAutomationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,WindowsPhoneTestFramework.Server.Core.Gestures,GestureBase,C:\repos\Expensify_WindowsPhoneTestFramework\Server\Core\Gestures\GestureBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Perform
