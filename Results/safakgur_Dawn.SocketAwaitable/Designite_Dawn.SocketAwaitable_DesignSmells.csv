Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketEx,C:\repos\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketAwaiter,C:\repos\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketAwaiter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetResult
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketAwaitable,C:\repos\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketAwaitable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dawn.Net.Sockets.SocketAwaitable' Dawn.Net.Sockets.SocketAwaiter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketAwaiter,C:\repos\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketAwaiter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dawn.Net.Sockets.SocketAwaiter' Dawn.Net.Sockets.SocketAwaitable
