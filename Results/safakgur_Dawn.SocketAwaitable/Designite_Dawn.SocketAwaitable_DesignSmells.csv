Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Dawn.Net.Sockets,BlockingBufferManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\BlockingBufferManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketAwaitablePool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketAwaitablePool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketEx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dawn.Net.Sockets,SocketAwaitable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\safakgur_Dawn.SocketAwaitable\src\Dawn.SocketAwaitable\SocketAwaitable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Dawn.Net.Sockets.SocketAwaitable' Dawn.Net.Sockets.SocketAwaiter
