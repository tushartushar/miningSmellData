Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,CharacterConversionHelper,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\CharacterConversionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,RDFer,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\RDFer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Imperative Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,Modifier,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\Modifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetModifierMethod
Unutilized Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,RdfOutput,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\RdfOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,ResourceNode,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\ResourceNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' xmlResouceNode' HasIdentifier
Imperative Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,XmlSplitter,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\XmlSplitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Split
Unnecessary Abstraction,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' modifiers' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,Counter,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\Counter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CounterValue' Iteration
Deficient Encapsulation,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,ResourceNode,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\ResourceNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: xmlResouceNode' HasIdentifier
Deficient Encapsulation,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,UniqueIdentifier,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\UniqueIdentifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name
Deficient Encapsulation,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,XmlSplitter,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\XmlSplitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SplitTotal
Insufficient Modularization,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,RDFer,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\RDFer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,JoshanMahmud.SemanticWeb.RdfConversion,RDFer,C:\repos\jmahmud_RDFer\RDFerSolution\RDFer\RDFer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 240
