Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.shared,BetterExpando,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\BetterExpando.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.shared,LoggingBootstrap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\LoggingBootstrap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Blocks,TimedBufferBlock<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Blocks\TimedBufferBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Encryption,SimplerAES,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Encryption\SimplerAES.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Factories,MessageParserBlockFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Factories\MessageParserBlockFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,MSSQLRelayListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\MSSQLRelayListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LinkTo
Imperative Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,HttpStatsListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\HttpStatsListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LinkTo
Imperative Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,RequestDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\HttpStatsListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnRequest
Feature Envy,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,RequestDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\HttpStatsListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProcessGETRequest which is more interested in members of the type: HttpStatsListener
Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,IMessageProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\IMessageProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,IMessageProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\IMessageProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Listeners,StatsdnetTcpListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Listeners\StatsdnetTcpListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LinkTo
Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.shared.Services,ISystemInfoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Services\SystemInfoService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HostName
Deficient Encapsulation,statsd.net.shared.Structures,DecoderBlockPacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net.shared\Structures\DecoderBlockPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: data' isCompressed
