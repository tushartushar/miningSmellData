Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.Backends.Librato,APIPayload,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\Librato\APIPayload.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: source' gauges' counters' measure_time
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.Backends.Librato,LibratoErrorDetectionStrategy,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\Librato\LibratoBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.Backends.SqlServer,SqlServerErrorDetectionStrategy,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\SqlServer\SqlServerErrorDetectionStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Imperative Abstraction,statsd.net.Backends.Statsdnet,StatsdnetForwardingClient,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\Statsdnet\StatsdnetForwardingClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Send
Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.Configuration,AggregatorConfiguration,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Configuration\AggregatorConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.Configuration,BackendConfiguration,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Configuration\BackendConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.Configuration,ConsoleConfiguration,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Configuration\BackendConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.Configuration,ConsoleConfiguration,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Configuration\BackendConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,statsd.net.Configuration,ListenerConfiguration,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Configuration\ListenerConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.Framework,TimedSetAggregatorBlockFactory,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Framework\TimedSetAggregatorBlockFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,statsd.net.Framework,ProjectInstaller,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Framework\ProjectInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,statsd.net,Statsd,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Statsd.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: UDPListenerConfiguration' TCPListenerConfiguration' StatsdnetListenerConfiguration (in method "LoadListeners" of class "Statsd").
Unexploited Encapsulation,statsd.net,Statsd,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Statsd.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: HTTPListenerConfiguration' MSSQLRelayListenerConfiguration (in method "LoadListeners" of class "Statsd").
Unfactored Hierarchy,statsd.net.Backends,GraphiteTCPBackend,C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\GraphiteTCPBackend.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  GraphiteTCPBackend (C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\GraphiteTCPBackend.cs' [61' 83])' SqlServerBackend (C:\repos\lukevenediger_statsd.net\statsd.net\Backends\SqlServer\SqlServerBackend.cs' [83' 105])
