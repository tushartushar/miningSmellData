Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.5  All the dependencies among components: from: ExampleExternalBackend' to: statsd.net.core' from: ExampleExternalBackend' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net.Backends' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.Backends' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net.Backends' to: statsd.net.Configuration' from: statsd.net.Backends' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.Backends' to: statsd.net.core.Messages' from: statsd.net.Backends.Librato' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.Backends.Librato' to: statsd.net.Configuration' from: statsd.net.Backends.Librato' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.Backends.Librato' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net.Backends.Librato' to: statsd.net.shared.Structures' from: statsd.net.Backends.SqlServer' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.Backends.SqlServer' to: statsd.net.Configuration' from: statsd.net.Backends.SqlServer' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.Backends.SqlServer' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net.Backends.SqlServer' to: statsd.net.core.Messages' from: statsd.net.Backends.Statsdnet' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.Backends.Statsdnet' to: statsd.net.Configuration' from: statsd.net.Backends.Statsdnet' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.Backends.Statsdnet' to: statsd.net.core.Messages' from: statsd.net.Backends.Statsdnet' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net.Configuration' to: statsd.net.core.Backends' from: statsd.net.Configuration' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.Framework' to: statsd.net.shared.Structures' from: statsd.net.Framework' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.Framework' to: statsd.net.shared.Services' from: statsd.net.Framework' to: statsd.net.shared.Messages' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.Configuration' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.Framework' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.shared.Services' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.shared.Factories' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.core.Backends' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.shared.Messages' from: statsd.net' to: statsd.net.shared.Listeners' from: statsd.net.core.Backends' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.shared.Blocks' to: statsd.net.shared.Services' from: statsd.net.shared.Factories' to: statsd.net.shared.Messages' from: statsd.net.shared.Factories' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.shared.Listeners' to: statsd.net.shared.Services' from: statsd.net.shared.Listeners' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net.shared.Listeners' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.shared.Listeners' to: statsd.net.shared.Structures' from: statsd.net.shared.Services' to: statsd.net.shared.Structures' from: statsd.net.shared.Services' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net.shared.Services' to: statsd.net.core.Backends' from: statsd.net.shared.Structures' to: statsd.net.core.Messages' from: statsd.net.shared.Structures' to: statsd.net.shared.Services' from: statsd.net.shared.Structures' to: statsd.net.shared.Messages' from: statsd.net_Tests.Infrastructure' to: statsd.net.core.Structures' from: statsd.net_Tests.Infrastructure' to: statsd.net.core.Messages' from: statsd.net_Tests.Infrastructure' to: statsd.net.shared.Structures' from: statsd.net_Tests.Infrastructure' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net_Tests.Infrastructure' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.shared.Factories' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.shared.Messages' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net_Tests.Infrastructure' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.core' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.shared' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.Framework' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.shared.Structures' from: statsd.net_Tests' to: statsd.net.core.Messages.,statsd.net.ServiceWrapper' statsd.net.ServiceWrapper' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd' statsd.net.Statsd
