Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionMagicTests,ConstructorSelectionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ConstructorSelectionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReflectionMagicTests,ExtensionMethodFacts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ExtensionMethodFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionMagicTests,ExtensionMethodFacts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ExtensionMethodFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionMagicTests,TheAsDynamicMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ExtensionMethodFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReflectionMagicTests,CustomStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ExtensionMethodFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ReflectionMagicTests,UnitTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\UnitTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ReflectionMagicTests,TheAsDynamicMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ExtensionMethodFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PrimitiveValues
Deficient Encapsulation,ReflectionMagicTests,TheAsDynamicMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\ExtensionMethodFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PrimitiveValues
Insufficient Modularization,ReflectionMagicTests,UnitTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\UnitTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ReflectionMagicTests,UnitTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidebbo_ReflectionMagic\test\ReflectionMagicTests\UnitTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
