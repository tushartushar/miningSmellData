Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Robotics.Mobile.BtLEExplorer,EmptyStringConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Extensions\EmptyStringConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Robotics.Mobile.BtLEExplorer,GuidConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Extensions\GuidConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BLEExplorer.Pages,CharacteristicDetail_TISensor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Pages\CharacteristicDetail_TISensor.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BLEExplorer.Pages,CharacteristicDetail_TISwitch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Pages\CharacteristicDetail_TISwitch.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,BLEExplorer.Pages,CharacteristicDetail_TISwitch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Pages\CharacteristicDetail_TISwitch.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SwitchToggled which is more interested in members of the type: ICharacteristic
Feature Envy,BLEExplorer.Pages,DeviceList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Pages\DeviceList.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StartScanning which is more interested in members of the type: IAdapter
Feature Envy,BLEExplorer.Pages,DeviceList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Pages\DeviceList.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StopScanning which is more interested in members of the type: IAdapter
Feature Envy,BLEExplorer.Pages,TxRx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\Pages\TxRx.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BtnSendClicked which is more interested in members of the type: ICharacteristic
Rebellious Hierarchy,BLEExplorer,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Sample Apps\BLE Explorer\BLEExplorer\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStart' OnSleep' OnResume
