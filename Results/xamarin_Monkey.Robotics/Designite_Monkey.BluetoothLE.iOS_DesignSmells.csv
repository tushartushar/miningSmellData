Unutilized Abstraction,Robotics.Mobile.Core.iOS,BluetoothLEManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Source\Monkey.BluetoothLE.iOS\BluetoothLE\BluetoothLEManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Robotics.Mobile.Core.Bluetooth.LE,Device,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Monkey.Robotics\Source\Monkey.BluetoothLE.iOS\Bluetooth\LE\Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Robotics.Mobile.Core.Bluetooth.LE.Device' Robotics.Mobile.Core.Bluetooth.LE.Adapter
