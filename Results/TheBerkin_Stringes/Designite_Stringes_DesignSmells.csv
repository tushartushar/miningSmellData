Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Stringes,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TheBerkin_Stringes\Stringes\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Stringes,Stringe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TheBerkin_Stringes\Stringes\Stringe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Stringes,Stringe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TheBerkin_Stringes\Stringes\Stringe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Stringes,Stringe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TheBerkin_Stringes\Stringes\Stringe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
Insufficient Modularization,Stringes,StringeReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TheBerkin_Stringes\Stringes\StringeReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods).
