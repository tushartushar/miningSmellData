Duplicate Abstraction,Potato.Database,Driver,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Driver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Driver (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Driver.cs' [1' 23])' IDriver (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\IDriver.cs' [1' 23])
Duplicate Abstraction,Potato.Database,DriverSettings,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\DriverSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DriverSettings (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\DriverSettings.cs' [1' 21])' IDriverSettings (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\IDriverSettings.cs' [1' 21])
Unexploited Encapsulation,Potato.Database.Drivers,MongoDbDriver,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\MongoDbDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Find' Modify' Drop (in method "Query" of class "MongoDbDriver").
Unexploited Encapsulation,Potato.Database.Drivers,MongoDbDriver,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\MongoDbDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Remove' Merge (in method "Query" of class "MongoDbDriver").
Broken Modularization,Potato.Database,DriverSettings,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\DriverSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Hostname' Port' Username' Password' Database' Memory

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Hostname' Port' Username' Password' Database' Memory
Rebellious Hierarchy,Potato.Database,Driver,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Driver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect' Query' Query' Close
Unfactored Hierarchy,Potato.Database.Drivers,SqLiteDriver,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\SqLiteDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  SqLiteDriver (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\SqLiteDriver.cs' [1' 20])' MySqlDriver (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\MySqlDriver.cs' [1' 20])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Potato.Database.Drivers,SqLiteDriver,C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\SqLiteDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  SqLiteDriver (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\SqLiteDriver.cs' [99' 144])' MySqlDriver (C:\repos\Myrcon_Procon-2-Potato\src\Potato.Database\Drivers\MySqlDriver.cs' [91' 136])
