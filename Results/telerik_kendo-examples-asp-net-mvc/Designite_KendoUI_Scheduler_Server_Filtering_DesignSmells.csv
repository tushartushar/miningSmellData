Unutilized Abstraction,KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering,MvcApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc\scheduler-server-filtering\KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering.Controllers,HomeController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc\scheduler-server-filtering\KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering\Controllers\HomeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering.Models,MeetingAtendee,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc\scheduler-server-filtering\KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering\Models\MeetingAtendee.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MeetingID' AtendeeID' Meeting
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering.Models,Meeting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc\scheduler-server-filtering\KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering\Models\Meeting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering.Models.Meeting' KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering.Models.MeetingAtendee
Rebellious Hierarchy,KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering.Models,SampleEntities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\telerik_kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc\scheduler-server-filtering\KendoUI_Scheduler_Server_Filtering\Models\SchedulerSample.Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnModelCreating
