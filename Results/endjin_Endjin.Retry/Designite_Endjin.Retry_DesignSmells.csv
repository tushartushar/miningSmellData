Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Endjin.Core.Repeat,PeriodicTaskFactory,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Repeat\PeriodicTaskFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Unutilized Abstraction,Endjin.Core.Repeat,PeriodicTaskFactory,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Repeat\PeriodicTaskFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Endjin.Core.Repeat,Repeatable,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Repeat\Repeatable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Endjin.Core.Repeat.Strategies,BackOffPeriodicityStrategy,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Repeat\Strategies\BackOffPeriodicityStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BackOffPeriodicityStrategy[21' 41]' Backoff[30' 50]
Duplicate Abstraction,Endjin.Core.Retry,Retriable,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Retry\Retriable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Retriable[63' 86]' Retriable[135' 158]
Duplicate Abstraction,Endjin.Core.Retry,Retriable,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Retry\Retriable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Retriable[101' 126]' Retriable[174' 199]
Broken Modularization,Endjin.Core.Retry,RetryTask,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Retry\RetryTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SleepService' Factory' SleepService' Factory' factory' factory
Insufficient Modularization,Endjin.Core.Retry,RetryTaskFactory,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Retry\RetryTaskFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 58 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Endjin.Core.Retry,RetryTaskFactory,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Retry\RetryTaskFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 63 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Endjin.Core.Repeat.Strategies,LinearPeriodicityStrategy,F:\newReposMay17\endjin_Endjin.Retry\Solutions\Endjin.Retry\Repeat\Strategies\LinearPeriodicityStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Reset
