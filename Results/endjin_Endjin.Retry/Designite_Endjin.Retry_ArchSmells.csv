Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Endjin.Retry,Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies' Endjin.Core.Retry,Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies.IRetryStrategy' Endjin.Core.Retry.Retriable
Unstable Dependency,Endjin.Retry,Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Endjin.Core.Retry,Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies.RetryEventArgs
Feature Concentration,Endjin.Retry,Endjin.Core.Retry,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Retriable]' [RetryEventArgs]' [RetryTask' RetryTaskFactory' RetryTask<T>' RetryTaskFactory<T>]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,Endjin.Core.Retry.Retriable' Endjin.Core.Retry.RetryEventArgs
Scattered Functionality,Endjin.Retry,Endjin.Core.Retry,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies' Endjin.Retry.Contracts,Endjin.Core.Retry.Strategies.IRetryStrategy' Endjin.Retry.Contracts.ISleepService
