Unnecessary Abstraction,MiniTestRunner.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Core\MiniTestRunner\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,MiniTestRunner,Link<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Core\MiniTestRunner\Model\TaskRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value' Next
Unexploited Encapsulation,MiniTestRunner.Model,ProjectModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Core\MiniTestRunner\Model\ProjectModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: AssemblyScanTask' ITaskEx (in method "OnTaskComplete" of class "ProjectModel").
Broken Modularization,MiniTestRunner.Model,Assembly,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Core\MiniTestRunner\Model\ProjectModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path' Domain' Row' UpdatePending' _updatePending
