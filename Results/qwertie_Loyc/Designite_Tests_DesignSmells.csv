Unutilized Abstraction,Samples,EmailAddress,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Samples,EmailAddress,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Samples.EmailAddress' ADT.EmailAddress
Duplicate Abstraction,Samples,SExprParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Samples.SExprParser' ADT.SExprParser
Feature Envy,Samples,SExprParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Atom which is more interested in members of the type: LNodeFactory
Feature Envy,Samples,SExprParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: List which is more interested in members of the type: LNodeFactory
Feature Envy,ADT,SExprParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.

Rebellious Hierarchy,ADT,StringListWidget,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WithLocation
Rebellious Hierarchy,ADT,Container,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\Tests\Samples.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WithLocation
