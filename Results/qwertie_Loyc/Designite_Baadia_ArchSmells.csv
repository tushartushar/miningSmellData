Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Feature Concentration,Baadia,Util.Collections,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IListChanging' OwnedList<T>' ChildList<Parent'T>' OwnedChildList<Parent'T>]' [IChildOf' IChildOfOneParent' ChildOfOneParent<TParent>' IHasParent]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,Util.Collections.IChildOf' Util.Collections.IChildOfOneParent' Util.Collections.ChildOfOneParent<TParent>' Util.Collections.IHasParent
Scattered Functionality,Baadia,Util.WinForms,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Loyc.Geometry' Loyc.Collections,Loyc.Geometry.Point' Loyc.Collections.DList' Loyc.Collections.ListExt
Scattered Functionality,Baadia,Util.Collections,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Loyc.Collections' Loyc.Collections.Impl,Loyc.Collections.ListExt' Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalDList
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.15  All the dependencies among components: from: BoxDiagrams' to: Util.WinForms' from: BoxDiagrams' to: Loyc.Geometry' from: BoxDiagrams' to: Loyc.Collections' from: BoxDiagrams'
