Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,LeMP,CodeContractRewriter,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\ContractsMacro.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: PrependStmtsToGetterOrSetter
Unutilized Abstraction,LeMP.CSharp6,CSharp6Macros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\CSharp6Macro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,LeMP,StandardMacros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AddLineDirectivesMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Symbol' Symbol (in method "UseSymbolsCore" of class "StandardMacros").
Deficient Encapsulation,LeMP,AltType,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AlgebraicDataType.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TypeName' BaseTypes' ParentType
Deficient Encapsulation,LeMP,AdtParam,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AlgebraicDataType.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OriginalDecl' ContainingType
Deficient Encapsulation,LeMP,CodeQuoter,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\CodeQuoteMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _sink' _doSubstitutions' _ignoreTrivia
Deficient Encapsulation,LeMP,CodeMatchContext,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\MatchCode.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UsageCounters' NodeVars' ListVars' ThenClause' Context' IsMultiCase' Tests
Deficient Encapsulation,LeMP,UnrollCtx,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\UnrollMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Replacements
Deficient Encapsulation,LeMP,EliminateRunSequences,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\UseSequenceExpressions.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Context
Insufficient Modularization,LeMP,StandardMacros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AddLineDirectivesMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 73 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LeMP,StandardMacros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AddLineDirectivesMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 117 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LeMP,StandardMacros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AddLineDirectivesMacro.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 401
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LeMP,AltType,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AlgebraicDataType.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LeMP.AltType' LeMP.AdtParam
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LeMP,AdtParam,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\AlgebraicDataType.out.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LeMP.AdtParam' LeMP.AltType
Insufficient Modularization,LeMP.Prelude.Les,Macros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\Prelude.Les.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 86 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LeMP.Prelude.Les,Macros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\Prelude.Les.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 95 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LeMP.Prelude.Les,Macros,C:\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMP.StdMacros\Prelude.Les.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 190
