Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,TextEditor,FindAndReplaceForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\FindAndReplaceForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SelectResult which is more interested in members of the type: TextEditorControl
Unutilized Abstraction,TextEditor,ColorExt,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\FindAndReplaceForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TextEditor,LempDemoForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\LempDemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: menuFindAgain_Click which is more interested in members of the type: FindAndReplaceForm
Feature Envy,TextEditor,LempDemoForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\LempDemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: menuFindAgainReverse_Click which is more interested in members of the type: FindAndReplaceForm
Deficient Encapsulation,TextEditor,FindAndReplaceForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\FindAndReplaceForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _lastSearchWasBackward' _lastSearchLoopedAround
Deficient Encapsulation,TextEditor,TextEditorSearcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\FindAndReplaceForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MatchCase' MatchWholeWordOnly
Deficient Encapsulation,TextEditor,Compiler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\LempDemoPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Output
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Windows.Forms,InputBoxDialog,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\InputBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: txtInput
Insufficient Modularization,TextEditor,LempDemoForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\LempDemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Broken Hierarchy,TextEditor,TextRange,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\FindAndReplaceForm.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ICSharpCode.TextEditor.Document.AbstractSegment
Missing Hierarchy,TextEditor,LempDemoPanel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\qwertie_Loyc\Main\LeMPDemo\LempDemoPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SourcePos' SourceRange (in method "GetSourcePos" of class "LempDemoPanel").
