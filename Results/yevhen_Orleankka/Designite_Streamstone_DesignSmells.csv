Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Example,EventSourcedActor,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Infrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnActivate
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,EventEntity,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Infrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Type' Data
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,SS,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Infrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Table
Unutilized Abstraction,Example,Bootstrap,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Infrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,Properties,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Infrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' StorageAccount' TableName
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,Deactivate,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,GetDetails,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,InventoryItemDeactivated,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,Example,Properties,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Infrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StorageAccount' TableName
Broken Hierarchy,Example,InventoryItem,C:\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Source\Example.EventSourcing.Persistence.Streamstone\Domain.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Example.EventSourcedActor
