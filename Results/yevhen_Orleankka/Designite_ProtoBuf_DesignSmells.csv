Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,IInventoryItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Domain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Example,MessagesReflection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MessagesReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs' [331' 370])' MessagesReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs' [448' 487])
Duplicate Abstraction,Example,MessagesReflection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MessagesReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs' [372' 397])' MessagesReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs' [489' 514])
Duplicate Abstraction,Example,MessagesReflection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MessagesReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs' [553' 583])' MessagesReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs' [642' 672])
Multifaceted Abstraction,Example,InventoryItemDetails,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleankka,DemoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Shared.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Example,MessagesReflection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Example.MessagesReflection' Example.InventoryItemDetails
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Example,GetDetails,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Example.GetDetails' Example.MessagesReflection' Example.InventoryItemDetails
Broken Hierarchy,Example,InventoryItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Serialization\ProtoBuf\Domain.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Orleankka.DispatchActorGrain' Example.IInventoryItem
