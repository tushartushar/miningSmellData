Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,Write,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Reentrant\ReaderWriterLock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Value' Delay
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,Read,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Reentrant\ReaderWriterLock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Example,IReaderWriterLock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Reentrant\ReaderWriterLock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Orleankka,DemoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Shared.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Example,Write,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Reentrant\ReaderWriterLock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value' Delay
Broken Hierarchy,Example,ReaderWriterLock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yevhen_Orleankka\Samples\CSharp\Reentrant\ReaderWriterLock.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Orleankka.DispatchActorGrain' Example.IReaderWriterLock
