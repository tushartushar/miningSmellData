Unutilized Abstraction,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework,AdvancedBranchingExpression<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\Framework\AdvancedBranchingExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework,BranchingExpression<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\Framework\BranchingExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,HelperExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\HelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,ITransition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\ITransition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: WorkflowId' From' To
Unutilized Abstraction,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,StatefulErrorHandler<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\StatefulErrorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,StatefulWorkflowExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\StatefulWorkflowExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,StatefulWorkflow<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\StatefulWorkflow.Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,StatefulWorkflow<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\StatefulWorkflow.Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework,AbstractBranchingCondition<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\Framework\AbstractBranchingCondition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework.AbstractBranchingCondition<T>' Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework.FailureExpression<T>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework,ISecurityConfigurationExpresion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\Framework\ISecurityConfigurationExpresion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework.ISecurityConfigurationExpresion' Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework.IConfigurationExpression
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework,IBranchingExpression,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\Framework\IBranchingExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.Framework.IBranchingExpression' Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful.IStatefulWorkflow
Rebellious Hierarchy,Rainbow.ObjectFlow.Stateful,StatefulWorkflow<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tkellogg_objectflow\objectflow.stateful\StatefulWorkflow.Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TransitionRule' ErrorHandler
