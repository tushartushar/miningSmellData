Unutilized Abstraction,WebSocket4Net.Common,StringCommandInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Common\StringCommandInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,HandshakeReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\HandshakeReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetCommandInfo
Deficient Encapsulation,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,DraftHybi00Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\DraftHybi00Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CloseHandshake
Deficient Encapsulation,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,DraftHybi00Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\DraftHybi00Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CloseHandshake
Broken Modularization,WebSocket4Net,OpCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\OpCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Handshake' Text' Binary' Close' Ping' Pong' BadRequest
Insufficient Modularization,WebSocket4Net,WebSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\WebSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Broken Modularization,WebSocket4Net,WebSocketStateConst,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\WebSocketState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' None' Connecting' Open' Closing' Closed
Insufficient Modularization,WebSocket4Net.Common,ArraySegmentList<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Common\ArraySegmentList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,ICloseStatusCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\ICloseStatusCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ExtensionNotMatch' GoingAway' InvalidUTF8' NormalClosure' NotAcceptableData' ProtocolError' TLSHandshakeFailure' TooLargeFrame' UnexpectedCondition' ViolatePolicy' NoStatusCode
Rebellious Hierarchy,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,DraftHybi00Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\DraftHybi00Processor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SendData' SendData' SendPing' SendPong
Rebellious Hierarchy,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,ProtocolProcessorBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\ProtocolProcessorBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SendHandshake' CreateHandshakeReader' VerifyHandshake' SendMessage' SendCloseHandshake' SendPing' SendPong' SendData' SendData
Rebellious Hierarchy,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,ReaderBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\ReaderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetCommandInfo
Broken Hierarchy,WebSocket4Net.Protocol,Rfc6455Processor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\Rfc6455Processor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WebSocket4Net.Protocol.DraftHybi10Processor
Rebellious Hierarchy,WebSocket4Net.Protocol.FramePartReader,DataFramePartReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\WebSocket4Net\Protocol\FramePartReader\DataFramePartReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Process
