Unnecessary Abstraction,WebSocket4Net.Test.Json,AddIn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\Test\Test\Json\AddIn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: A' B
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebSocket4Net.Test.Json,AddOut,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\Test\Test\Json\AddOut.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Result
Broken Hierarchy,WebSocket4Net.Test,WebSocketClientTestHybi00,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_WebSocket4Net\Test\Test\WebSocketClientTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WebSocket4Net.Test.WebSocketClientTest
