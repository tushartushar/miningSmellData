Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DBHelpers.Tests,DBConvertTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBConvertTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DBHelpers.Tests,DBConvertTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBConvertTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DBConvertTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBConvertTests.cs' [104' 123])' DBConvertTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBConvertTests.cs' [128' 147])
Unutilized Abstraction,DBHelpers.Tests,DataReaderConverterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DataReaderConverterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExecuteArray which is more interested in members of the type: InternalDBHelper
Feature Envy,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExecuteDictionary which is more interested in members of the type: InternalDBHelper
Feature Envy,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExecuteList which is more interested in members of the type: InternalDBHelper
Feature Envy,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExecuteObject which is more interested in members of the type: InternalDBHelper
Feature Envy,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FillFromReader which is more interested in members of the type: InternalDBHelper
Feature Envy,DBHelpers.Tests,DBHelperTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\DBHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FillFromReader which is more interested in members of the type: InternalDBHelper
Unnecessary Abstraction,DBHelpers.Tests,DataReaderModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\MockProviderFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DateCol' IntCol' StringCol' UnmappedCol
Unutilized Abstraction,DBHelpers.Tests,TypeExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DBHelpers.Tests,MockProviderFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nvivo_dbhelpers\Src\DBHelpers.Tests\MockProviderFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NewConnection' NewParameter' NewDataAdapter
