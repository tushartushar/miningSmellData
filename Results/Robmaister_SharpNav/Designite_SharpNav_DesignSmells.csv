Broken Modularization,SharpNav.Pathfinding,OffMeshConnection,C:\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav\Pathfinding\OffMeshConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Pos0' Pos1' Radius' Poly' Flags' Side' Tag
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpNav.Pathfinding,NavPolyId,C:\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav\Pathfinding\NavPolyId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpNav.Pathfinding.NavPolyId' SharpNav.Pathfinding.NavPolyIdManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpNav.Pathfinding,NavPolyIdManager,C:\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav\Pathfinding\NavPolyIdManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpNav.Pathfinding.NavPolyIdManager' SharpNav.Pathfinding.NavPolyId
Broken Modularization,SharpNav.Pathfinding,NavMeshInfo,C:\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav\Pathfinding\PathfindingCommon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y' Layer' PolyCount' VertCount' MaxLinkCount' DetailMeshCount' DetailVertCount' DetailTriCount' BvNodeCount' OffMeshConCount' OffMeshBase' WalkableHeight' WalkableRadius' WalkableClimb' Bounds' BvQuantFactor
Broken Hierarchy,SharpNav,NavMesh,C:\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav\NavMesh.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SharpNav.TiledNavMesh
