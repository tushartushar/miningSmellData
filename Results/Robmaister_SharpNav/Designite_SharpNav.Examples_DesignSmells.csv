Imperative Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,AgentCylinder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\AgentCylinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Draw
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,AgentCylinder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\AgentCylinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SharpNav.Examples,ExampleWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DrawPolyMesh which is more interested in members of the type: PolyMesh
Feature Envy,SharpNav.Examples,ExampleWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DrawPolyMeshDetail which is more interested in members of the type: PolyMeshDetail
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,AgentTrail,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Trail' HTrail
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,AreaIdGenerationSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.UI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxTriSlope' MinLevelHeight' MaxLevelHeight
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,AreaIdGenerationSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.UI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,GwenTextWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\GwenTextWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpNav.Examples,ObjModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ObjModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpNav.Examples,AgentTrail,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Trail' HTrail
Insufficient Modularization,SharpNav.Examples,ExampleWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpNav.Examples,ExampleWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\ExampleWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 172
Insufficient Modularization,SharpNav.Examples,GwenTextWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\GwenTextWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpNav.Examples,GwenTextWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpNav\Source\SharpNav.Examples\GwenTextWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
