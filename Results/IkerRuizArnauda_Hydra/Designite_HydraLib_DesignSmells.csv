Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,HydraLib,HydraLib,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\HydraLib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,HydraLib,HydraLib,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\HydraLib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,HydraLib.Nodes,Connector,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\Connector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Connector[1' 21]' Node[1' 21]
Deficient Encapsulation,HydraLib.Nodes,Node,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\Node.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Input' Output
Wide Hierarchy,HydraLib.Nodes,Node,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\Node.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Addition' Average' Constant' Division' Formula' Multiplication' Substraction' TestDevice' Hysteresis' Maximum' MaxValue' Minimum' MinValue' MultipleScale' Negation' PonderedAverage' Power' Scale' Slope' StandardDeviation
Unfactored Hierarchy,HydraLib.Nodes.NodeTypes,Addition,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\NodeTypes\Arithmetic\Addition.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Addition[1' 24]' Average[1' 24]' Constant[1' 24]' Division[1' 24]' Multiplication[1' 24]' Substraction[1' 24]
Unfactored Hierarchy,HydraLib.Nodes.NodeTypes,Addition,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\NodeTypes\Arithmetic\Addition.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Addition[1' 22]' Formula[1' 22]' Average[1' 22]' Constant[1' 22]' Division[1' 22]' Multiplication[1' 22]' Substraction[1' 22]
Broken Hierarchy,HydraLib.Nodes.NodeTypes,Constant,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\NodeTypes\Arithmetic\Constant.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Node
Unfactored Hierarchy,HYDRA.Nodes.NodeTypes,Hysteresis,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\NodeTypes\Arithmetic\Hysteresis.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Hysteresis[1' 21]' Maximum[1' 21]' MaxValue[1' 21]' Minimum[1' 21]' MinValue[1' 21]' MultipleScale[1' 21]' Negation[1' 21]' Power[1' 21]' Scale[1' 21]' Slope[1' 21]' StandardDeviation[1' 21]' PonderedAverage[1' 21]
Unfactored Hierarchy,HYDRA.Nodes.NodeTypes,Hysteresis,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\NodeTypes\Arithmetic\Hysteresis.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Hysteresis[1' 24]' PonderedAverage[1' 24]
Unfactored Hierarchy,HYDRA.Nodes.NodeTypes,Maximum,C:\repos\IkerRuizArnauda_Hydra\HydraLib\Nodes\NodeTypes\Arithmetic\Maximum.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Maximum[1' 27]' MaxValue[1' 27]' Minimum[1' 27]' MinValue[1' 27]' MultipleScale[1' 27]' Negation[1' 27]' Power[1' 27]' Scale[1' 27]' Slope[1' 27]' StandardDeviation[1' 27]
