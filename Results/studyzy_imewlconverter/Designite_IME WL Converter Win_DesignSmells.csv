Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,EncodingComboBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\EncodingComboBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Forms\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetBatchFilters which is more interested in members of the type: FilterConfig
Feature Envy,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Forms\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetReplaceFilters which is more interested in members of the type: FilterConfig
Feature Envy,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Forms\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetFilters which is more interested in members of the type: FilterConfig
Unnecessary Abstraction,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Forms\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Win10MsPinyin' Win10MsWubi (in method "backgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted" of class "MainForm").
Unexploited Encapsulation,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,WordRankGenerateForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Forms\WordRankGenerateForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: DefaultWordRankGenerater' GoogleWordRankGenerater (in method "WordRankGenerateForm_Load" of class "WordRankGenerateForm").
Insufficient Modularization,Studyzy.IMEWLConverter,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\studyzy_imewlconverter\src\IME WL Converter Win\Forms\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
