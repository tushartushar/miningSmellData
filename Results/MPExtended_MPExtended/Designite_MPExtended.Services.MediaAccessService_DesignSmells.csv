Duplicate Abstraction,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,Finalization,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\Finalization.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Finalization (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\Finalization.cs' [1' 21])' ILibraryList (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\LibraryList.cs' [1' 21])
Duplicate Abstraction,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,PluginData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\PluginData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Insufficient Modularization,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,MediaAccessService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\MediaAccessService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 130 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,MediaAccessService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\MediaAccessService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 134 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,MediaAccessService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\MediaAccessService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 178
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,LibraryList<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\LibraryList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService.LibraryList<T>' MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService.ProviderHandler
Missing Hierarchy,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,Finalization,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\Finalization.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IArtwork' IActors' ICategorySortable (in method "ForItem" of class "Finalization").
Rebellious Hierarchy,MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService,ServicePlugin,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MPExtended_MPExtended\Services\MPExtended.Services.MediaAccessService\ServicePlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start
