Deficient Encapsulation,UserSimulation,Error,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\Error.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: row' col' path' workbook' worksheet' value
Deficient Encapsulation,UserSimulation,PrepData,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\PrepData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dag' original_inputs' correct_outputs' terminal_input_nodes' terminal_formula_nodes
Deficient Encapsulation,UserSimulation,UserResults,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\UserResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: true_positives' false_positives' false_negatives' max_errors' current_total_error' PrecRel_at_k
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UserSimulation,ErrorGenerator,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\ErrorGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ErrorGenerator' Utility
Broken Modularization,UserSimulation,PrepData,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\PrepData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dag' original_inputs' correct_outputs' terminal_input_nodes' terminal_formula_nodes
Insufficient Modularization,UserSimulation,Simulation,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\Simulation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Modularization,UserSimulation,UserResults,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\UserSimulation\UserResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' true_positives' false_positives' false_negatives' max_errors' current_total_error' PrecRel_at_k
