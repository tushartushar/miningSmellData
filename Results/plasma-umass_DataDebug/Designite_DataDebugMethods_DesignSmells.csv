Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataDebugMethods,ContainsLoopException,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\Analysis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DataDebugMethods,ContainsLoopException,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\Analysis.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataDebugMethods,FunctionOutput,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\FunctionOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataDebugMethods,ProgressMaxUnsetException,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\ProgBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DataDebugMethods,ProgressMaxUnsetException,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\ProgBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataDebugMethods,Utility,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\Utility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExtensionMethods,DataDebugExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DataDebugMethods,NormalDistribution,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\NormalDistribution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _ranked_errors
Insufficient Modularization,DataDebugMethods,DAG,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\DAG.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DataDebugMethods,DAG,D:\newReposJune17\plasma-umass_DataDebug\DataDebugMethods\DAG.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
