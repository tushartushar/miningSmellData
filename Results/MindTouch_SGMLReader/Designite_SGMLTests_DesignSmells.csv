Unutilized Abstraction,SGMLTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SGMLTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Tests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\Tests.cs' [1' 23])' XmlRender (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\Tests-Logic.cs' [1' 23])' LoggingXmlReader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\LoggingXmlReader.cs' [1' 23])

Insufficient Modularization,SGMLTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 63 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SGMLTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MindTouch_SGMLReader\SGMLTests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 66 methods
