Duplicate Abstraction,NSubstitute.Benchmarks,DispatchConfiguredMatchingCallBenchmark,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\DispatchConfiguredMatchingCallBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DispatchConfiguredMatchingCallBenchmark (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\DispatchConfiguredMatchingCallBenchmark.cs' [19' 39])' DispatchConfiguredNonMatchingCallBenchmark (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\DispatchConfiguredNonMatchingCallBenchmark.cs' [19' 39])
Unutilized Abstraction,NSubstitute.Benchmarks,DispatchConfiguredNonMatchingCallBenchmark,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\DispatchConfiguredNonMatchingCallBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSubstitute.Benchmarks,DispatchNonConfiguredCallBenchmark,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\DispatchNonConfiguredCallBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSubstitute.Benchmarks,ToStringCallBenchmark,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\ToStringCallBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Rebellious Hierarchy,NSubstitute.Benchmarks.TestTypes,ClassWithToStringImplementation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nsubstitute_NSubstitute\tests\NSubstitute.Benchmarks\TestTypes\ClassWithToStringImplementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
