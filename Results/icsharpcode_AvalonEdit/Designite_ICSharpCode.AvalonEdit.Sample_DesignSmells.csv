Unutilized Abstraction,ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample,BraceFoldingStrategy,F:\newReposMay17\icsharpcode_AvalonEdit\ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample\BraceFoldingStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample,BraceFoldingStrategy,F:\newReposMay17\icsharpcode_AvalonEdit\ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample\BraceFoldingStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BraceFoldingStrategy[1' 20]' Window1[1' 20]
Unutilized Abstraction,ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample,Window1,F:\newReposMay17\icsharpcode_AvalonEdit\ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Missing Hierarchy,ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample,Window1,F:\newReposMay17\icsharpcode_AvalonEdit\ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Sample\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: BraceFoldingStrategy' XmlFoldingStrategy (in method "UpdateFoldings" of class "Window1").
