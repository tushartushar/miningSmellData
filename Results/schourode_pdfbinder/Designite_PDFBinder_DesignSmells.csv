Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,PDFBinder,Combiner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\Binder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Combiner (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\Binder.cs' [1' 20])' ProcessLinker (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\IpcHelper.cs' [1' 20])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\Program.cs' [1' 20])' ShellInstaller (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\ShellInstaller.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,PDFBinder,ShellInstaller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\ShellInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PDFBinder.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PDFBinder,ProcessLinker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schourode_pdfbinder\src\PDFBinder\IpcHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PDFBinder.ProcessLinker' PDFBinder.Program
