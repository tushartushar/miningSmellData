Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility,Capture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\Capture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility,PackageUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\PackageUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility,PackageUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\PackageUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PackageUtility (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\PackageUtility.cs' [44' 65])' PackageUtility (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\PackageUtility.cs' [109' 130])
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks,MockSharedPackageRepository2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\Mocks\MockSharedPackageRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks,MockFileSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\Mocks\MockFileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks,MockPackageCacheRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\Mocks\MockPackageCacheRepository.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks.MockPackageRepository
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks,MockProjectSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\Mocks\MockProjectSystem.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks.MockFileSystem
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks,MockServiceBasePackageRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.TestUtility\Mocks\MockServiceBasePackageRepository.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStackVS.TestUtility.Mocks.MockPackageRepository
