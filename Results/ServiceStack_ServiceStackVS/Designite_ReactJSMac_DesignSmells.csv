Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,,NativeHostAction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\AppHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Action
Unutilized Abstraction,,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MainWindowController
Deficient Encapsulation,,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MainWindowController
Deficient Encapsulation,,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HostUrl' App' MainMenu
Deficient Encapsulation,,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: HostUrl' App' MainMenu
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,,AppHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSMac\AppHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: .AppHost' .Program' .NativeHost' .NativeHostService
