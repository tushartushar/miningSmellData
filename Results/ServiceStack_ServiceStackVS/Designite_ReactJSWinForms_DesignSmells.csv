Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,,NativeHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\NativeHost.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Quit which is more interested in members of the type: FormMain
Feature Envy,,NativeHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\NativeHost.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ToggleFormBorder which is more interested in members of the type: FormMain
Unnecessary Abstraction,,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HostUrl' AppHost' Form
Deficient Encapsulation,,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: HostUrl' AppHost' Form
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,,FormMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: .FormMain' .NativeHost
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: .Program' .FormMain
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,,NativeHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStackVS\src\ServiceStackVS.Archive\ProjectTemplates\ReactJSGap\ReactJSWinForms\NativeHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
