Unnecessary Abstraction,Tmx,AddTLTestSubSuiteCommand,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Commands\TL\AddTLTestSubSuiteCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tmx,TestLinkFactory,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Helpers\UnderlyingCode\TestLinkFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Tmx,TestLinkFactory,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Helpers\UnderlyingCode\TestLinkFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tmx,WrappedTestLink,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Helpers\UnderlyingCode\Wrappers\WrappedTestLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tmx,TLAddinData,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Helpers\UserSettings\TLAddinData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CurrentTestLinkConnection' CurrentTestProject' CurrentTestPlan' CurrentTestSuite
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tmx,AddTLTestCaseCommand,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Commands\TL\AddTLTestCaseCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AddTLTestCaseCommand' TLSrvAddTestCaseCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tmx,GetTLTestCaseCommand,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Commands\TL\GetTLTestCaseCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GetTLTestCaseCommand' TLSrvGetTestCaseCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tmx,NewTLUserCommand,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Commands\TL\NewTLUserCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NewTLUserCommand' TLSrvNewUserCommand
Unfactored Hierarchy,Tmx,TLTestCaseCmdletBase,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Helpers\Inheritance\TLTestCaseCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: TLTestCaseCmdletBase[20' 39]' TLTestSuiteCmdletBase[20' 39]
Wide Hierarchy,Tmx,TLSrvCommand,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Tmx\Addins\TLAddin\Helpers\UnderlyingCode\Commands\TLSrvCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: TLSrvAddBuildCommand' TLSrvGetBuildCommand' TLSrvConnectCommand' TLSrvAddTestCaseCommand' TLSrvGetTestCaseCommand' TLSrvGetTestPlanCommand' TLSrvNewTestPlanCommand' TLSrvGetProjectCommand' TLSrvAddTestSuiteCommand' TLSrvGetTestSuiteCommand' TLSrvNewUserCommand
