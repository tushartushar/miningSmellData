Unutilized Abstraction,Data.Commands,GetDtSomethingCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Commands\SQL\GetDtSomethingCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Data,IXMLDataEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Helpers\UnderlyingCode\Interfaces\IXMLDataEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: XPath' Value' Result
Insufficient Modularization,Data,CommonCmdletBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Helpers\Inheritance\CommonCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Data.Commands,AddDtXmlDataEntryCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Commands\XML\AddDtXmlDataEntryCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Data.Commands.AddDtXmlDataEntryCommand' Data.DtAddXmlDataEntryCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Data.Commands,CompareDtXmlDataCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Commands\XML\CompareDtXmlDataCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Data.Commands.CompareDtXmlDataCommand' Data.DtCompareXmlDataCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Data.Commands,ImportDtXmlFileCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Commands\XML\ImportDtXmlFileCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Data.Commands.ImportDtXmlFileCommand' Data.DtImportXmlFileCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Data.Commands,NewDtXmlComparerCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Commands\XML\NewDtXmlComparerCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Data.Commands.NewDtXmlComparerCommand' Data.DtNewXmlComparerCommand
Rebellious Hierarchy,Data,CommonCmdletBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\Data\Data\Helpers\Inheritance\CommonCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteCollection' BeforeWriteSingleObject' AfterWriteSingleObject' AfterWriteCollection' AfterWriteCollection' AfterWriteCollection' AfterWriteCollection' AfterWriteCollection' AfterWriteCollection' AfterWriteCollection
