Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tmx,TFTestPlanCmdletBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\TMX\Addins\TFAddin\Helpers\Inheritance\TFTestPlanCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tmx,CurrentData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\TMX\Addins\TFAddin\Helpers\UserSettings\CurrentData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CurrentServer' CurrentCollection' CurrentProject' CurrentTestPlan
Unutilized Abstraction,TFAddinUnitTests.Commands.TF,NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\TMX\Addins\TFAddinUnitTests\Commands\TF\NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TFAddinUnitTests.Commands.TF,NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\TMX\Addins\TFAddinUnitTests\Commands\TF\NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: TFAddinUnitTests.Commands.TF.NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture' TFAddinUnitTests.ParamChecks.TF.NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture
Unutilized Abstraction,TFAddinUnitTests.ParamChecks.TF,NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\TMX\Addins\TFAddinUnitTests\ParamChecks\TF\NewTFBuildCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TFAddinUnitTests,FakeTfsFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\apetrovskiy_STUPS\TMX\Addins\TFAddinUnitTests\UnitTests\Fakes\FakeTfsFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
