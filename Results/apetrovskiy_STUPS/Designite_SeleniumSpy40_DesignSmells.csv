Imperative Abstraction,UIAutomationSpy,SpyForm,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\SePSX\SeleniumSpy40\..\SeleniumSpy\SpyForm.SeleniumCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessSpyingCycle
Unutilized Abstraction,UIAutomationSpy,SpyForm,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\SePSX\SeleniumSpy40\..\SeleniumSpy\SpyForm.SeleniumCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,UIAutomationSpy,SpyForm,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\SePSX\SeleniumSpy40\..\SeleniumSpy\SpyForm.SeleniumCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SpyForm[48' 1285]' SpyTabs[1' 1238]
Insufficient Modularization,UIAutomationSpy,SpyForm,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\SePSX\SeleniumSpy40\..\SeleniumSpy\SpyForm.SeleniumCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Insufficient Modularization,UIAutomationSpy,SpyForm,F:\newReposMay17\apetrovskiy_STUPS\SePSX\SeleniumSpy40\..\SeleniumSpy\SpyForm.SeleniumCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 113
