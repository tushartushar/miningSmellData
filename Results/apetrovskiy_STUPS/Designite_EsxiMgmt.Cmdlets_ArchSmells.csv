Cyclic Dependency,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands.Connect,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands.Connect' EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Connect
Cyclic Dependency,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands' EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Register
Cyclic Dependency,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands' EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Vm
Cyclic Dependency,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands.Vm,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands.Vm' EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Vm
Unstable Dependency,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands.Connect,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Connect
Unstable Dependency,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Register' EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Helpers.UnderlyingCode.Commands.Vm

Feature Concentration,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets,EsxiMgmt.Cmdlets.Commands,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [NewESXiFSDirectoryCommand]' [ReadESXiVMIdCommand]' [ReadESXiVMNameCommand]' [RegisterESXiVMCommand]' [UnregisterESXiVMCommand]' [StopESXiVMCommand]' [SuspendESXiVMCommand]' [GetEsxiVmCommand]' [NewEsxiVmCommand].
