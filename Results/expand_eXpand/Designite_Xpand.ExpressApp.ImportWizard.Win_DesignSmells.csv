(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Xpand.ExpressApp.ImportWizard.Win,Updater,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\expand_eXpand\Xpand\Xpand.ExpressApp.Modules\ImportWizard.Win\Updater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Xpand.ExpressApp.ImportWizard.Win,ImportWizardWindowsFormsModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\expand_eXpand\Xpand\Xpand.ExpressApp.Modules\ImportWizard.Win\WinModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xpand.ExpressApp.ImportWizard.Win.Wizard,ResourceManagerSetter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\expand_eXpand\Xpand\Xpand.ExpressApp.Modules\ImportWizard.Win\Wizard\ResourceManagerSetter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,Xpand.ExpressApp.ImportWizard.Win.Wizard,StringValueMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\expand_eXpand\Xpand\Xpand.ExpressApp.Modules\ImportWizard.Win\Wizard\StringValueMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MapValueToObjectProperty
Deficient Encapsulation,Xpand.ExpressApp.ImportWizard.Win.Wizard,ExcelImportWizard,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\expand_eXpand\Xpand\Xpand.ExpressApp.Modules\ImportWizard.Win\Wizard\ExcelImportWizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MappingGrid' ResultsMemoEdit' TransactionSize
Deficient Encapsulation,Xpand.ExpressApp.ImportWizard.Win.Wizard,ExcelImportWizard,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\expand_eXpand\Xpand\Xpand.ExpressApp.Modules\ImportWizard.Win\Wizard\ExcelImportWizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields.
