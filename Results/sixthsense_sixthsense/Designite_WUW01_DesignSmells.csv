Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestList,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestList,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestResult,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestResult,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,PointR,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\PointR.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' T
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,Category,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Category.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.Category' WUW01.GeometricRecognizer' WUW01.Gesture
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,Category,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Category.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.Category' WUW01.GeometricRecognizer' WUW01.Gesture
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,GeometricRecognizer,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\DollarRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.GeometricRecognizer' WUW01.Gesture
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,GeometricRecognizer,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\DollarRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.GeometricRecognizer' WUW01.Gesture' WUW01.Category
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,Gesture,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Gesture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.Gesture' WUW01.GeometricRecognizer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,Gesture,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Gesture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Insufficient Modularization,WUW01,Utils,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WUW01,WUW,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\WUW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 105 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WUW01,WUW,C:\repos\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\WUW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 231
