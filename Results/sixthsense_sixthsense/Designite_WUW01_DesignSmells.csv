Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,WUW01,WUW,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\WUW.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: btnView_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ViewForm
Feature Envy,WUW01,WUW,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\WUW.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ReloadViewForm which is more interested in members of the type: ViewForm
Unnecessary Abstraction,WUW01.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,GeometricRecognizer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\DollarRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tolerance
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,Gesture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Gesture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' RawPoints' Points
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,NBestResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\NBestList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,WUW01,PointR,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\PointR.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' T
Insufficient Modularization,WUW01,Utils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WUW01,WUW,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\WUW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 105 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WUW01,WUW,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\WUW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 290
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,GeometricRecognizer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\DollarRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.GeometricRecognizer' WUW01.Gesture
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,RectangleR,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\RectangleR.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.RectangleR' WUW01.Utils
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WUW01,Category,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sixthsense_sixthsense\WUW01\classes\Category.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WUW01.Category' WUW01.GeometricRecognizer' WUW01.Gesture
