Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Worker.Common,ElasticsearchWorker.Data,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ElasticsearchWorker.Data' ElasticsearchWorker.Core,ElasticsearchWorker.Data.DataBootstrapService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchManager,ElasticsearchWorker.Data.DataBootstrapService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchManager
Unstable Dependency,Worker.Common,ElasticsearchWorker.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ElasticsearchWorker.Data,ElasticsearchWorker.Core.DataBootstrapService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.IDataBootstrapper,ElasticsearchWorker.Core.DataBootstrapService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.IDataBootstrapper
Feature Concentration,Worker.Common,ElasticsearchWorker.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ElasticsearchService' IElasticsearchServiceSettings' ElasticsearchManager' JavaManager' SoftwareManager' ElasticsearchServiceSettings' MEMORYSTATUSEX]' [ElasticsearchNode]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchNode,ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchService' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchServiceSettings' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.MEMORYSTATUSEX' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.IElasticsearchServiceSettings' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchManager' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.ElasticsearchNode' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.JavaManager' ElasticsearchWorker.Core.SoftwareManager
