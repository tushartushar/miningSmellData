Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8,JsEngineFactoryCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Taritsyn_JavaScriptEngineSwitcher\src\JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8\JsEngineFactoryCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8,V8JsEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Taritsyn_JavaScriptEngineSwitcher\src\JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8\V8JsEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unnecessary Abstraction,JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8.Constants,DllName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Taritsyn_JavaScriptEngineSwitcher\src\JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8\Constants\DllName.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ClearScriptV8Universal' V8LibCpp32Bit' V8LibCpp64Bit
Insufficient Modularization,JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8,V8JsEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Taritsyn_JavaScriptEngineSwitcher\src\JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8\V8JsEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8,V8JsEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Taritsyn_JavaScriptEngineSwitcher\src\JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8\V8JsEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8.V8JsEngine' JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8.V8PrecompiledScript
