Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,ARSS,ARSS,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ARSS' ArssSpectrogram,ARSS.Tests' ArssSpectrogram.SpectrogramUtils,ARSS.Tests' ArssSpectrogram.SpectrogramUtils
Feature Concentration,ARSS,ARSS,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Arss' Mode' DSP' FFTMethod' ImageIO' SoundIO' Util]' [Tests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,ARSS.Tests,ARSS.Arss' ARSS.Mode' ARSS.DSP' ARSS.FFTMethod' ARSS.ImageIO' ARSS.SoundIO' ARSS.Tests' ARSS.Util
