Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ARSS,Tests,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\Tests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ArssSpectrogram,SynthesisType,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\ArssSpectrogram\Spectrogram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SynthesisType (C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\ArssSpectrogram\Spectrogram.cs' [279' 310])' SynthesisType (C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\ArssSpectrogram\Spectrogram.cs' [345' 376])
Unutilized Abstraction,ArssSpectrogram,Pair<T;U>,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\ArssSpectrogram\Spectrogram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ArssSpectrogram,Spectrogram,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\ArssSpectrogram\Spectrogram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,ARSS,Arss,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\Arss.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: version' date
Deficient Encapsulation,ARSS,Arss,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\Arss.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: version' date
Deficient Encapsulation,ARSS,DSP,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\DSP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PI' LOGBASE' LOOP_SIZE_SEC' BMSQ_LUT_SIZE' clockA
Deficient Encapsulation,ARSS,DSP,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\DSP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PI' LOGBASE' LOOP_SIZE_SEC' BMSQ_LUT_SIZE' clockA
Deficient Encapsulation,ARSS,Util,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: quiet
Deficient Encapsulation,ARSS,Util,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: quiet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ARSS,DSP,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\DSP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ARSS.DSP' ARSS.Util
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ARSS,Util,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ARSS.Util' ARSS.DSP
Insufficient Modularization,ArssSpectrogram,SpectrogramUtils,C:\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\ARSSCSharp\ArssSpectrogram\SpectrogramUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
