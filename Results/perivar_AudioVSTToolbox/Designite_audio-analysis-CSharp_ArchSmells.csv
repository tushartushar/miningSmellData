Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Feature Concentration,audio-analysis-CSharp,com.badlogic.audio.analysis,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DFT' FourierTransform' FFT' SpectrumProvider]' [Signals]' [ThresholdFunction]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,com.badlogic.audio.analysis.Signals' com.badlogic.audio.analysis.ThresholdFunction
Scattered Functionality,audio-analysis-CSharp,com.badlogic.audio.samples.part6,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: com.badlogic.audio.analysis' com.badlogic.audio.visualization,com.badlogic.audio.analysis.FourierTransform' com.badlogic.audio.analysis.FFT' com.badlogic.audio.visualization.Plot' com.badlogic.audio.analysis.SpectrumProvider
