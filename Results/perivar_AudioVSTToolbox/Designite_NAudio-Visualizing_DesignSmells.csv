Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,NAudio_Visualizing,CustomSpectrumAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\CustomSpectrumAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RegisterSoundPlayer
Unutilized Abstraction,NAudio_Visualizing,CustomSpectrumAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\CustomSpectrumAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CommonUtils.GUI,CustomWaveViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\CustomWaveViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,CommonUtils.GUI,CustomWaveViewer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\CustomWaveViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PointInLoopRegion which is more interested in members of the type: IWaveformPlayer
Unnecessary Abstraction,CommonUtils.Audio,ISoundPlayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\ISoundPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsPlaying' SampleRate
Duplicate Abstraction,CommonUtils.Audio,ISoundPlayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\ISoundPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ISoundPlayer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\ISoundPlayer.cs' [1' 20])' ISpectrumPlayer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\ISpectrumPlayer.cs' [1' 20])' IWaveformPlayer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\IWaveformPlayer.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,CommonUtils.Audio,IWaveformPlayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\IWaveformPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ChannelPosition' ChannelLength' WaveformData' SelectionBegin' SelectionEnd
Deficient Encapsulation,NAudio_Visualizing,CustomSpectrumAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\CustomSpectrumAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BarHeightScaling' IsFrequencyScaleLinear' AveragePeaks' PeakFallDelay' BarSpacing' BarCount' MaximumFrequency' MinimumFrequency' ActualBarWidth' DoSpectrumGraph
Broken Modularization,CommonUtils.Audio,IWaveformPlayer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perivar_AudioVSTToolbox\NAudio-Visualizing\IWaveformPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ChannelPosition' ChannelLength' WaveformData' SelectionBegin' SelectionEnd
