Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NetworkPLCSim,NetworkPLCSim,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\NetworkPLCSim\NetworkPLCSim.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kopplungstester,TCPFunctions,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\NetworkPLCSim\TCPFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Kopplungstester,TCPFunctions,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\NetworkPLCSim\TCPFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TCPFunctions (C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\NetworkPLCSim\TCPFunctions.cs' [271' 290])' TCPFunctions (C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\NetworkPLCSim\TCPFunctions.cs' [404' 423])
Unnecessary Abstraction,NetworkPLCSim.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\NetworkPLCSim\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
