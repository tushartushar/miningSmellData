Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,WPFToolboxForSiemensPLCs.AvalonEdit,BraceFoldingStrategy,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\AvalonEdit\BraceFoldingStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WPFToolboxForSiemensPLCs.AvalonEdit,TextColorizer,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\AvalonEdit\TextColorizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,S7ProjectBlockComparer,MainWindow,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitializeComponent
Unutilized Abstraction,S7ProjectBlockComparer,MainWindow,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DiffMatchPatch,CompatibilityExtensions,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,S7ProjectBlockComparer.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,DiffMatchPatch,Diff,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: operation' text
Deficient Encapsulation,DiffMatchPatch,Patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: diffs' start1' start2' length1' length2
Deficient Encapsulation,DiffMatchPatch,diff_match_patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Diff_Timeout' Diff_EditCost' Match_Threshold' Match_Distance' Patch_DeleteThreshold' Patch_Margin
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DiffMatchPatch,Patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DiffMatchPatch.Patch' DiffMatchPatch.diff_match_patch
Insufficient Modularization,DiffMatchPatch,diff_match_patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DiffMatchPatch,diff_match_patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DiffMatchPatch,diff_match_patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 196
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DiffMatchPatch,diff_match_patch,C:\repos\jogibear9988_DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary\S7ProjectBlockComparer\DiffMatchPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DiffMatchPatch.diff_match_patch' DiffMatchPatch.Patch
