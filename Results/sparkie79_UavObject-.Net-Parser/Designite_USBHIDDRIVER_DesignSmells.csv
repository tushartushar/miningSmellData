List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: USBInterface[1' 23]' ListWithEvent[1' 23]
Unutilized Abstraction,USBHIDDRIVER.TESTS,USBTestFixture,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\TESTS\TestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,HidApiDeclarations,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\HidDeclarations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HidApiDeclarations[1' 22]' USBSharp[1' 22]
Multifaceted Abstraction,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,HIDUSBDevice,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\HIDUSBDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Multifaceted Abstraction,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,USBSharp,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\USBSharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Deficient Encapsulation,USBHIDDRIVER,USBInterface,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: usbBuffer
Deficient Encapsulation,USBHIDDRIVER,USBInterface,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: usbBuffer
Deficient Encapsulation,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,HIDUSBDevice,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\HIDUSBDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: byteCount
Deficient Encapsulation,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,USBSharp,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\USBSharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HidHandle' hDevInfo' DevicePathName' mySP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA' myPSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA' myHIDD_ATTRIBUTES' myHIDP_CAPS' myHIDP_VALUE_CAPS
Insufficient Modularization,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,USBSharp,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\USBSharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,USBHIDDRIVER.USB,USBSharp,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\USBHIDDRIVER\USB\USBSharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
