Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,UsbLibrary,UsbHidPort,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\UsbHidPort.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,UsbLibrary,Win32Usb,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\Win32Usb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Deficient Encapsulation,UsbLibrary,Win32Usb,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\Win32Usb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NullHandle
Deficient Encapsulation,UsbLibrary,Win32Usb,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\Win32Usb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NullHandle
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UsbLibrary,HIDDevice,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\HIDDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HIDDevice' InputReport
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UsbLibrary,OutputReport,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\Report.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OutputReport' HIDDevice
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UsbLibrary,OutputReport,C:\repos\sparkie79_UavObject-.Net-Parser\UsbLibrary\Report.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OutputReport' HIDDevice' InputReport' HIDDevice
