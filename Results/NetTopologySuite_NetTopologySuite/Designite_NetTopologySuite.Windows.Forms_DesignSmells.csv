Duplicate Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs' [1' 42])' GraphicsPathWriter (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GraphicsPathWriter.cs' [1' 42])
Duplicate Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GeometryCollectionGraphicsPath.cs' [1' 33])' IdentityPointTransformation (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\IdentityPointTransformation.cs' [1' 33])' IPointShapeFactory (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs' [1' 33])' GraphicsPathWriter (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GraphicsPathWriter.cs' [1' 33])' IPointTransformation (C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\IPointTransformation.cs' [1' 33])

Imperative Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,GraphicsPathWriter,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\GraphicsPathWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToShape
Deficient Encapsulation,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,BasePointShapeFactory,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultSize
Deficient Encapsulation,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,BasePointShapeFactory,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultSize
Rebellious Hierarchy,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,BasePointShapeFactory,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreatePoint
Broken Hierarchy,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms,Dot,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms\PointGraphicsPathFactory.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NetTopologySuite.Windows.Forms.Square
