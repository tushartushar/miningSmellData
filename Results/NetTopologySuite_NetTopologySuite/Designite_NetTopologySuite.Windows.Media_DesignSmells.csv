Unnecessary Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Media,IPointShapeFactory,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Media\PointToStreamGeometryFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Media,PolygonWpfStreamGeometry,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Media\PolygonWpfStreamGeometry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NetTopologySuite.Windows.Media,WpfPathGeometryWriter,C:\repos\NetTopologySuite_NetTopologySuite\NetTopologySuite.Windows.Media\WpfPathGeometryWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToShape
