Feature Envy,TeamCitySharp.IntegrationTests,when_connecting_to_the_teamcity_server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stack72_TeamCitySharp\src\Tests\IntegrationTests\SampleConnectionUsage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: it_will_authenticate_a_known_user which is more interested in members of the type: ITeamCityClient
