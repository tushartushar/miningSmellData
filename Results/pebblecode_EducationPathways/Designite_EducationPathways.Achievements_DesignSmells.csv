Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,PubNub_Messaging,Pubnub,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.97
Duplicate Abstraction,PubNub_Messaging,Pubnub,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Pubnub[2631' 2651]' Pubnub[2666' 2686]
Multifaceted Abstraction,PubNub_Messaging,MD5,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Deficient Encapsulation,PubNub_Messaging,ReconnectState,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: channel' type' callback' connectCallback' timetoken
Deficient Encapsulation,PubNub_Messaging,RequestState,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: request' response' type' channel
Deficient Encapsulation,PubNub_Messaging,InternetState,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: callback' ipaddr
Insufficient Modularization,PubNub_Messaging,Pubnub,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PubNub_Messaging,Pubnub,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 84 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PubNub_Messaging,Pubnub,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 330
Broken Hierarchy,PubNub_Messaging,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MD5
Cyclic Hierarchy,PubNub_Messaging,MD5,C:\repos\pebblecode_EducationPathways\EducationPathways.Achievements\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MD5CryptoServiceProvider
