Unnecessary Abstraction,DataCat,Class1,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DataCat,Class1,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DataCat.Connection,StoredProcedure,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Connection\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: StoredProcedure[243' 264]' StoredProcedure[271' 292]' StoredProcedure[299' 320]' StoredProcedure[327' 348]
Unutilized Abstraction,DataCat.Controls,ClientLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\ClientLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataCat.Controls,ListData,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\Controls.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DataCat.Controls,dlgClientLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\dlgClientLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: dlgClientLookup[66' 85]' dlgPersonLookup[70' 89]' dlgProjectLookup[77' 96]' dlgUserLookup[39' 58]
Unutilized Abstraction,DataCat.Controls,PersonLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\PersonLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataCat.Controls,ProjectLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\ProjectLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataCat.Controls,UserLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\UserLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DataCat.Controls,ClientLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\ClientLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentSelectedClient
Deficient Encapsulation,DataCat.Controls,PersonLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\PersonLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentSelectedPerson
Deficient Encapsulation,DataCat.Controls,ProjectLookup,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Controls\ProjectLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentSelectedProject
Deficient Encapsulation,DataCat.Utilities,ComboBoxItem,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Utilities\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: displayValue
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataCat.Connection,StoredProcedure,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Connection\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StoredProcedure' Connection
Broken Hierarchy,DataCat.Utilities,ComboBoxItemWithParent,C:\repos\nicopretorius_datacat-main\DataCat-Core\Utilities\Utilities.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ComboBoxItem
