Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoTorrent.Exceptions,MessageException,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Exceptions\MessageException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoTorrent,TorrentException,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\TorrentException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoTorrent,RawTrackerTiers,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\RawTrackerTiers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,MonoTorrent,Torrent,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Torrent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BEncodedString' BEncodedList' BEncodedList (in method "LoadInternal" of class "Torrent").
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent.Messages,Message,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Messages\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent,BitField,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\BitField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent,Check,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Check.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent,Check,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Check.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MonoTorrent.BEncoding,RawReader,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\BEncoding\RawReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,MonoTorrent.Messages,Message,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Messages\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Decode' Encode
Missing Hierarchy,MonoTorrent,Torrent,C:\repos\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\MonoTorrent\Torrent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: BEncodedString' BEncodingException (in method "LoadInternal" of class "Torrent").
