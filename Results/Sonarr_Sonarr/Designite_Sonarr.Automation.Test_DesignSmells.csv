Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,AutomationTestAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\AutomationTestAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: series_page which is more interested in members of the type: PageBase
Feature Envy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: calendar_page which is more interested in members of the type: PageBase
Feature Envy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: activity_page which is more interested in members of the type: PageBase
Feature Envy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: wanted_page which is more interested in members of the type: PageBase
Feature Envy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: system_page which is more interested in members of the type: PageBase
Feature Envy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: add_series_page which is more interested in members of the type: PageBase
Broken Hierarchy,NzbDrone.Automation.Test,MainPagesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Automation.Test\MainPagesTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NzbDrone.Automation.Test.AutomationTest
