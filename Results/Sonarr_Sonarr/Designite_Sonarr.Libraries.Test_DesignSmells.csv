Unnecessary Abstraction,NzbDrone.Libraries.Test.JsonTests,TypeWithNumbers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Libraries.Test\JsonTests\JsonFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Int32' Int64' nullableIntIsNull' nullableWithValue
Broken Hierarchy,NzbDrone.Libraries.Test.JsonTests,JsonFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Libraries.Test\JsonTests\JsonFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NzbDrone.Test.Common.TestBase
Broken Hierarchy,NzbDrone.Libraries.Test,RuntimeInformationFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sonarr_Sonarr\src\NzbDrone.Libraries.Test\RuntimeInformationFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NzbDrone.Test.Common.TestBase
