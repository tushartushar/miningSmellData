Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Helios.MultiNodeTests,TcpClientServerReplyTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helios-io_helios\tests\Helios.MultiNodeTests\ClientServerReplyTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TransportType
Unnecessary Abstraction,Helios.MultiNodeTests,TcpLargeMessageTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helios-io_helios\tests\Helios.MultiNodeTests\LargeMessageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TransportType
Feature Envy,Helios.MultiNodeTests.TestKit,MultiNodeTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helios-io_helios\tests\Helios.MultiNodeTests\TestKit\MultiNodeTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StartServer which is more interested in members of the type: IConnection
Broken Hierarchy,Helios.MultiNodeTests,ClientServerReplyTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helios-io_helios\tests\Helios.MultiNodeTests\ClientServerReplyTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Helios.MultiNodeTests.TestKit.MultiNodeTest
