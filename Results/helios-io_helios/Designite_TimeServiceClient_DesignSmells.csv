Feature Envy,TimeServiceClient,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helios-io_helios\samples\TimeService\TimeServiceClient\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoopWrite which is more interested in members of the type: IConnection
