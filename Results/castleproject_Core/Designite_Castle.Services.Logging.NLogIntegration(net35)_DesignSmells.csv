Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.NLogIntegration,NLogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.NLogIntegration\NLogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 45 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.NLogIntegration,NLogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.NLogIntegration\NLogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 52 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.NLogIntegration,ExtendedNLogFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.NLogIntegration\ExtendedNLogFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
