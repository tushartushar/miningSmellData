Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration,SerilogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration\SerilogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 45 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration,SerilogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration\SerilogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration,SerilogFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration\SerilogFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration.SerilogFactory' Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration.SerilogLogger
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration,SerilogFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration\SerilogFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration,SerilogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.SerilogIntegration\SerilogLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateChildLogger
