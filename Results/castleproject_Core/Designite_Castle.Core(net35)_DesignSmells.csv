Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST,SelfReference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Core\DynamicProxy\Generators\Emitters\SimpleAST\SelfReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LoadAddressOfReference
Wide Hierarchy,Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST,Statement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Core\DynamicProxy\Generators\Emitters\SimpleAST\Statement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.AssignArgumentStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.AssignArrayStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.AssignStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.ConstructorInvocationStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.EndExceptionBlockStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.ExpressionStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.FinallyStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.NopStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.ReturnStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.ThrowStatement' Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.TryStatement
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST,Statement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Core\DynamicProxy\Generators\Emitters\SimpleAST\Statement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Emit
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST,TypeReference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Core\DynamicProxy\Generators\Emitters\SimpleAST\TypeReference.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.SimpleAST.Reference
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.DynamicProxy.Internal,InheritanceInvocation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Core\DynamicProxy\Internal\InheritanceInvocation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: InvokeMethodOnTarget
