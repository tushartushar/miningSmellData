Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,GlobalContextProperties,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\GlobalContextProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,GlobalContextProperties,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\GlobalContextProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GlobalContextProperties[1' 20]' ThreadContextProperties[1' 20]' ThreadContextStacks[1' 20]
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ExtendedLog4netLogger,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ExtendedLog4netLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ExtendedLog4netLogger[1' 20]' ThreadContextStack[1' 20]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ThreadContextProperties,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ThreadContextProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ThreadContextStack,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ThreadContextStack.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ThreadContextStacks,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ThreadContextStacks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ExtendedLog4netFactory,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ExtendedLog4netFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExtendedLog4netFactory' ExtendedLog4netLogger
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,Log4netFactory,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\Log4netFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Log4netFactory' Log4netLogger
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,Log4netLogger,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\Log4netLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,Log4netLogger,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\Log4netLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ExtendedLog4netFactory,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ExtendedLog4netFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
Unfactored Hierarchy,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,ExtendedLog4netFactory,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\ExtendedLog4netFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ExtendedLog4netFactory[1' 24]' Log4netFactory[1' 24]
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration,Log4netFactory,F:\newReposMay17\castleproject_Core\src\Castle.Services.Logging.log4netIntegration\Log4netFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
