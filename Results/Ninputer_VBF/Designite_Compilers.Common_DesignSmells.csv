Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,VBF.Compilers,CodeContract,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\CodeContract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CodeContract (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\CodeContract.cs' [1' 20])' SourceLocation (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\SourceLocation.cs' [1' 20])' SourceSpan (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\SourceSpan.cs' [1' 20])' CompilationErrorInfoCollection (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\CompilationErrorInfoCollection.cs' [1' 20])' RevertPointCollection (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\RevertPointCollection.cs' [1' 20])
Feature Envy,VBF.Compilers,CompilationErrorManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\CompilationErrorManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DefineError which is more interested in members of the type: CompilationErrorInfoCollection
Unutilized Abstraction,VBF.Compilers,SourceReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\SourceReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VBF.Compilers.Common,DepthFirstSearch<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\DepthFirstSearch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,VBF.Compilers.Common,DFSInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\DepthFirstSearch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ComponentNumber' PostIndex' PreIndex' PrevNodeIndex
Unutilized Abstraction,VBF.Compilers.Common,DisjointSets<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\DisjointSets.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,VBF.Compilers.Common,DisjointSets<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\DisjointSets.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DisjointSets<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\DisjointSets.cs' [1' 21])' ExtremeType (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\PriorityQueue.cs' [1' 21])
Unutilized Abstraction,VBF.Compilers.Common,PriorityQueue<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\PriorityQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,VBF.Compilers.Common,StringHelpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\StringHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,VBF.Compilers.Common,DFSInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\Common\DepthFirstSearch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ComponentNumber' PostIndex' PreIndex' PrevNodeIndex
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VBF.Compilers,CompilationErrorList,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ninputer_VBF\src\Compilers\Compilers.Common\CompilationErrorList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VBF.Compilers.CompilationErrorList' VBF.Compilers.CompilationErrorManager
