Unutilized Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,ContentItemTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\ContentItemTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,JsonLdObjectTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\JsonLdObjectTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,RoleTestObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\JsonLdObjectTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Roles
Unutilized Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,LtiRequestShould,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\LtiRequestShould.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,NameValueCollectionShould,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\NameValueCollectionShould.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,ToolConsumerProfileTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\ToolConsumerProfileTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests.SimpleHelpers,ObjectDiffPatchResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\SimpleHelpers\ObjectDiffPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AreEqual' Type' OldValues' NewValues
Unutilized Abstraction,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests.SimpleHelpers,ObjectDiffPatchJTokenComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\SimpleHelpers\ObjectDiffPatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests,LtiRequestShould,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\LtiRequestShould.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests.TestHelpers,TestLtiRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andyfmiller_LtiLibrary\test\LtiLibrary.NetCore.Tests\TestHelpers\TestLtiRequest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LtiLibrary.NetCore.Lti.v1.LtiRequest
