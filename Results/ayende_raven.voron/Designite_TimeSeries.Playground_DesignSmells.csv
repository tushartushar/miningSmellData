Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,TimeSeries.Playground,DateTimeSeries,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_raven.voron\Performance.Comparison\TimeSeries.Playground\DateTimeSeries.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ScanRange which is more interested in members of the type: StorageEnvironment
Unnecessary Abstraction,TimeSeries.Playground,PendingEnumerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_raven.voron\Performance.Comparison\TimeSeries.Playground\DateTimeSeries.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Enumerator' Index
Unnecessary Abstraction,TimeSeries.Playground,RangeEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_raven.voron\Performance.Comparison\TimeSeries.Playground\DateTimeSeries.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Timestamp' Values
Deficient Encapsulation,TimeSeries.Playground,PendingEnumerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_raven.voron\Performance.Comparison\TimeSeries.Playground\DateTimeSeries.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Enumerator' Index
Deficient Encapsulation,TimeSeries.Playground,RangeEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ayende_raven.voron\Performance.Comparison\TimeSeries.Playground\DateTimeSeries.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Timestamp' Values
