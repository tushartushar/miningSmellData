Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tilde.Its,StorageSize,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\DataCategories\StorageSizeDataCategory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Size' Encoding' LineBreak
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tilde.Its,LocalizationNote,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\DataCategories\LocalizationNoteDataCategory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Note' NoteRef
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tilde.Its,Term,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\DataCategories\TerminologyDataCategory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsTerm' Confidence' Info' InfoRef
Multifaceted Abstraction,Tilde.Its,ItsDocument,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\ItsDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unexloited Encapsulation,Tilde.Its,Annotation,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\DataCategories\Annotation.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ItsXmlDocument' ItsHtmlDocument (in method "XmlOrHtmlDocument" of class "Annotation").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tilde.Its,Annotation,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\DataCategories\Annotation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Annotation' ItsDocument
Broken Hierarchy,Tilde.Its,ItsHtmlDocument,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\ItsHtmlDocument.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ItsDocument
Broken Hierarchy,Tilde.Its,ItsXmlDocument,C:\repos\tilde-nlp_taws\Tilde.Its\ItsXmlDocument.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ItsDocument
