Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Unutilized Abstraction,Dapper,CustomPropertyTypeMap,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Giparus.Osm.Importer,INodeParser,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Importer\INodeParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Giparus.Osm.Importer,IOsmXmlReader,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Importer\IOsmXmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Giparus.Osm.Importer,OsmXmlMongoReader,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Importer\OsmXmlMongoReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Giparus.Osm.Server,Pimp,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Server\Pimp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Giparus.Osm.Importer,OsmXmlMongoReader,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Importer\OsmXmlMongoReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Nodes' Ways' Relations
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 274
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,SqlMapper,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SqlMapper' DynamicParameters
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DynamicParameters,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DynamicParameters' SqlMapper' DefaultTypeMap' SqlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Dapper,DefaultTypeMap,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Dapper\Dapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DefaultTypeMap' SqlMapper
Insufficient Modularization,Giparus.Osm.Importer,OsmXmlMongoReader,C:\repos\Disposer_Giparus\Giparus.Osm\Importer\OsmXmlMongoReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
