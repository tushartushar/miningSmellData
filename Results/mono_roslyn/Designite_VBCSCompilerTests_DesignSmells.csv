Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,CompilerServerUnitTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\CompilerServerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Bug1024619_01 which is more interested in members of the type: TempDirectory
Feature Envy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,CompilerServerUnitTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\CompilerServerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Bug1024619_02 which is more interested in members of the type: TempDirectory
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,RunKeepAliveTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\RunKeepAliveTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ShouldSkip' SkipReason
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,TestableDiagnosticListener,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\CompilerServerApiTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ProcessedCount' LastProcessedTime' KeepAlive
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,CompilerServerUnitTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\CompilerServerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,CompilerServerUnitTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\CompilerServerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 67 methods
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CompilerServer.UnitTests,BuildProtocolTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\BuildProtocolTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Roslyn.Test.Utilities.TestBase
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BuildTasks.UnitTests,CompilerServerApiTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\Core\VBCSCompilerTests\CompilerServerApiTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Roslyn.Test.Utilities.TestBase
