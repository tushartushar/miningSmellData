Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineDiagnosticFormatterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineDiagnosticFormatterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CommandLineTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs' [3628' 3665])' CommandLineTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs' [3670' 3707])
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CommandLineTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs' [4260' 4286])' CommandLineTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs' [4288' 4314])

Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 168 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 189 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Test\CommandLine\CommandLineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 217
