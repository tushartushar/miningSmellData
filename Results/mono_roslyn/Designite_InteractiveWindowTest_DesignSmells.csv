Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Roslyn.Test.Utilities,WaitHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\TestUtilities\Async\WaitHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.InteractiveWindow.UnitTests,InteractiveWindowTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\InteractiveWindow\EditorTest\InteractiveWindowTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.InteractiveWindow.UnitTests,TestContentTypeDefinition,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\InteractiveWindow\EditorTest\TestContentTypeDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ContentTypeName' Definition
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.InteractiveWindow.UnitTests,TestWaitIndicator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\InteractiveWindow\EditorTest\TestWaitIndicator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Roslyn.Test.Utilities,AssertEx,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Test\Utilities\AssertEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.VisualStudio.InteractiveWindow.UnitTests,TestInteractiveEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\InteractiveWindow\EditorTest\TestInteractiveEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AbortCommand
