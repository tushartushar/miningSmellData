Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.ExpressionEvaluator,TypeExtensions,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\CSharp\Source\ResultProvider\Helpers\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis,GreenNode,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\CSharp\Source\ResultProvider\Helpers\Placeholders.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ListKind
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis,GreenNode,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\CSharp\Source\ResultProvider\Helpers\Placeholders.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis,GreenNode,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\CSharp\Source\ResultProvider\Helpers\Placeholders.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.GreenNode' System.Runtime.CompilerServices.GreenNode

Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,SyntaxFacts,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Portable\Parser\CharacterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 67 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,SyntaxFacts,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Portable\Parser\CharacterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 82 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,SyntaxFacts,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Portable\Parser\CharacterInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 146
