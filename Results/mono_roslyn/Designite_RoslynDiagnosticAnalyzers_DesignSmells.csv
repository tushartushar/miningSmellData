Unnecessary Abstraction,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers,DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRule,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' s_localizableTitle' s_localizableMessage' Rule
Unutilized Abstraction,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers,DiagnosticDescriptorAccessAnalyzer<TSyntaxKind;TMemberAccessExpressionSyntax>,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Performance\DiagnosticDescriptorAccessAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.Reliability,MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialize
Unexploited Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.ApiDesign,DeclarePublicAPIAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\ApiDesign\DeclarePublicAPIAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IMethodSymbol' IPropertySymbol' IFieldSymbol (in method "GetPublicApiName" of class "DeclarePublicAPIAnalyzer").
Deficient Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers,DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRule,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Rule
Deficient Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers,DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRule,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Rule
Deficient Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.Reliability,MissingSharedAttributeAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\MissingSharedAttributeAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Rule
Deficient Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.Reliability,MissingSharedAttributeAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\MissingSharedAttributeAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Rule
Deficient Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.Reliability,MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Rule
Deficient Encapsulation,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.Reliability,MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Reliability\MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Rule
Broken Modularization,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers,RoslynDiagnosticIds,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\RoslynDiagnosticIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UseEmptyEnumerableRuleId' UseSingletonEnumerableRuleId' DirectlyAwaitingTaskAnalyzerRuleId' UseSiteDiagnosticsCheckerRuleId' DontUseCodeActionCreateRuleId' MixedVersionsOfMefAttributesRuleId' UseArrayEmptyRuleId' ImplementIEquatableRuleId' OverrideObjectEqualsRuleId' MissingSharedAttributeRuleId' DoNotUseVerbatimCrefsRuleId' CancellationTokenMustBeLastRuleId' DoNotCallToImmutableArrayRuleId' DoNotAccessDiagnosticDescriptorRuleId' DoNotCallLinqOnIndexable' ConsumePreserveSigRuleId' DeclarePublicApiRuleId' RemoveDeletedApiRuleId' DoNotCreateTasksWithoutTaskSchedulerRuleId' SymbolDeclaredEventRuleId' DeadCodeRuleId' DeadCodeTriggerRuleId
Broken Hierarchy,Roslyn.Diagnostics.Analyzers.Documentation,DoNotUseVerbatimCrefsAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\Roslyn\Core\Documentation\DoNotUseVerbatimCrefsAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Diagnostics.DiagnosticAnalyzer
