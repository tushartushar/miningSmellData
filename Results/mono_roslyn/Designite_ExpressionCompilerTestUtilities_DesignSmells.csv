Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.SymReaderInterop,SequencePointExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Test\PdbUtilities\Shared\SymUnmanagedSequencePoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,ExpressionCompilerTestHelpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\ExpressionCompilerTestHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.85
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,ExpressionCompilerTestHelpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\ExpressionCompilerTestHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,InspectionContextFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\InspectionContextFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Empty
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,InspectionContextFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\InspectionContextFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,NotImplementedSymUnmanagedReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\NotImplementedSymUnmanaged.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,RuntimeInstance,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\ModuleInstance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,MockSymUnmanagedHelpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\MockSymUnmanaged.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,SymReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\SymReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,TestExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\TestExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExpressionEvaluator,NotImplementedSymUnmanagedReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\ExpressionEvaluator\Core\Test\ExpressionCompiler\NotImplementedSymUnmanaged.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
