Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting.Test,ScriptingTestHelpers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\ScriptingTestHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.UnitTests,GlobalAssemblyCacheTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\GlobalAssemblyCacheTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Roslyn.Services.UnitTests,MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Errors which is more interested in members of the type: MetadataShadowCopyProvider
Feature Envy,Roslyn.Services.UnitTests,MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SuppressCopy1 which is more interested in members of the type: MetadataShadowCopyProvider
Feature Envy,Roslyn.Services.UnitTests,MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Modules which is more interested in members of the type: MetadataShadowCopyProvider
Feature Envy,Roslyn.Services.UnitTests,MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\MetadataShadowCopyProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetMetadata which is more interested in members of the type: MetadataShadowCopyProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting,ScriptEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Scripting\Test\ScriptEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting.ScriptEngine' Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting.Session
