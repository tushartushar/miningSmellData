Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Interactive,VsInteractiveWindowPackage<TVsInteractiveWindowProvider>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\VisualStudio\InteractiveServices\Interactive\VsInteractiveWindowPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateToolWindow
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Interactive,VsInteractiveWindowPackage<TVsInteractiveWindowProvider>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\VisualStudio\InteractiveServices\Interactive\VsInteractiveWindowPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Interactive,ResetInteractive,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\VisualStudio\InteractiveServices\Interactive\ResetInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Debugging,VsImmediateWindowProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\VisualStudio\InteractiveServices\Debugger\VsImmediateWindowProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Debugging.VsImmediateWindowProvider' Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Debugging.VsImmediateWindowPackage
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Debugging,DebuggerEvaluator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\VisualStudio\InteractiveServices\Debugger\DebuggerEvaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AbortCommand
