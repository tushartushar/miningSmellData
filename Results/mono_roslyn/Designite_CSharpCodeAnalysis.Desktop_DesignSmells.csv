Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,CSharpSerializableParseOptions,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Desktop\CSharpSerializableParseOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,CSharpFileSystemExtensions,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Desktop\CSharpFileSystemExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,CSharpSerializableCompilationOptions,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Desktop\CSharpSerializableCompilationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,CSharpCompiler,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Desktop\CommandLine\CSharpCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,CSharpCommandLineArguments,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Desktop\CommandLine\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CommandLineArguments
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp,CSharpCommandLineParser,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Compilers\CSharp\Desktop\CommandLine\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GenerateErrorForNoFilesFoundInRecurse
