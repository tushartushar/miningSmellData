Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text,Extensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.Shared.Extensions,ITextSnapshotExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Shared\Extensions\ITextSnapshotExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.Shared.Extensions,ITextSnapshotLineExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Shared\Extensions\ITextSnapshotLineExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.Shared.Extensions,TextSpanExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Shared\Extensions\TextSpanExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text,SnapshotSourceText,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Extensions.SnapshotSourceText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.SnapshotSourceText' Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.TextBufferContainer
Cyclic Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text,SnapshotSourceText,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Extensions.SnapshotSourceText.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ChangedSourceText
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text,ClosedSnapshotSourceText,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\EditorFeatures\Text\Extensions.SnapshotSourceText.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.SnapshotSourceText
