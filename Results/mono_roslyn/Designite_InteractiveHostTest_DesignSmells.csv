Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.UnitTests.Interactive,InteractiveHostTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\HostTest\InteractiveHostTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AsyncExecute_HangingForegroundThreads which is more interested in members of the type: InteractiveHost
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.UnitTests.Interactive,CompiledFile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\HostTest\InteractiveHostTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Path' Image
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.UnitTests.Interactive,CompiledFile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\HostTest\InteractiveHostTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Path' Image
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.UnitTests.Interactive,InteractiveHostTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\HostTest\InteractiveHostTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.UnitTests.Interactive,InteractiveHostTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\HostTest\InteractiveHostTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Broken Hierarchy,Roslyn.Interactive.CommandLine.UnitTests,CommandLineTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\HostTest\CommandLineTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Roslyn.Test.Utilities.TestBase
