Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.Analyzers,DiagnosticCategory,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\System.Runtime.Analyzers\Core\DiagnosticCategory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.Analyzers,DiagnosticExtensions,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\System.Runtime.Analyzers\Core\DiagnosticExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,System.Runtime.Analyzers,DiagnosticCategory,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\System.Runtime.Analyzers\Core\DiagnosticCategory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Design' Globalization' Interoperability' Performance' Reliability' Usage' Naming
Insufficient Modularization,System.Runtime.Analyzers,WellKnownTypes,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\System.Runtime.Analyzers\Core\WellKnownTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Runtime.Analyzers,WellKnownTypes,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\System.Runtime.Analyzers\Core\WellKnownTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
