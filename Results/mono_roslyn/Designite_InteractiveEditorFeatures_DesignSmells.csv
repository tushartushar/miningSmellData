Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Interactive,InteractiveEvaluator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\Extensibility\Interactive\InteractiveEvaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LanguageBufferContentTypeChanged which is more interested in members of the type: InteractiveWorkspace
Feature Envy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Interactive,InteractiveEvaluator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\Extensibility\Interactive\InteractiveEvaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetSubmissionDocument which is more interested in members of the type: InteractiveWorkspace
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Interactive,InteractiveEvaluator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\Extensibility\Interactive\InteractiveEvaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Interactive.InteractiveEvaluator' Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Implementation.Interactive.InteractiveWorkspace
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.CommandHandlers,InteractiveCompletionCommandHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\CommandHandlers\InteractiveCompletionCommandHandler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.CommandHandlers.AbstractCompletionCommandHandler
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.CommandHandlers,InteractiveIntelliSenseCommandHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\CommandHandlers\InteractiveIntelliSenseCommandHandler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.CommandHandlers.AbstractIntelliSenseCommandHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Implementation.Interactive,InteractiveDocumentNavigationService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\Implementation\Interactive\InteractiveDocumentNavigationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TryNavigateToLineAndOffset' TryNavigateToPosition
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.Implementation.Interactive,InteractiveGlobalUndoTransaction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Interactive\EditorFeatures\Core\Implementation\Interactive\InteractiveGlobalUndoServiceFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddDocument
