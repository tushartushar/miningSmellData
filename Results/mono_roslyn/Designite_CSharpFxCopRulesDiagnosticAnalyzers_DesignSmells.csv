Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design,CA1008CSharpCodeFixProvider,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\CSharp\Design\CodeFixes\CA1008CSharpCodeFixProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design,EnumWithFlagsCSharpCodeFixProvider,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\CSharp\Design\CodeFixes\EnumWithFlagsCSharpCodeFixProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design,Analyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\CSharp\Design\CSharpCA1003DiagnosticAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design.Analyzer' Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Globalization.Analyzer' Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Usage.Analyzer
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design,CSharpCA1024DiagnosticAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\CSharp\Design\CSharpCA1024DiagnosticAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design,CodeBlockEndedAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\CSharp\Design\CSharpCA1024DiagnosticAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Design.CodeBlockEndedAnalyzer' Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Performance.CodeBlockEndedAnalyzer
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.FxCopAnalyzers.Performance,CSharpCA1821DiagnosticAnalyzer,C:\repos\mono_roslyn\src\Diagnostics\FxCop\CSharp\Performance\CSharpCA1821DiagnosticAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
