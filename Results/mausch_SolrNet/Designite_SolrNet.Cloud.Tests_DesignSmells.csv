Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,CollectionsAdminTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\CollectionsAdminTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,SolrCloudStateProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\SolrCloudStateProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,UnityTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\UnityTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,StartupTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\StartupTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,SolrCloudOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\SolrCloudOperationsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,SolrClusterStateParserTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\SolrClusterStateParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,FakeEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\FakeEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,FakeEntity1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\FakeEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,CollectionsAdminTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\CollectionsAdminTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,CollectionsAdminTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\CollectionsAdminTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,FakeOperations<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\FakeOperations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 102 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,FakeOperations<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\FakeOperations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 103 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,FakeOperations<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\FakeOperations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SolrNet.Cloud.Tests,FakeOperations<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Cloud.Tests\FakeOperations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SolrNet.Cloud.Tests.FakeOperations<T>' SolrNet.Cloud.Tests.FakeProvider
