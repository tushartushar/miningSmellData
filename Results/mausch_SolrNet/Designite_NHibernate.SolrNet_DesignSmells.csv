Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet,CfgHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\CfgHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,IListenerSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\IListenerSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Commit' AddParameters
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,NHListenerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\NHHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Intf' ListenerType' ListenerCollection
Feature Envy,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,SolrNetListener<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\SolrNetListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateInternal which is more interested in members of the type: ISolrOperations
Deficient Encapsulation,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,NHListenerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\NHHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Intf' ListenerType' ListenerCollection
Insufficient Modularization,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,DelegatingSession,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\DelegatingSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 80 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,DelegatingSession,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\DelegatingSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 80 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,NHibernate.SolrNet.Impl,NHSolrQueryImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet\Impl\NHSolrQueryImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteUpdate' Enumerable' List' List
