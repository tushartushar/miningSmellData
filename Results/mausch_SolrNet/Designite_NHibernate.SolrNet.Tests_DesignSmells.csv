Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,CfgHelperTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\CfgHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,Entity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Description' Tags
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,IntegrationTests2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\IntegrationTests2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,Child,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\IntegrationTests2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' ChildProp1' Parent
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,DefaultValues,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\NHibernateMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Accessor' PoIDBaseName' PoIDGenerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,Parent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\IntegrationTests2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests.Parent' NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests.Child
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,EntityMapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\NHibernateMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests.EntityMapper' NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests.IdBinder
Broken Hierarchy,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,ListenersTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\ListenersTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests.BaseNHTests
Broken Hierarchy,NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests,SolrSessionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests\SolrSessionTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NHibernate.SolrNet.Tests.BaseNHTests
