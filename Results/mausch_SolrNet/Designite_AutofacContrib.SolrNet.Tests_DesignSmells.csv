Unutilized Abstraction,AutofacContrib.SolrNet.Tests,AutofacConfigFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\AutofacContrib.SolrNet.Tests\AutofacConfigFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutofacContrib.SolrNet.Tests,Entity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\AutofacContrib.SolrNet.Tests\AutofacFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
