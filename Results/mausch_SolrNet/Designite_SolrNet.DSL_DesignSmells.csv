Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.DSL.Impl,RangeDefinition<T>,C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Impl\RangeDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Rhino.Commons.LocalDataImpl,ILocalData,C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Utils\ILocalData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILocalData (C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Utils\ILocalData.cs' [1' 28])' Local (C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Utils\LocalData.cs' [1' 28])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rhino.Commons,Local,C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Utils\LocalData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data' RunningInWeb' current' LocalDataHashtableKey
Unutilized Abstraction,Rhino.Commons,Local,C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Utils\LocalData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.DSL,Solr,C:\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.DSL\Solr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
