Duplicate Abstraction,SolrNet.Utils,Container,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\CommonServiceLocator.SolrNet\Container.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Container (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\CommonServiceLocator.SolrNet\Container.cs' [1' 20])' Startup (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\CommonServiceLocator.SolrNet\Startup.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\CommonServiceLocator.SolrNet\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SolrNet,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\CommonServiceLocator.SolrNet\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitContainer which is more interested in members of the type: Container
