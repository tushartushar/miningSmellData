Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Tests.Integration,IntegrationFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\IntegrationFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SolrNet.Tests.Integration,IntegrationFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\IntegrationFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IntegrationFixture (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\IntegrationFixture.cs' [1' 30])' IntegrationFixtureAsync (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\IntegrationFixtureAsync.cs' [1' 30])

Unnecessary Abstraction,SolrNet.Unity.Tests,TestEntity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\Playground.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unutilized Abstraction,SolrNet.Tests,SolrCoreAdminFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\SolrCoreAdminFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SolrNet.Tests.Integration,IntegrationFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mausch_SolrNet\SolrNet.Tests.Integration\IntegrationFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
