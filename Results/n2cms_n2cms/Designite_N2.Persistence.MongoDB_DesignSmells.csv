Unexploited Encapsulation,N2.Persistence.MongoDB,MongoRepositoryExtensions,C:\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\MongoDB\MongoRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ParameterCollection' Parameter (in method "CreateQuery" of class "MongoRepositoryExtensions").
