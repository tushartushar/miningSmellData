Insufficient Modularization,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,IdentityUserStore<TUser>,C:\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\IdentityUserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,IdentityUserStore<TUser>,C:\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\IdentityUserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 76 methods
Insufficient Modularization,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,IdentityUserStore<TUser>,C:\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\IdentityUserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Broken Hierarchy,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,ContentUser,C:\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\ContentUser.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): N2.Security.Items.User
