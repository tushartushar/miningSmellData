Unutilized Abstraction,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,CompatibilityModePasswordHasher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\CompatibilityModePasswordHasher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,NamespaceDoc,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,IdentityUserStore<TUser>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\IdentityUserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,IdentityUserStore<TUser>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\IdentityUserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 76 methods
Insufficient Modularization,N2.Security.AspNet.Identity,IdentityUserStore<TUser>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\N2.Security.AspNet.Identity\IdentityStore\IdentityUserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 109
