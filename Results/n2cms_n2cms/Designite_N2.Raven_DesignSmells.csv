Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Insufficient Modularization,N2.Raven,RavenContentItemList<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenContentItemList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,N2.Raven,RavenConnectionProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenConnectionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: N2.Raven.RavenConnectionProvider' N2.Raven.RavenStoreFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,N2.Raven,RavenConnectionProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenConnectionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: N2.Raven.RavenConnectionProvider' N2.Raven.ContentReferenceResolver' N2.Raven.RavenStoreFactory
Rebellious Hierarchy,N2.Raven,RavenContentItemList<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenContentItemList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Find' Select' FindCount
Missing Hierarchy,N2.Raven,ContentReferenceResolver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\ContentReferenceResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IContentItemList' ContentItem (in method "GetReference" of class "ContentReferenceResolver").
Rebellious Hierarchy,N2.Raven,RavenSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AppendChildren' Move' Copy
Rebellious Hierarchy,N2.Raven,RavenInstallationManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenInstallationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CheckConnection' CheckDatabase' CheckRootItem' CheckStartPage' GetStatus' Upgrade' Install' ExecuteQuery' ExportSchema' ExportSchema' ExportUpgradeSchema
Rebellious Hierarchy,N2.Raven,RavenContentRepository,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FindDescendants' FindReferencing' RemoveReferencesToRecursive
Rebellious Hierarchy,N2.Raven,RavenRepository<TEntity>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven\RavenRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Find' Select' Exists' Count' Count' BeginTransaction' GetTransaction
