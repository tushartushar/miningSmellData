Broken Hierarchy,N2.Templates.Mvc.Models.Pages,PageBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Mvc\MvcTemplates\Models\Pages\PageBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): N2.ContentItem
Broken Hierarchy,N2.Templates.Mvc.Models.Pages,AbstractPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Mvc\MvcTemplates\Models\Pages\PageBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): N2.Templates.Mvc.Models.Pages.PageBase' N2.Web.UI.IItemContainer
Multipath Hierarchy,N2.Templates.Mvc.Models.Pages,GalleryItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Mvc\MvcTemplates\Models\Pages\GalleryItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IInjectable
Cyclic Hierarchy,N2.Templates.Mvc.Models.Pages,LanguageRoot,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Mvc\MvcTemplates\Models\Pages\LanguageRoot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: StartPage
Multipath Hierarchy,N2.Templates.Mvc.Models.Pages,RssFeed,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Mvc\MvcTemplates\Models\Pages\RssFeed.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly.
