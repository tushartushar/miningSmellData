Unnecessary Abstraction,N2.Raven.Tests,MyItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\MyItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Text
Unutilized Abstraction,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveOrUpdate_PropertiesArePersisted which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveOrUpdate_DetailsArePersisted which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveOrUpdate_Children_AreRetrieved which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveOrUpdate_Children_AreRetrieved_ByChildReference which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Find_ByParameter which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Find_ByParameter_And_Parameter which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Feature Envy,N2.Raven.Tests,RavenRepositoryTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\RavenRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Find_ByParameter_And_NotParameter which is more interested in members of the type: RavenContentRepository
Imperative Abstraction,N2.Raven.Tests,FakeStoreFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\SerializationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateStore
Broken Hierarchy,N2.Raven.Tests,MyItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\n2cms_n2cms\src\Framework\Raven.Tests\MyItem.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): N2.ContentItem
