Missing Hierarchy,Serenity.Data,RowFieldsBase,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.Data.Entity\Row\RowFieldsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DateTimeField' IEnumTypeField (in method "Initialize" of class "RowFieldsBase").
