Unutilized Abstraction,Serenity.CodeGenerator,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Serenity.CodeGenerator,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GenerateCodes_Click which is more interested in members of the type: GeneratorConfig
Feature Envy,Serenity.CodeGenerator,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: btnKDiff3PathBrowse_Click which is more interested in members of the type: GeneratorConfig
