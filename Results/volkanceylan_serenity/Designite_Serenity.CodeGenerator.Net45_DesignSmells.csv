This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,Serenity.CodeGenerator,EntityJoin,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator\Models\EntityJoin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' SourceField' Fields
Unnecessary Abstraction,Serenity.CodeGenerator,Table,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\Generator\GeneratorConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Tablename' Identifier' Module' ConnectionKey' PermissionKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,Serenity.CodeGenerator,BaseRowClass,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\Generator\GeneratorConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ClassName' Fields
Unutilized Abstraction,Serenity.CodeGenerator,MainWindow,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Serenity.CodeGenerator,CodeFileHelper,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\Helpers\CodeFileHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Kdiff3Path' TFSIntegration' TFPath' TSCPath
Deficient Encapsulation,Serenity.CodeGenerator,CodeFileHelper,C:\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.CodeGenerator.Net45\Helpers\CodeFileHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Kdiff3Path' TFSIntegration' TFPath' TSCPath
