Unnecessary Abstraction,Serenity.Testing,Cached<TDbScript>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.Testing\DbOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Script' ScriptHash
Unutilized Abstraction,Serenity.Testing,MunqContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.Testing\MunqContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Serenity.Testing,TestSqlHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.Testing\TestSqlHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Serenity.Testing,Cached<TDbScript>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.Testing\DbOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Script' ScriptHash
Deficient Encapsulation,Serenity.Testing,Cached<TDbScript>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\volkanceylan_serenity\Serenity.Testing\DbOverride.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Script' ScriptHash
