Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,Assert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Should.Core.Assertions.Assert' Should.Core.Assertions.Record
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,AssertEqualityComparer<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\AssertEqualityComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Should.Core.Assertions.AssertEqualityComparer<T>' Should.Core.Assertions.EnumerableEqualityComparer
Rebellious Hierarchy,Should.Core.Assertions,Assertions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assertions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Equals
Cyclic Hierarchy,Should.Core,DatePrecision,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SecondPrecision
Cyclic Hierarchy,Should.Core,DatePrecision,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MinutePrecision
Cyclic Hierarchy,Should.Core,DatePrecision,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: HourPrecision
Cyclic Hierarchy,Should.Core,DatePrecision,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DayPrecision
Cyclic Hierarchy,Should.Core,DatePrecision,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy).
