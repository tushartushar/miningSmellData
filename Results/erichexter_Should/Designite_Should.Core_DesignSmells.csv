Deficient Encapsulation,Should.Core,DatePrecision,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Second' Minute' Hour' Date' Month' Year
Deficient Encapsulation,Should.Core,DatePrecision,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\DatePrecision.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Second' Minute' Hour' Date' Month' Year
Deficient Encapsulation,Should.Core.Exceptions,AssertException,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Exceptions\AssertException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FilterStackTraceAssemblyPrefix
Deficient Encapsulation,Should.Core.Exceptions,AssertException,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Exceptions\AssertException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: FilterStackTraceAssemblyPrefix
Insufficient Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,Assert,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 64 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,Assert,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 67 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,Assert,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 117
Insufficient Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,Assertions,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assertions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Should.Core.Assertions,Assertions,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assertions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Should.Core.Assertions,Assertions,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Assertions\Assertions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Equals
Wide Hierarchy,Should.Core.Exceptions,AssertException,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Exceptions\AssertException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Should.Core.Exceptions.AssertActualExpectedException' Should.Core.Exceptions.ComparisonException' Should.Core.Exceptions.ContainsException' Should.Core.Exceptions.DoesNotContainException' Should.Core.Exceptions.EmptyException' Should.Core.Exceptions.FalseException' Should.Core.Exceptions.InRangeException' Should.Core.Exceptions.NotEmptyException' Should.Core.Exceptions.NotInRangeException' Should.Core.Exceptions.NotNullException' Should.Core.Exceptions.NotSameException' Should.Core.Exceptions.SingleException' Should.Core.Exceptions.StartsWithException' Should.Core.Exceptions.TimeoutException' Should.Core.Exceptions.TraceAssertException' Should.Core.Exceptions.TrueException
Unfactored Hierarchy,Should.Core.Exceptions,InRangeException,C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Exceptions\InRangeException.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  InRangeException (C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Exceptions\InRangeException.cs' [22' 65])' NotInRangeException (C:\repos\erichexter_Should\src\Should.Core\Exceptions\NotInRangeException.cs' [22' 65])
