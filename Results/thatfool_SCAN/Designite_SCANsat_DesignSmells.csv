Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,SCANui,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\SCANui.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: cb_orange' cb_skyBlue' cb_bluishGreen' cb_yellow' cb_blue' cb_vermillion' cb_reddishPurple' c_bad
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,SCANmap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\SCANmap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: legend' projectionNames' mapscale' lon_offset' lat_offset' mapwidth' mapheight' mapmode' projection' map
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,SCANmap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\SCANmap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: legend' projectionNames
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,RemoteView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\RemoteView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lookat' lookdetail
Insufficient Modularization,SCANsat,SCANcontroller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\SCANcontroller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,SCANsat,SCANsensor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\SCANcontroller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' sensor' fov' min_alt' max_alt' best_alt' inRange' bestRange
Broken Modularization,SCANsat,SCANvessel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thatfool_SCAN\SCANcontroller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
