Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,SCANmap,C:\repos\thatfool_SCAN\SCANmap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: legend' projectionNames' lat_offset' mapheight' mapmode' projection' map
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,SCANmap,C:\repos\thatfool_SCAN\SCANmap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: legend' projectionNames
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsat,RemoteView,C:\repos\thatfool_SCAN\RemoteView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lookat' lookdetail
Insufficient Modularization,SCANsat,SCANcontroller,C:\repos\thatfool_SCAN\SCANcontroller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SCANsat,SCANcontroller,C:\repos\thatfool_SCAN\SCANcontroller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SCANcontroller' SCANdata
