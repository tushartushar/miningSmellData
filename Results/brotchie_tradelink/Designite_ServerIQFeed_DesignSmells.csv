Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,IQFeedBroker,IQFeedFrm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerIQ-DTN\IQFeedFrm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: IQFeedFrm which is more interested in members of the type: IQFeedHelper
Deficient Encapsulation,IQFeedBroker,IQFeedHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerIQ-DTN\IQFeedHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DtnPath' tl' port
Insufficient Modularization,IQFeedBroker,IQFeedHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerIQ-DTN\IQFeedHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,IQFeedBroker,IQFeedHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerIQ-DTN\IQFeedHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Broken Modularization,IQFeedBroker.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerIQ-DTN\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' UserID' Password' PROGRAM_NAME' ADMINISTRATION_SOCKET_NAME' LEVEL_ONE_SOCKET_NAME' IP_LOCAL_HOST' TLClientAddress' TLClientPort' ReleaseDeadSymbols' DtnPath' Port' PaperTrade' PaperTradeUsesBidAsk' IgnoreAfterTimeWithBefore' IfBeforeTimeUseIgnoreAfter' ReportLatency' SaveRawFeed' IgnoreOutofOrderTicks' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IQFeedBroker,IQFeedFrm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerIQ-DTN\IQFeedFrm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IQFeedBroker.IQFeedFrm' IQFeedBroker.IQFeedHelper
