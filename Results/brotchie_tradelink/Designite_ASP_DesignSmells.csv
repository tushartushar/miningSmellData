Feature Envy,ASP,ASP,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\asp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: _opttog_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ASPOptions
Imperative Abstraction,ASP,ASPOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\ASPOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ASPOptions_FormClosing
Deficient Encapsulation,ASP,ASP,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\asp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _saveskins' _remskin' _skins
Deficient Encapsulation,ASP,ASPOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\ASPOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: archivetickbox' _account' _providerfallback' _datasel' _execsel' _dest' _portal' _saveinds' _usemkttime
Insufficient Modularization,ASP,ASP,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\asp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 84 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ASP,ASP,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\asp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 227
Broken Modularization,ASP.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ASP\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' boxdll' accountname' usevirtualids' brokertimeoutsec' prefquote' prefexecute' feedfallback' defaultdest' TickBufferSize' TicketTracking' TicketsOnClose' TicketsOnCloseMaxAttempts' ServerPort' ServerIpAddresses' VerboseDebugging' portal' un' pw' saveindicators' UseMarketTimeStamps' OversellProtection' OversellSplit' HandleResponseExceptions' DisableResponseOnException' defaultInstance
