Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Kadina,kadinamain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\Kadina\KadinaMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: bindresponseevents which is more interested in members of the type: Response
Feature Envy,Kadina,kadinamain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\Kadina\KadinaMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: unbindresponseevents which is more interested in members of the type: Response
Insufficient Modularization,Kadina,kadinamain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\Kadina\KadinaMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 79 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Kadina,kadinamain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\Kadina\KadinaMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 167
Broken Modularization,Kadina.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\Kadina\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' recentfiles' boxdebugs' recentresponselibs' ChartLast' ChartNoLastUseBid' UseBidAskFills' DecimalPlaces' portal' user' pw' ShowTicksOnTickTab' defaultInstance
