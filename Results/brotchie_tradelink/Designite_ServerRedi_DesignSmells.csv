Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ServerRedi,RediMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\RediMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RediMain which is more interested in members of the type: ServerRedi
Duplicate Abstraction,ServerRedi,ServerRedi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ServerRedi (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs' [362' 383])' ServerRedi (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs' [489' 510])
Duplicate Abstraction,ServerRedi,ServerRedi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ServerRedi (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs' [584' 618])' ServerRedi (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs' [636' 670])
Feature Envy,ServerRedi,ServerRedi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ServerRedi which is more interested in members of the type: TLServer
Deficient Encapsulation,ServerRedi,ServerRedi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tl
Insufficient Modularization,ServerRedi,ServerRedi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\ServerRedi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 149
Broken Modularization,ServerRedi.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brotchie_tradelink\ServerRedi\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' un' pw' acronym' TLClientPort' TLClientAddress' AccountsAvailable' accnt' VerboseDebugging' PaperTrade' PaperTradeBidAsk' TickDebuggingVerbose' defaultInstance
