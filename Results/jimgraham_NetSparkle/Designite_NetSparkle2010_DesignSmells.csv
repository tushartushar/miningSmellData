Imperative Abstraction,AppLimit.NetSparkle,NetSparkleAppCast,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkleAppCast.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetLatestVersion
Feature Envy,AppLimit.NetSparkle,NetSparkleDeviceInventory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkleDeviceInventory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BuildRequestUrl which is more interested in members of the type: NetSparkleConfiguration
Feature Envy,AppLimit.NetSparkle,NetSparkleDiagnostic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkleDiagnostic.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ShowDiagnosticWindowIfNeeded which is more interested in members of the type: NetSparkleMainWindows
