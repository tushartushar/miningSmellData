Imperative Abstraction,AppLimit.NetSparkle,NetSparkleAppCast,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkleAppCast.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetLatestVersion
Feature Envy,AppLimit.NetSparkle,NetSparkleDeviceInventory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkleDeviceInventory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BuildRequestUrl which is more interested in members of the type: NetSparkleConfiguration
Unutilized Abstraction,AppLimit.NetSparkle,NetSparkleMainWindows,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkleMainWindows.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,AppLimit.NetSparkle,Sparkle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AppLimit.NetSparkle,Sparkle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jimgraham_NetSparkle\NetSparkle\NetSparkle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AppLimit.NetSparkle.Sparkle' AppLimit.NetSparkle.NetSparkleDownloadProgress
