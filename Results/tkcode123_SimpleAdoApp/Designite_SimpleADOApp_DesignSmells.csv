Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ADOExtensions,Extensions,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\ADOExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,SimpleADOApp,StructuredDataDescription,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredDataDescription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Insufficient Modularization,ADOExtensions,ReliableReader,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\ReliableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ADOExtensions,ReliableReader,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\ReliableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SimpleADOApp,StructuredData,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleADOApp,StructuredData,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StructuredData' StructuredDataDescription
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleADOApp,StructuredData,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StructuredData' StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor' StructuredDataDescription
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleADOApp,StructuredData,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StructuredData' StructuredDataDescription' StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor' StructuredDataDescription
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleADOApp,StructuredData,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StructuredData' StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor' StructuredDataDescription' StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor' StructuredDataDescription
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleADOApp,StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StructuredDataPropertyDescriptor' StructuredDataDescription
Rebellious Hierarchy,ADOExtensions,ReliableReader,C:\repos\tkcode123_SimpleAdoApp\src\SimpleADOApp\ReliableReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetValues' GetDbDataReader
