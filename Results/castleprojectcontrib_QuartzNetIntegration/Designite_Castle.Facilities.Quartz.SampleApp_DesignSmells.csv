Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp.Jobs,ISampleJob,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Jobs\SampleJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp.Listeners,ISampleJobListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Listeners\SampleJobListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp.Listeners,ISampleSchedulerListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Listeners\SampleSchedulerListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp.Listeners,ISampleTriggerListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Listeners\SampleTriggerListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Program.cs' [34' 67])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Program.cs' [88' 121])
Insufficient Modularization,Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp.Listeners,SampleSchedulerListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleprojectcontrib_QuartzNetIntegration\src\Castle.Facilities.Quartz.SampleApp\Listeners\SampleSchedulerListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
