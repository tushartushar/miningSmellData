Multipath Hierarchy,MYIoc.Config,constructor,C:\repos\hanwest00_MYTestWeb\MYIoc\Config\constructor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: INode
Broken Hierarchy,MYIoc.Config,constructor,C:\repos\hanwest00_MYTestWeb\MYIoc\Config\constructor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): method' INode
