Insufficient Modularization,Sample.Topshelf.Quartz.BackgroundJobs,SimpleScheduleListener,C:\repos\dtinteractive_Topshelf.Integrations\Samples\Sample.Topshelf.Quartz.BackgroundJobs\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Sample.Topshelf.Quartz.BackgroundJobs,SampleModule,C:\repos\dtinteractive_Topshelf.Integrations\Samples\Sample.Topshelf.Quartz.BackgroundJobs\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Load
