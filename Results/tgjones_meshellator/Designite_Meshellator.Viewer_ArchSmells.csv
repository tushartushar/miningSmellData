Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Meshellator.Viewer,Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering' Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering.Decorators
Unstable Dependency,Meshellator.Viewer,Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering.Decorators' Meshellator.Importers.Autodesk3ds
Unstable Dependency,Meshellator.Viewer,Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Scenes,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Meshellator
Unstable Dependency,Meshellator.Viewer,Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Services,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering
Feature Concentration,Meshellator.Viewer,Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConversionExtensions]' [FillMode' RenderParameters' RenderSettings' Model' ModelConverter' ModelMesh' Renderer' VertexPositionNormalTexture]' [GraphicsDeviceService' IGraphicsDeviceService]' [RenderWindow]' [VertexTransformedPositionTexture]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38
Feature Concentration,Meshellator.Viewer,Meshellator.Viewer.Framework.Rendering.Effects,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [EffectParameter' EffectWrapperBase' GaussianBlurEffect' LineEffect' SimpleEffect]' [EffectUtility]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
