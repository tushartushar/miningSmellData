Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,GenericDelegates<T;TResult;T1;T2;T3>,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Empty
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,DependencyResolverExtensions,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.ServiceBus\DependencyResolverExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,CulturePair,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Culture' UICulture
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Empty
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 49 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,C:\repos\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 71 methods
