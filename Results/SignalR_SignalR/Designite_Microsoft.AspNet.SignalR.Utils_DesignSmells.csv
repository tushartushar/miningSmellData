Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils,GenerateHubProxyCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils\Commands\GenerateHubProxyCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,PerformanceCounterAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\Infrastructure\PerformanceCounterAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description' CounterType
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reflection,AssemblyMetadataAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Common\AssemblyMetadataAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils,GenerateHubProxyCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils\Commands\GenerateHubProxyCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils.GenerateHubProxyCommand' Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils.Program
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils,Command,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Utils\Commands\Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Infrastructure,NoOpPerformanceCounter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\Infrastructure\NoOpPerformanceCounter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Close' RemoveInstance
