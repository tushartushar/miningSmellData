Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,MyRejoinGroupConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Stress\StressRuns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,EventMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Stress\StressRuns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StreamIndex' Id' Message
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,CulturePair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Culture' UICulture
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,CulturePair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Culture' UICulture
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Empty
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskCache<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Empty
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,StressArguments,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Help' Url' RunName' SampleRate' SendDelay' Connections' PayloadSize' Senders' Transport' Host' Duration' Warmup' RedisPassword' RedisServer' RedisPort' ServiceBusConnectionString' SqlConnectionString' SqlTableCount
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,RunData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\RunData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SampleRate' Duration' Warmup' Transport' Host' Payload' Url' Senders' Connections' SendDelay' RedisServer' RedisPassword' RedisPort' SqlConnectionString' SqlTableCount' ServiceBusConnectionString' StreamCount
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 49 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 71 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR,TaskAsyncHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core\TaskAsyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 122
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,SendReceiveRun,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Performance\SendReceiveRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: InitializePerformanceCounters
Unfactored Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress,RunBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\RunBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  RunBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\RunBase.cs' [296' 321])' StressRunBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SignalR_SignalR\src\Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Stress\Stress\StressRunBase.cs' [114' 139])
