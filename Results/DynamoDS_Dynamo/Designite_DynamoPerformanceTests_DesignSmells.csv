Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,DynamoPerformanceTests,DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase.cs' [16' 65])' DynamoViewPerformanceTestBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoViewPerformanceTestBase.cs' [12' 61])
Imperative Abstraction,DynamoPerformanceTests,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\PerformanceTestConsoleApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Imperative Abstraction,DynamoPerformanceTests,ResultsComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\ResultsComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DefaultBenchmarkComparison
Feature Envy,DynamoPerformanceTests,BenchmarkComparison,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\ResultsComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetComparisonData which is more interested in members of the type: BenchmarkResult
Deficient Encapsulation,DynamoPerformanceTests,DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: testDirectory
Deficient Encapsulation,DynamoPerformanceTests,DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoModelPerformanceTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: testDirectory
Deficient Encapsulation,DynamoPerformanceTests,DynamoViewPerformanceTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoViewPerformanceTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: testDirectory
Deficient Encapsulation,DynamoPerformanceTests,DynamoViewPerformanceTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\DynamoViewPerformanceTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: testDirectory
Rebellious Hierarchy,DynamoPerformanceTests,GraphNameColumn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\Performance\DynamoPerformanceTests\GraphNameColumn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
