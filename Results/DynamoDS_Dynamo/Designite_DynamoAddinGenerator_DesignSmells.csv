Unutilized Abstraction,DynamoAddinGenerator,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DynamoAddinGenerator,DynamoVersions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dynamo_063' dynamo_071_x86' dynamo_071_x64' dynamo_07x
Unnecessary Abstraction,DynamoAddinGenerator,IRevitProductCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Products
Unnecessary Abstraction,DynamoAddinGenerator,IRevitProduct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ProductName' AddinsFolder' InstallLocation' VersionString
Unnecessary Abstraction,DynamoAddinGenerator,IDynamoInstall,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Folder
Unnecessary Abstraction,DynamoAddinGenerator,IDynamoAddinData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AssemblyPath' AddinPath' RevitSubfolder' Id' ClassName
Deficient Encapsulation,DynamoAddinGenerator,DynamoVersions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dynamo_063' dynamo_071_x86' dynamo_071_x64' dynamo_07x
Deficient Encapsulation,DynamoAddinGenerator,DynamoVersions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: dynamo_063' dynamo_071_x86' dynamo_071_x64' dynamo_07x
Broken Modularization,DynamoAddinGenerator,IDynamoAddinData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\tools\DynamoAddinGenerator\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AssemblyPath' AddinPath' RevitSubfolder' Id' ClassName
