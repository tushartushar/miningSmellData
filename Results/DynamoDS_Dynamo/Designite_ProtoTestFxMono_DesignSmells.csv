Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoTestFx,InterfaceFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\DebugService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ProtoTestFx,DebugTestFx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\DebugTestFx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DebugTestFx (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\DebugTestFx.cs' [81' 105])' DebugTestFx (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\DebugTestFx.cs' [153' 177])
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoTestFx,InjectionExecutiveProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\WatchTestFx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ProtoTestFx,InjectionExecutiveProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\WatchTestFx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  InjectionExecutiveProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\WatchTestFx.cs' [254' 276])' InjectionExecutiveProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\WatchTestFx.cs' [294' 316])
Imperative Abstraction,ProtoTestFx,InjectionExecutive,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\WatchTestFx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Print
Unutilized Abstraction,ProtoTestFx.TD,TestFrameWork,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\TestFrameWork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ProtoTestFx,Expression,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\WatchTestFx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LineNo' Expr' ClassIndex
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoTestFx.TD,TestFrameWork,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\TestFrameWork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoTestFx.TD,TestFrameWork,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\TestFrameWork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ProtoTestFx.TD,TestFrameWork,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamoDS_Dynamo\test\Engine\ProtoTestFx\TestFrameWork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 121
