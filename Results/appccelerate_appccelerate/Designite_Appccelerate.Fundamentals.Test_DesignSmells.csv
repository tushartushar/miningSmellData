Unutilized Abstraction,Appccelerate,EnsureTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\EnsureTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Appccelerate,IInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\EnsureTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Unutilized Abstraction,Appccelerate.Formatters,FormatHelperTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\Formatters\FormatHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Appccelerate.Formatters,FormatHelperTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\Formatters\FormatHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FormatHelperTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\Formatters\FormatHelperTest.cs' [3' 22])' TypeExtensionsTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\Formatters\TypeExtensionsTest.cs' [3' 22])
Unutilized Abstraction,Appccelerate.Formatters,StringTruncationFormatterTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\Formatters\StringTruncationFormatterTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Appccelerate.Formatters,TypeExtensionsTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\Formatters\TypeExtensionsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,Appccelerate,EnsureTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\EnsureTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 64 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Appccelerate,EnsureTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appccelerate_appccelerate\source\Appccelerate.Fundamentals.Test\EnsureTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 64 methods
