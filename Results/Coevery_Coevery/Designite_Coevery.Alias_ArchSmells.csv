Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder' Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Map,Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder.AliasHolder' Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Map.AliasMap
Unstable Dependency,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Map,Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder.AliasMap
Feature Concentration,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.Implementation,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AliasRoute' DefaultAliasService' Utils' LookupHttpContext]' [StubHttpContext]' [StubHttpRequest]' [LookupHttpRequest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.57,Coevery.Alias.Implementation.StubHttpContext' Coevery.Alias.Implementation.StubHttpRequest' Coevery.Alias.Implementation.LookupHttpRequest
Feature Concentration,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.ViewModels,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AdminIndexViewModel]' [AliasEntry]' [AdminIndexOptions]' [AliasOrder]' [AliasFilter]' [AliasBulkAction]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,Coevery.Alias.ViewModels.AliasEntry' Coevery.Alias.ViewModels.AdminIndexOptions' Coevery.Alias.ViewModels.AliasOrder' Coevery.Alias.ViewModels.AliasFilter' Coevery.Alias.ViewModels.AliasBulkAction
Scattered Functionality,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.Controllers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Coevery.Security' Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Security.IAuthorizer' Coevery.Alias.IAliasService
Scattered Functionality,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.Controllers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Coevery.Security' Coevery.Alias' Coevery.Data' Coevery.UI.Notify' Coevery.Logging,Coevery.Security.IAuthorizer' Coevery.Alias.IAliasService' Coevery.Data.ITransactionManager' Coevery.UI.Notify.NotifierExtensions' Coevery.Logging.LoggingExtensions
Scattered Functionality,Coevery.Alias,Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Storage,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Coevery.Data' Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder,Coevery.Data.IRepository' Coevery.Alias.Implementation.Holder.IAliasHolder
