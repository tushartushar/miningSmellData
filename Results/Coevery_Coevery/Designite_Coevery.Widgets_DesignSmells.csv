Feature Envy,Coevery.Widgets.Controllers,AdminController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Controllers\AdminController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Index which is more interested in members of the type: IWidgetsService
Unutilized Abstraction,Coevery.Widgets.Drivers,LayerPartDriver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Drivers\LayerPartDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description' LayerRule
Unnecessary Abstraction,Coevery.Widgets.Models,LayerPartRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Models\LayerPartRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description' LayerRule
Unnecessary Abstraction,Coevery.Widgets.Models,WidgetPartRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Models\WidgetPartRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Title' Position' Zone' RenderTitle' Name
Feature Envy,Coevery.Widgets.Services,LayerResolverSelector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Services\LayerResolverSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ResolveIdentity which is more interested in members of the type: IContentManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,Coevery.Widgets.Services,RuleContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Services\RuleContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FunctionName' Arguments' Result
Broken Modularization,Coevery.Widgets.Models,WidgetPart,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Models\WidgetPart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Title' Zone' RenderTitle' Position' Name' LayerPart' LayerId' AvailableZones' AvailableLayers
Broken Modularization,Coevery.Widgets.Models,WidgetPartRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Models\WidgetPartRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Title' Position' Zone' RenderTitle' Name
Insufficient Modularization,Coevery.Widgets.Services,WidgetsService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Services\WidgetsService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Coevery.Widgets.Commands,LayerCommands,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Commands\LayerCommands.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Coevery.Commands.DefaultCoeveryCommandHandler
Broken Hierarchy,Coevery.Widgets.Commands,WidgetCommands,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Commands\WidgetCommands.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Coevery.Commands.DefaultCoeveryCommandHandler
Broken Hierarchy,Coevery.Widgets.Models,LayerPart,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Models\LayerPart.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Coevery.ContentManagement.ContentPart
Broken Hierarchy,Coevery.Widgets.Models,WidgetPart,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Coevery_Coevery\src\Coevery.Web\Modules\Coevery.Widgets\Models\WidgetPart.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Coevery.ContentManagement.ContentPart' Coevery.ContentManagement.Aspects.ITitleAspect
