Unutilized Abstraction,Proximity.Extensions,ProximityExtensions,C:\repos\Mushroog_KSP_Proximity\Proximity - Release 2.0\Proximity\Extensions\ProximityExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Proximity.Extensions,RectExtensions,C:\repos\Mushroog_KSP_Proximity\Proximity - Release 2.0\Proximity\Extensions\RectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Proximity,Proximity,C:\repos\Mushroog_KSP_Proximity\Proximity - Release 2.0\Proximity\Proximity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unutilized Abstraction,Proximity,Proximity,C:\repos\Mushroog_KSP_Proximity\Proximity - Release 2.0\Proximity\Proximity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Proximity,Proximity,C:\repos\Mushroog_KSP_Proximity\Proximity - Release 2.0\Proximity\Proximity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: position' sampleRate' frequency
Insufficient Modularization,Proximity,Proximity,C:\repos\Mushroog_KSP_Proximity\Proximity - Release 2.0\Proximity\Proximity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 150
