Duplicate Abstraction,ContainerRegistry.Tests,ManifestTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\containerregistry\Microsoft.Azure.ContainerRegistry\tests\Tests\ManifestTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ManifestTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\containerregistry\Microsoft.Azure.ContainerRegistry\tests\Tests\ManifestTests.cs' [267' 299])' ManifestTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\containerregistry\Microsoft.Azure.ContainerRegistry\tests\Tests\ManifestTests.cs' [305' 337])
Feature Envy,ContainerRegistry.Tests,ManifestTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\containerregistry\Microsoft.Azure.ContainerRegistry\tests\Tests\ManifestTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetAcrManifestAttributes which is more interested in members of the type: ManifestAttributes
