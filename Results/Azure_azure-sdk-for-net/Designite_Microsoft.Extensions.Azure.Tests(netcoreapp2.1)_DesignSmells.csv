Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Extensions.Azure.Tests,MockLoggerFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\core\Microsoft.Extensions.Azure\tests\LogForwarderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Loggers
Insufficient Modularization,Azure.Core.Extensions.Tests,AzureClientFactoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-sdk-for-net\sdk\core\Microsoft.Extensions.Azure\tests\AzureClientFactoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods).
