Cyclic Dependency,ScadaCommShell,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Scada.Comm.Shell.Code' Scada.Comm.Shell.Forms,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommShell' Scada.Comm.Shell.Forms.FrmCommonParams,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommShell' Scada.Comm.Shell.Forms.FrmCommonParams
Unstable Dependency,ScadaCommShell,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Scada.Comm.Shell.Forms,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmCommonParams' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmDeviceData' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmDrivers' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmLineParams' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmLineStats' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmStats,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmCommonParams' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmDeviceData' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmDrivers' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmLineParams' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmLineStats' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.FrmStats
Feature Concentration,ScadaCommShell,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CommLineCommand' CommEnvironment' CommShellUtils' CommNodeType' CommShell' CommShellPhrases]' [CommMessage]' [SettingsConverter]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommMessage' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.SettingsConverter,Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommLineCommand' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommMessage' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommNodeType' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommShell' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommEnvironment' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommShellPhrases' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.CommShellUtils' Scada.Comm.Shell.Code.SettingsConverter
