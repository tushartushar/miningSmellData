Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Svc,SvcInstaller,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\SvcInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Svc,SvcMain,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\SvcMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Scada.Comm.Svc,KPFullAddr,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\CommLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Address' CallNum
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Comm.Svc,CommandReader,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\CommandReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Comm.Svc.CommandReader' Scada.Comm.Svc.Manager
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Svc,CommLine,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\CommLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Svc,CommLine,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\CommLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 107
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Comm.Svc,Manager,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaCommSvc\Manager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Comm.Svc.Manager' Scada.Comm.Svc.CommandReader
