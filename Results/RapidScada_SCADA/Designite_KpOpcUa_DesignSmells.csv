Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,KpOpcUaLogic,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\KpOpcUaLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,ItemTag,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\KpOpcUaLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ItemConfig' KPTag
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,KpOpcUaView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\KpOpcUaView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowProps
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,KpOpcUaView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\KpOpcUaView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa,OpcUaHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\OpcUaHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConnectAsync
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,CtrlCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\CtrlCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetFocus
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,CtrlCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\CtrlCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,CtrlItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\CtrlItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,CtrlItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\CtrlItem.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateTag which is more interested in members of the type: ItemConfig
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,CtrlSubscription,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\CtrlSubscription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetFocus
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,CtrlSubscription,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\CtrlSubscription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,FrmConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,FrmConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 118
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,FrmConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SubscriptionConfig' ItemConfig (in method "btnMoveUpItem_Click" of class "FrmConfig").
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,FrmConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SubscriptionConfig' ItemConfig (in method "btnMoveDownItem_Click" of class "FrmConfig").
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.Comm.Devices.OpcUa.UI,FrmConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpOpcUa\OpcUa\UI\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SubscriptionConfig' ItemConfig (in method "btnDeleteItem_Click" of class "FrmConfig").
