Unnecessary Abstraction,ScadaAdmin.AgentSvcRef,AgentSvcChannel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\Connected Services\AgentSvcRef\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ScadaAdmin.Remote,CtrlServerConn,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\Remote\CtrlServerConn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ScadaAdmin.Remote,NodeInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\Remote\FrmUploadConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path' IsDirectory
Unnecessary Abstraction,ScadaAdmin.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,ScadaAdmin.AgentSvcRef,ConfigUploadMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\Connected Services\AgentSvcRef\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConfigOptions' SessionID' Stream
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,Tables,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\AppCode\Tables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,Tables,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\AppCode\Tables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 56 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,Tables,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\AppCode\Tables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 127
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,FrmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,FrmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 145
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,FrmTable,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\FrmTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ScadaAdmin,FrmTable,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\FrmTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 109
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScadaAdmin,AppData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\AppCode\AppData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScadaAdmin.AppData' ScadaAdmin.Settings
Missing Hierarchy,ScadaAdmin,FrmImport,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaAdmin\ScadaAdmin\FrmImport.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ImportAllTablesItem' ImportArchiveItem (in method "cbTable_SelectedIndexChanged" of class "FrmImport").
