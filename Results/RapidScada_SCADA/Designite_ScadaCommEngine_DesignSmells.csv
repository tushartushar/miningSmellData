Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,Scada.Comm.Engine,KPFullAddr,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaComm\ScadaCommEngine\CommLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Address' CallNum
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Engine,CommLine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaComm\ScadaCommEngine\CommLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Engine,CommLine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaComm\ScadaCommEngine\CommLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Comm.Engine,CommandReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\ScadaComm\ScadaCommEngine\CommandReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Comm.Engine.CommandReader' Scada.Comm.Engine.Manager
