Broken Modularization,Scada.Comm.Devices.Modbus.Protocol,FuncCodes,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpModbus\Modbus\Protocol\FuncCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ReadDiscreteInputs' ReadCoils' ReadInputRegisters' ReadHoldingRegisters' WriteSingleCoil' WriteSingleRegister' WriteMultipleCoils' WriteMultipleRegisters
Broken Modularization,Scada.Comm.Devices.Modbus.UI,ElemInfo,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpModbus\Modbus\UI\ElemInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Elem' ElemGroup' Settings' Address' Signal' AddressRange' Caption
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Comm.Devices.Modbus.UI,FrmDevTemplate,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpModbus\Modbus\UI\FrmDevTemplate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
