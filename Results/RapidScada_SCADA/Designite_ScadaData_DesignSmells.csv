Broken Modularization,Scada.Data.Configuration,CnlTypes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Configuration\BaseValues.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TS' TI' TIDR' TIDRM' TIDRH' SWCNT' TSDR' TSDRM' TSDRH' MinCnlTypeID' MaxCnlTypeID
Broken Modularization,Scada.Data.Configuration,CnlStatuses,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Configuration\BaseValues.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Undefined' Defined' Archival' FormulaError' Changed' Unreliable' LowCrash' Low' Normal' High' HighCrash' InPermitted' OutPermitted' AccessDenied' WireBreak' Disarm' Arm' Alarm
Broken Modularization,Scada.Data.Configuration,Formats,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Configuration\BaseValues.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MinFixedID' MaxFixedID' EnumText' AsciiText' UnicodeText' DateTime' Date' Time
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.UI,TreeViewUtils,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\UI\TreeViewUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.UI,TreeViewUtils,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\UI\TreeViewUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Data.Tables,IBaseTable,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Tables\IBaseTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Data.Tables.IBaseTable' Scada.Data.Tables.TableRelation
Rebellious Hierarchy,Scada.Client,BaseView,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Client\BaseView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LoadFromStream
Unfactored Hierarchy,Scada.Data.Tables,EventAdapter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Tables\EventAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  EventAdapter (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Tables\EventAdapter.cs' [332' 353])' SrezAdapter (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\Data\Tables\SrezAdapter.cs' [328' 349])
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.UI,TreeViewUtils,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaData\ScadaData\UI\TreeViewUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ITreeNode' ITreeNode (in method "MoveUpSelectedNode" of class "TreeViewUtils").
