Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.KpSnmp,VarGroup,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Scada.Comm.Devices.KpSnmp.VarGroup' Scada.Comm.Devices.VarGroup
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.KpSnmp,FrmSettings,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\FrmSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Show
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices.KpSnmp,FrmConfig,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowDialog
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,KpSnmpLogic,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\KpSnmpLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,KpSnmpView,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\KpSnmpView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowProps
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Comm.Devices,KpSnmpView,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\KpSnmpView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.Comm.Devices.KpSnmp,FrmConfig,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaComm\OpenKPs\KpSnmp\FrmConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: VarGroup' Variable (in method "btnEdit_Click" of class "FrmConfig").
