Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Scada.Server.Engine,Comm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Comm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetFullFileName which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
Feature Envy,Scada.Server.Engine,MainLogic,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitCalculator which is more interested in members of the type: Calculator
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scada.Server.Engine,InCnl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CalcCnlData
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scada.Server.Engine,AvgData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Sum' Cnt
Unutilized Abstraction,Scada.Server.Engine,Manager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Manager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Scada.Server.Engine,InCnl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CalcCnlData
Deficient Encapsulation,Scada.Server.Engine,CtrlCnl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CalcCmdVal' CalcCmdData
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,Comm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Comm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 119
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,MainLogic,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 53 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,MainLogic,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\MainLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 228
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,Calculator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Calculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Server.Engine.Calculator' Scada.Server.Engine.MainLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,Comm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Comm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Server.Engine.Comm' Scada.Server.Engine.MainLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,Calculator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Calculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Server.Engine.Calculator' Scada.Server.Engine.InCnl' Scada.Server.Engine.MainLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Server.Engine,Calculator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaServer\ScadaServer\ScadaServerEngine\Calculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
