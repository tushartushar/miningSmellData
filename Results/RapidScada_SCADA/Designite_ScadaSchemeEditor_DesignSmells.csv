Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,AttrTranslator,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\AttrTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: TranslateAttrs
Duplicate Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,AttrTranslator,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\AttrTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AttrTranslator (C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\AttrTranslator.cs' [1' 25])' FrmMain (C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs' [1' 25])
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Change,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Change.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConvertToDTO
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Settings,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Settings,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Scada.Scheme.Editor.Settings' Scada.Scheme.Editor.Properties.Settings
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmAbout,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmAbout.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowAbout
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Change,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Change.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SchemeDocument' BaseComponent (in method "Change" of class "Change").
Deficient Encapsulation,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FormState,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\FormState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: screenWidth' formAdj
Unexploited Encapsulation,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmMain,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SchemeDocument' BaseComponent (in method "propertyGrid_PropertyValueChanged" of class "FrmMain").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,AppData,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\AppData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Scheme.Editor.AppData' Scada.Scheme.Editor.SchemeEditorSvc
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Editor,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Editor,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmMain,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,SchemeEditorSvc,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\SchemeEditorSvc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Scheme.Editor.SchemeEditorSvc' Scada.Scheme.Editor.AppData
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.Scheme.Editor,AttrTranslator,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\AttrTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: DisplayNameAttribute' CategoryAttribute (in method "TranslateAttrs" of class "AttrTranslator").
Missing Hierarchy,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Change,C:\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Change.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SchemeDocument' Image (in method "Change" of class "Change").
