Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Change,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Change.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConvertToDTO
Duplicate Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Scada.Scheme.Editor.Settings' Scada.Scheme.Editor.Properties.Settings
Imperative Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmAbout,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmAbout.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowAbout
Feature Envy,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: miEditCut_Click which is more interested in members of the type: Editor
Feature Envy,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: miEditPasteSpecial_Click which is more interested in members of the type: Editor
Unnecessary Abstraction,Scada.Scheme.Editor.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FormState,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\FormState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: screenWidth' formAdj
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Editor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,Editor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\Editor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,FrmMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Scada.Scheme.Editor,AppData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RapidScada_SCADA\ScadaWeb\ScadaScheme\ScadaSchemeEditor\AppCode\AppData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Scada.Scheme.Editor.AppData' Scada.Scheme.Editor.SchemeEditorSvc
