Unutilized Abstraction,DbUp.Support.SQLite,SQLiteObjectParser,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\SQLite\SQLiteObjectParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DbUp.Engine.Transactions,DatabaseConnectionManager,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Engine\Transactions\DatabaseConnectionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DbUp.Engine.Transactions.DatabaseConnectionManager' DbUp.Engine.Transactions.IConnectionFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DbUp.Engine.Transactions,IConnectionFactory,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Engine\Transactions\IConnectionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DbUp.Engine.Transactions.IConnectionFactory' DbUp.Engine.Transactions.DatabaseConnectionManager
Rebellious Hierarchy,DbUp.Engine.Transactions,DatabaseConnectionManager,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Engine\Transactions\DatabaseConnectionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SplitScriptIntoCommands
Rebellious Hierarchy,DbUp.Helpers,NullJournal,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Helpers\NullJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StoreExecutedScript
Broken Hierarchy,DbUp.ScriptProviders,EmbeddedScriptProvider,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\ScriptProviders\EmbeddedScriptProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DbUp.ScriptProviders.EmbeddedScriptsProvider
Unfactored Hierarchy,DbUp.Support.MySql,MySqlITableJournal,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\MySql\MySqlITableJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  MySqlITableJournal (C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\MySql\MySqlITableJournal.cs' [73' 94])' PostgresqlTableJournal (C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\Postgresql\PostgresqlTableJournal.cs' [72' 93])
Unfactored Hierarchy,DbUp.Support.Postgresql,PostgresqlTableJournal,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\Postgresql\PostgresqlTableJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  PostgresqlTableJournal (C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\Postgresql\PostgresqlTableJournal.cs' [56' 85])' SqlTableJournal (C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\SqlServer\SqlTableJournal.cs' [47' 76])
Unfactored Hierarchy,DbUp.Support.Postgresql,PostgresqlTableJournal,C:\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\DbUp\Support\Postgresql\PostgresqlTableJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
