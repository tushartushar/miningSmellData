(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,DbUp.Oracle,OracleTableJournal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\dbup-oracle\OracleTableJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: EnsureTableExistsAndIsLatestVersion
Deficient Encapsulation,DbUp.Oracle,OracleTableJournal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\dbup-oracle\OracleTableJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: English
Deficient Encapsulation,DbUp.Oracle,OracleTableJournal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\dbup-oracle\OracleTableJournal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: English
Broken Hierarchy,DbUp.Oracle,OracleObjectParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\dbup-oracle\OracleObjectParser.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DbUp.Support.SqlObjectParser
Rebellious Hierarchy,DbUp.Oracle,OraclePreprocessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\dbup-oracle\OraclePreprocessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Process
Rebellious Hierarchy,DbUp.Oracle,OracleScriptExecutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DbUp_DbUp\src\dbup-oracle\OracleScriptExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
