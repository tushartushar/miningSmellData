Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,DbUp,DbUp,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DbUp.Builder
Unstable Dependency,DbUp,DbUp.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DbUp.Builder' DbUp.Engine.Transactions
Unstable Dependency,DbUp,DbUp.Engine.Transactions,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DbUp.Support.SqlServer
Unstable Dependency,DbUp,DbUp.Helpers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DbUp.Support.SqlServer
Feature Concentration,DbUp,DbUp.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
