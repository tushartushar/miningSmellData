(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,UIAComWrapperTests,ObjectTestMapping,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\Internal_ObjectConverterTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: property' input' expected
Insufficient Modularization,UIAComWrapperTests,AutomationElementTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\AutomationElementTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,UIAComWrapperTests,MockPatternProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\MockPatternTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UIAComWrapperTests.MockPatternProvider' UIAComWrapperTests.MockTextRangeProvider
Broken Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,FocusChangeHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\EventTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UIAComWrapperTests.EventHandlerBase
Broken Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,BasicChangeHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\EventTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UIAComWrapperTests.EventHandlerBase
Broken Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,PropertyChangeHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\EventTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UIAComWrapperTests.EventHandlerBase
Broken Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,StructureChangeHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\EventTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): UIAComWrapperTests.EventHandlerBase
Multipath Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,MockPatternProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\MockPatternTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ITextProvider
Rebellious Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,MockPatternProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\MockPatternTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Move' Resize' Rotate
Rebellious Hierarchy,UIAComWrapperTests,MockTextRangeProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JakeGinnivan_UIAComWrapper\UiaComWrapperTests\MockPatternTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone' Compare' CompareEndpoints' ExpandToEnclosingUnit' GetAttributeValue' GetBoundingRectangles' GetEnclosingElement' Move' MoveEndpointByUnit' MoveEndpointByRange' Select' AddToSelection' RemoveFromSelection' GetChildren
