Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SurfaceDemo,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,SurfaceDemo,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SurfaceDemo.App' MobiusDemo.App
Unutilized Abstraction,SurfaceDemo,Window1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SurfaceDemo,Window1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateSurface which is more interested in members of the type: ViewModel
Unutilized Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RelayCommand<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs' [3' 26])' RelayCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand.cs' [3' 26])
Duplicate Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RelayCommand<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs' [55' 96])' RelayCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand.cs' [54' 95])
Unutilized Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SurfaceDemo.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,SurfaceDemo,Window1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
