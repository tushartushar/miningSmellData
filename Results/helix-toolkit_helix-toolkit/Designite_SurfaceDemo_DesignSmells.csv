Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SurfaceDemo,App,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,SurfaceDemo,App,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SurfaceDemo.App' MobiusDemo.App
Unutilized Abstraction,SurfaceDemo,Window1,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand<T>,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand<T>,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RelayCommand<T> (C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs' [3' 26])' RelayCommand (C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand.cs' [3' 26])
Duplicate Abstraction,MvvmFoundation.Wpf,RelayCommand<T>,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RelayCommand<T> (C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand{T}.cs' [55' 96])' RelayCommand (C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Commands\RelayCommand.cs' [54' 95])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SurfaceDemo.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,SurfaceDemo,Window1,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF\SurfaceDemo\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
