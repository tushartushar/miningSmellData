Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,CustomLinesVertex,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\SelectableLineGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' Color' Parameters' SizeInBytes
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,CustomPointsVertex,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\SelectablePointGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' Color' Parameters' SizeInBytes
Imperative Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,CustomGeometryModel3D,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,MainViewModel,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,MainWindow,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomLinesVertex,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\SelectableLineGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Color' Parameters
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomPointsVertex,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\SelectablePointGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Color' Parameters
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomVertex,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Color' TexCoord' Normal' Tangent' BiTangent' CustomParams
Broken Modularization,CustomShaderDemo,CustomVertex,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomGeometryModel3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' Color' TexCoord' Normal' Tangent' BiTangent' CustomParams' SizeInBytes
Broken Hierarchy,CustomShaderDemo,MainViewModel,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DemoCore.BaseViewModel
