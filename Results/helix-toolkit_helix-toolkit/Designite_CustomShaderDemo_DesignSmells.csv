Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,CustomShaderNames,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DataSampling' NoiseMesh' TexData' TexDataSampler
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,CustomVSShaderDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VSMeshDataSamplerByteCode' VSDataSampling
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,CustomPSShaderDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PSDataSampling' PSNoiseMesh
Unutilized Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomShaderDemo.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomVSShaderDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VSDataSampling
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomVSShaderDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VSDataSampling
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomPSShaderDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PSDataSampling' PSNoiseMesh
Deficient Encapsulation,CustomShaderDemo,CustomPSShaderDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\CustomEffectsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PSDataSampling' PSNoiseMesh
Broken Hierarchy,CustomShaderDemo,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\CustomShaderDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DemoCore.BaseViewModel
