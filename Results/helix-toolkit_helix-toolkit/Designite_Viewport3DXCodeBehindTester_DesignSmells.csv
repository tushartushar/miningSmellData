Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester,ViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EnableButtons' EnableEnvironmentButtons' enableButtons' enableEnvironmentButtons
Unnecessary Abstraction,Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Light3D' EnvironmentMap3D (in method "Button_Click_Remove" of class "MainWindow").
Broken Hierarchy,Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester,ViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\Viewport3DXCodeBehindTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DemoCore.BaseViewModel
