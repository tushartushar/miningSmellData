Imperative Abstraction,CoreTest,CoreTestApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\CoreTestApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RequestResize
Feature Envy,CoreTest,CoreTestApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\CoreTestApp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Window_MouseUp which is more interested in members of the type: CameraController
Feature Envy,CoreTest,CoreTestApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\CoreTestApp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Window_MouseDown which is more interested in members of the type: CameraController
Feature Envy,CoreTest,CoreTestApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\CoreTestApp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Window_MouseWheel which is more interested in members of the type: CameraController
Imperative Abstraction,CoreTest,SceneUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\SceneUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DrawUI
Imperative Abstraction,HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.Model,ImGuiNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ImGuiNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Update
Imperative Abstraction,HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.Model,ImGuiRenderCore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ImGuiNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Render
Unnecessary Abstraction,CoreTest.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CoreTest,SceneUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\SceneUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SomeTextFromOutside' scene
Deficient Encapsulation,CoreTest,SceneUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\SceneUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SomeTextFromOutside' scene
Deficient Encapsulation,CoreTest,ViewportOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ViewportControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DirectionalLightFollowCamera' WalkAround' EnableSSAO' EnableFXAA' EnableFrustum' ShowRenderDetail' BackgroundColor' DirectionLightIntensity' AmbientLightIntensity' ShowWireframe' ShowWireframeChanged' PlayAnimation' AnimationUpdater' Viewport' ShowEnvironmentMap
Deficient Encapsulation,HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.Model,ImGuiRenderCore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ImGuiNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TextureView
Deficient Encapsulation,HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.Model,ImGui2DBufferModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ImGuiNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SpriteCount' IndexCount
Broken Modularization,CoreTest,ViewportOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ViewportControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DirectionalLightFollowCamera' WalkAround' EnableSSAO' EnableFXAA' EnableFrustum' ShowRenderDetail' BackgroundColor' DirectionLightIntensity' AmbientLightIntensity' ShowWireframe' ShowWireframeChanged' PlayAnimation' AnimationUpdater' Viewport' ShowEnvironmentMap
Multipath Hierarchy,HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.Model,ImGui2DBufferModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ImGuiNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IGUID
Broken Hierarchy,HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.Model,ImGui2DBufferModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\SharpDX.Core\CoreTest\ImGuiNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.ReferenceCountDisposeObject' HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.IGUID' HelixToolkit.SharpDX.Core.IAttachableBufferModel
