Unutilized Abstraction,OctreeDemo,BindingProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OctreeDemo,BindingProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BindingProxy (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\MainViewModel.cs' [361' 384])' BindingProxy (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\MainViewModel.cs' [388' 411])
Unutilized Abstraction,OctreeDemo,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OctreeDemo.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,OctreeDemo,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\OctreeDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: DataModel' DataModel (in method "OnMouseLeftButtonDownHandler" of class "MainViewModel").
