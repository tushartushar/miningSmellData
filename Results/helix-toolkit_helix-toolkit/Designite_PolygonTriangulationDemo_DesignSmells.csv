Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PolygonTriangulationDemo,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\PolygonTriangulationDemo\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PolygonTriangulationDemo,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\PolygonTriangulationDemo\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MainWindow which is more interested in members of the type: MainViewModel
Unnecessary Abstraction,PolygonTriangulationDemo.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\PolygonTriangulationDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,PolygonTriangulationDemo,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\PolygonTriangulationDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LineGeometry
Broken Hierarchy,PolygonTriangulationDemo,MainViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\PolygonTriangulationDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DemoCore.BaseViewModel
