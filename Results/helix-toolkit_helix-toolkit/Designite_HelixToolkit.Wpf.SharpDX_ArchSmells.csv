Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): SharpDX.Toolkit.Graphics' HelixToolkit.Wpf
Unstable Dependency,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX' HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Utilities
Unstable Dependency,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Model.Lights3D,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX
Unstable Dependency,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Utilities,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX
God Component,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 193
God Component,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,SharpDX.Toolkit.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 37
Feature Concentration,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Box3]' [Color4Collection' ExposedArrayList' IntCollection' Vector2Collection' Vector3Collection]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
Scattered Functionality,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX,HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Utilities,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX' HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.Extensions
