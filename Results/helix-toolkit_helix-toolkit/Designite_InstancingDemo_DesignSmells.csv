Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,InstancingDemo,App,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,InstancingDemo,MainViewModel,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnMouseLeftButtonDownHandler
Unutilized Abstraction,InstancingDemo,MainViewModel,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,InstancingDemo,MainWindow,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,InstancingDemo.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,InstancingDemo,MainViewModel,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: InstancingMeshGeometryModel3D' LineGeometryModel3D (in method "OnMouseLeftButtonDownHandler" of class "MainViewModel").
Broken Hierarchy,InstancingDemo,MainViewModel,C:\repos\helix-toolkit_helix-toolkit\Source\Examples\WPF.SharpDX\InstancingDemo\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DemoCore.BaseViewModel
