Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AzureQuickStarts.Common,CertificateAuthenticationHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SyntaxC4-MSFT_AzureQuickStartsProjects\Compute\DeployManageVirtualMachines\CertificateAuthenticationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AzureQuickStarts.Common,PublishSettingsSubscriptionItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SyntaxC4-MSFT_AzureQuickStartsProjects\Compute\DeployManageVirtualMachines\PublishSettingsSubscriptionItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubscriptionId' ManagementCertificate' SubscriptionName
Feature Envy,DeployManageVirtualMachines,VMManagementController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SyntaxC4-MSFT_AzureQuickStartsProjects\Compute\DeployManageVirtualMachines\VMManagementController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateVirtualMachine which is more interested in members of the type: VMManagementControllerParameters
Imperative Abstraction,DeployManageVirtualMachines,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SyntaxC4-MSFT_AzureQuickStartsProjects\Compute\DeployManageVirtualMachines\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Broken Modularization,DeployManageVirtualMachines,VMManagementControllerParameters,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SyntaxC4-MSFT_AzureQuickStartsProjects\Compute\DeployManageVirtualMachines\VMManagementControllerParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Region' StorageAccountName' StorageAccountType' CloudServiceName' VMName' PublishSettingsFilePath' AdminUsername' AdminPassword' RDPPort
