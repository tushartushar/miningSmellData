Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,BaseRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\BaseRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,MapQuestGeocoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\MapQuestGeocoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,MapQuestLocation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\MapQuestLocation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unnecessary Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,MapQuestResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\MapQuestResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Results' Options' Info
Unnecessary Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,MapQuestResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\MapQuestResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Locations' ProvidedLocation
Unnecessary Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,RequestOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\RequestOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxResults' ThumbMap' IgnoreLatLngInput' JsonpCallBack' _maxResults
Unnecessary Abstraction,Geocoding.MapQuest,ResponseInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\ResponseInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Copyright' Status' Messages
Broken Modularization,Geocoding.MapQuest,RequestOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\RequestOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxResults' ThumbMap' IgnoreLatLngInput' JsonpCallBack' _maxResults
Rebellious Hierarchy,Geocoding.MapQuest,MapQuestGeocoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.MapQuest\MapQuestGeocoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReverseGeocodeAsync
