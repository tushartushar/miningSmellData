Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Geocoding.Google,GoogleComponentFilterType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.Google\GoogleComponentFilterType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AdministrativeArea' PostalCode' Country
Unutilized Abstraction,Geocoding.Google,GoogleComponentFilterType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.Google\GoogleComponentFilterType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geocoding.Google,GoogleGeocoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.Google\GoogleGeocoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Geocoding.Google,GoogleViewport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.Google\GoogleViewport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Northeast' Southwest
Broken Hierarchy,Geocoding.Google,GoogleAddress,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chadly_Geocoding.net\src\Geocoding.Google\GoogleAddress.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Geocoding.Address
