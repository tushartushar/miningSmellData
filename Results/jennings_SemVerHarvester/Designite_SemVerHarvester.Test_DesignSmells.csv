Insufficient Modularization,SemVerHarvester.Test,SemVerHgHarvesterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jennings_SemVerHarvester\SemVerHarvester.Test\SemVerHgHarvesterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
