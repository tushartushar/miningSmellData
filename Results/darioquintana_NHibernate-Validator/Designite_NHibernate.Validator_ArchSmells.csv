Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Cfg,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Validator.Cfg.MappingSchema
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Cfg.Loquacious,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Validator.Cfg.Loquacious.Impl
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Constraints,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Validator.Engine
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Validator.Interpolator' NHibernate.Validator.Mappings' NHibernate.Validator.Cfg.MappingSchema' NHibernate.Validator.Cfg
Unstable Dependency,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Mappings,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): NHibernate.Validator.Cfg.MappingSchema
Ambiguous Interface,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Exceptions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: InvalidStateException
God Component,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Constraints,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 31
God Component,NHibernate.Validator,NHibernate.Validator.Cfg.MappingSchema,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 32
