Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,OpenVPNUtils,UserSpaceConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\UserSpaceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: killtimer which is more interested in members of the type: UserSpaceService
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenVPNUtils.States,StateSnapshot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\States\StateSnapshot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionState' VPNState
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,Connection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.Connection' OpenVPNUtils.LogManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,ManagementLogic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\ManagementLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic' OpenVPNUtils.Connection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,ManagementParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\ManagementParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.ManagementParser' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils.States,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\States\State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.States.State' OpenVPNUtils.Connection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,Connection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.Connection' OpenVPNUtils.LogManager' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,ManagementParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\ManagementParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.ManagementParser' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic' OpenVPNUtils.Connection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils.States,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\States\State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.States.State' OpenVPNUtils.Connection' OpenVPNUtils.LogManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,Connection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.Connection' OpenVPNUtils.LogManager' OpenVPNUtils.Communicator' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils.States,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\States\State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.States.State' OpenVPNUtils.Connection' OpenVPNUtils.LogManager' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenVPNUtils,Connection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jochenwierum_openvpn-manager\OpenVPN\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenVPNUtils.Connection' OpenVPNUtils.LogManager' OpenVPNUtils.Communicator' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementParser' OpenVPNUtils.ManagementLogic
