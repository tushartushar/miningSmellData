Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.Loader,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.Loader,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Gallio.Loader,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Gallio.Loader.NamespaceDoc' Gallio.Loader.Isolation.NamespaceDoc' Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment.NamespaceDoc
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.Loader,VersionPolicy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.VersionPolicy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.Loader.Isolation,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.Isolation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.Loader.Isolation,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.Isolation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.Loader.Isolation,IIsolatedEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.Isolation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AppDomain' Loader
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment,SharedEnvironmentManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.SharedEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Gallio.Loader.Isolation,IsolatedEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\SDK\Loader\Gallio.Loader.Isolation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Resolve' Resolve
