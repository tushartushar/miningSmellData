Feature Envy,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,CommandProgressMonitorPresenter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\CommandProgressMonitorPresenter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleChanged which is more interested in members of the type: BaseCommand
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,GallioSnapIn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\GallioSnapIn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' Name' Vendor
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,GallioSnapIn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\GallioSnapIn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,BaseCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\BaseCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gallio.PowerShellCommands.BaseCommand' Gallio.PowerShellCommands.CommandProgressMonitorProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,CommandLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\CommandLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gallio.PowerShellCommands.CommandLogger' Gallio.PowerShellCommands.BaseCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,BaseCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\BaseCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gallio.PowerShellCommands.BaseCommand' Gallio.PowerShellCommands.CommandProgressMonitorPresenter' Gallio.PowerShellCommands.CommandProgressMonitorProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gallio.PowerShellCommands,CommandProgressMonitorProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\PowerShell\Gallio.PowerShellCommands\CommandProgressMonitorProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
