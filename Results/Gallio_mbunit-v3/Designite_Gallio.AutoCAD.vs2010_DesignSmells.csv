Duplicate Abstraction,Gallio.AutoCAD,IAcadPluginLocator,C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\IAcadPluginLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IAcadPluginLocator (C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\IAcadPluginLocator.cs' [1' 20])' IAcadLocator (C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\IAcadLocator.cs' [1' 20])' AcadCommandRunner (C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\Commands\AcadCommandRunner.cs' [1' 20])' AcadProcessBase (C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\ProcessManagement\AcadProcessBase.cs' [1' 20])
Imperative Abstraction,Gallio.AutoCAD,AcadPluginLocator,C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\AcadPluginLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetPluginPath
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.AutoCAD.Preferences,IAcadPreferenceManager,C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\Preferences\IAcadPreferenceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CommandLineArguments' StartupAction' UserSpecifiedExecutable' WorkingDirectory
Imperative Abstraction,Gallio.AutoCAD.ProcessManagement,AcadProcessFactory,C:\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Extensions\AutoCAD\Gallio.AutoCAD\ProcessManagement\AcadProcessFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateProcess
