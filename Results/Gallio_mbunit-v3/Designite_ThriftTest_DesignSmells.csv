Duplicate Abstraction,Test,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\tools\Thrift\src\test\csharp\ThriftTest\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\tools\Thrift\src\test\csharp\ThriftTest\Program.cs' [1' 23])' TestServer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\tools\Thrift\src\test\csharp\ThriftTest\TestServer.cs' [1' 23])
Imperative Abstraction,Test,TestServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\tools\Thrift\src\test\csharp\ThriftTest\TestServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,TestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\tools\Thrift\src\test\csharp\ThriftTest\TestServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: server
Insufficient Modularization,Test,TestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\tools\Thrift\src\test\csharp\ThriftTest\TestServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods).
