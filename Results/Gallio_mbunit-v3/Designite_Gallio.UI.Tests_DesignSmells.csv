Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallio.UI.Tests.Events,TestEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\Events\EventAggregatorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.UI.Tests.Events,EventHandlerProxyTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\Events\EventHandlerProxyTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,Gallio.UI.Tests.ProgressMonitoring,ToolStripProgressBarTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\ProgressMonitoring\ToolStripProgressBarTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Maximum_should_be_total_work_units which is more interested in members of the type: ToolStripProgressBar
Feature Envy,Gallio.UI.Tests.ProgressMonitoring,ToolStripProgressBarTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\ProgressMonitoring\ToolStripProgressBarTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Value_should_be_completed_work_units which is more interested in members of the type: ToolStripProgressBar
Feature Envy,Gallio.UI.Tests.ProgressMonitoring,ToolStripProgressBarTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\ProgressMonitoring\ToolStripProgressBarTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Style_should_be_continuous_if_work_is_in_progress which is more interested in members of the type: ToolStripProgressBar
Feature Envy,Gallio.UI.Tests.ProgressMonitoring,ToolStripProgressBarTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\ProgressMonitoring\ToolStripProgressBarTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Style_should_be_marquee_if_total_work_units_is_NaN which is more interested in members of the type: ToolStripProgressBar
Feature Envy,Gallio.UI.Tests.ProgressMonitoring,ToolStripProgressBarTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\ProgressMonitoring\ToolStripProgressBarTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Maximum_should_be_zero_if_work_is_done which is more interested in members of the type: ToolStripProgressBar
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.UI.Tests.Tree.NodeControls,NodeCheckBoxTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\Tree\NodeControls\NodeCheckBoxTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallio.UI.Tests.Tree.Node,ThreeStateNodeTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\Tree\Node\ThreeStateNodeTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Gallio.UI.Tests.Tree.NodeControls,TestNodeCheckBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Gallio_mbunit-v3\src\Gallio\Gallio.UI.Tests\Tree\NodeControls\NodeCheckBoxTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gallio.UI.Tree.NodeControls.NodeCheckBox
