Imperative Abstraction,CDPaint2,Form1,C:\repos\rhfung_KinematicTemplates\KTCursor\examples\CDPaint2\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetInstance
Multifaceted Abstraction,CDPaint2,Form1,C:\repos\rhfung_KinematicTemplates\KTCursor\examples\CDPaint2\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unnecessary Abstraction,CDPaint2.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\rhfung_KinematicTemplates\KTCursor\examples\CDPaint2\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CDPaint2.Canvas,Command,C:\repos\rhfung_KinematicTemplates\KTCursor\examples\CDPaint2\Canvas\Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Render
Insufficient Modularization,CDPaint2,Form1,C:\repos\rhfung_KinematicTemplates\KTCursor\examples\CDPaint2\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,CDPaint2,Form1,C:\repos\rhfung_KinematicTemplates\KTCursor\examples\CDPaint2\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 113
