Unnecessary Abstraction,SEMTools4CD.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\kleinsimon_SemTools4CD\SEMDock\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' LastData' LastDir' calibList' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,SEMTools4CD,semImage,C:\repos\kleinsimon_SemTools4CD\SEMDock\Classes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: imgShape' imgData
Deficient Encapsulation,SEMTools4CD,SEMDock,C:\repos\kleinsimon_SemTools4CD\SEMDock\SEMDock.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: calibList
Insufficient Modularization,SEMTools4CD,SEMDock,C:\repos\kleinsimon_SemTools4CD\SEMDock\SEMDock.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Modularization,SEMTools4CD.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\kleinsimon_SemTools4CD\SEMDock\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' LastData' LastDir' calibList' defaultInstance
Broken Hierarchy,SEMTools4CD,BooleanToVisibilityConverter,C:\repos\kleinsimon_SemTools4CD\SEMDock\Classes.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BooleanConverter
