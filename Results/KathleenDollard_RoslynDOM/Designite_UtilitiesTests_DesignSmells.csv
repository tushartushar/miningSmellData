Unutilized Abstraction,TestRoslyn,ReflectionUtilitiesTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KathleenDollard_RoslynDOM\UtilitiesTests\ReflectionUtilitiesTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestRoslyn,B<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KathleenDollard_RoslynDOM\UtilitiesTests\ReflectionUtilitiesTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,TestRoslyn,StringUtilitiesTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KathleenDollard_RoslynDOM\UtilitiesTests\StringUtilitiesTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 54 public methods
