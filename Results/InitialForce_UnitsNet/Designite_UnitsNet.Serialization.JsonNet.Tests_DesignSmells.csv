Unutilized Abstraction,UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests,UnitsNetJsonConverterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\InitialForce_UnitsNet\UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests\UnitsNetJsonConverterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests,TestObj,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\InitialForce_UnitsNet\UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests\UnitsNetJsonConverterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NullableFrequency' NonNullableFrequency
Unnecessary Abstraction,UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests,TestObjWithIComparable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\InitialForce_UnitsNet\UnitsNet.Serialization.JsonNet.Tests\UnitsNetJsonConverterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
