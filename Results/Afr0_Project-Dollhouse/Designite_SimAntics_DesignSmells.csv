Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SimAntics,Simulator,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\Simulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SimAntics,Coroutine,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\Coroutine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: is_complete' can_move_next
Deficient Encapsulation,SimAntics,ObjectModule,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\ObjectModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Globals
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,ObjectModule,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\ObjectModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.ObjectModule' SimAntics.XObject
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,SimanticsThread,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\SimanticsThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.SimanticsThread' SimAntics.XMTObject
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,XMTObject,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XMTObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.XMTObject' SimAntics.SimanticsThread
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,XObject,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.XObject' SimAntics.ObjectModule
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,XObject,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.XObject' SimAntics.ObjectModule' SimAntics.XPerson
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,XPerson,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XPerson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.XPerson' SimAntics.ObjectModule
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimAntics,XPerson,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XPerson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimAntics.XPerson' SimAntics.ObjectModule' SimAntics.XObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,SimAntics,SimanticsThread,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\SimanticsThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: process
Broken Hierarchy,SimAntics,XObject,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XObject.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SimAntics.XMTObject
Broken Hierarchy,SimAntics,XPerson,C:\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\SimAntics\XPerson.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SimAntics.XMTObject
