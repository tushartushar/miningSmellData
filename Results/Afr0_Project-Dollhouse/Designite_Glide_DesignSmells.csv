Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Glide,Ease,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Ease.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Unutilized Abstraction,Glide,Ease,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Ease.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Glide,Tweener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Tweener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Glide,Ease,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Ease.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Glide,Ease,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Ease.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Glide,Tween,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Tween.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Glide.Tween' Glide.IRemoveTweens
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Glide,TweenerImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Tweener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Glide.TweenerImpl' Glide.Tween
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Glide,Tween,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Tween.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Glide.Tween' Glide.IRemoveTweens' Glide.TweenerImpl
Broken Hierarchy,Glide,Tweener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\Other\libs\Glide\Tweener.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Glide.TweenerImpl
