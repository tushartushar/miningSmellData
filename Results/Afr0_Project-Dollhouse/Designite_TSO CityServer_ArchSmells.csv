Cyclic Dependency,TSO CityServer,TSO_CityServer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: TSO_CityServer' TSO_CityServer.Network' TSO_CityServer.VM,TSO_CityServer.WebModule' TSO_CityServer.Program' TSO_CityServer.Network.ClientPacketHandlers' TSO_CityServer.VM.VM
Cyclic Dependency,TSO CityServer,TSO_CityServer.VM,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: TSO_CityServer.VM' TSO_CityServer' TSO_CityServer.Network' TSO_CityServer' TSO_CityServer.Network,TSO_CityServer.VM.VM' TSO_CityServer.WebModule' TSO_CityServer.Program' TSO_CityServer.Network.ClientPacketHandlers
Unstable Dependency,TSO CityServer,TSO_CityServer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): TSO_CityServer.VM,TSO_CityServer.VM
Feature Concentration,TSO CityServer,TSO_CityServer,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConfigurationManager' GlobalSettings' WebModule' Program' Settings' Logger]' [NancyExtensions]' [AppearanceType]' [Sim]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44,TSO_CityServer.NancyExtensions' TSO_CityServer.AppearanceType' TSO_CityServer.Sim
Feature Concentration,TSO CityServer,TSO_CityServer.Network,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
