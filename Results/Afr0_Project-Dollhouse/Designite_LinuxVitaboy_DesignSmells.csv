Feature Envy,Vitaboy,AvatarBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\Vitaboy\Vitaboy\AvatarBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CopyBodyVertices which is more interested in members of the type: Mesh
Deficient Encapsulation,Vitaboy,AvatarBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\Vitaboy\Vitaboy\AvatarBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Skel' HeadMesh' AccessoryMesh' BodyMesh' LeftHandMesh' RightHandMesh' LeftHandTexture' RightHandTexture' BodyTexture' HeadTexture' AccessoryTexture' Animation' RotationStartAngle' RotationSpeed' RotationRange' ShouldRotate
Broken Hierarchy,Vitaboy,AdultAvatar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\Vitaboy\Vitaboy\AdultAvatar.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Vitaboy.AvatarBase
Broken Hierarchy,Vitaboy,CatAvatar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\Vitaboy\Vitaboy\CatAvatar.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Vitaboy.AvatarBase
Broken Hierarchy,Vitaboy,ChildAvatar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\Vitaboy\Vitaboy\ChildAvatar.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Vitaboy.AvatarBase
Broken Hierarchy,Vitaboy,DogAvatar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Afr0_Project-Dollhouse\TSOClient\Vitaboy\Vitaboy\DogAvatar.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Vitaboy.AvatarBase
