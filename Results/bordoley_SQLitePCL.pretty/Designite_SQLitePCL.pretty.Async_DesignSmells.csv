Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SQLitePCL.pretty,AsyncDatabaseConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bordoley_SQLitePCL.pretty\SQLitePCL.pretty.Async\AsyncDatabaseConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SQLitePCL.pretty,AsyncStatement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bordoley_SQLitePCL.pretty\SQLitePCL.pretty.Async\AsyncStatement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SQLitePCL.pretty,OperationsQueueExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bordoley_SQLitePCL.pretty\SQLitePCL.pretty.Async\OperationsQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SQLitePCL.pretty,ResultSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bordoley_SQLitePCL.pretty\SQLitePCL.pretty.Async\ResultSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SQLitePCL.pretty,AsyncDatabaseConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bordoley_SQLitePCL.pretty\SQLitePCL.pretty.Async\AsyncDatabaseConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,SQLitePCL.pretty,AsyncBlobStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bordoley_SQLitePCL.pretty\SQLitePCL.pretty.Async\AsyncBlobStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' SetLength' Write
