Unutilized Abstraction,Toml,Document,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Document.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Toml,Entry,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,Toml,Group,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Group.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Toml,Parser,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Parser[332' 354]' Parser[360' 382]
Duplicate Abstraction,Toml,Parser,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Parser[332' 351]' Parser[386' 405]' Parser[360' 379]
Unutilized Abstraction,Toml,ParserException,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\ParserException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Toml,Serializer,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Write
Unutilized Abstraction,Toml,Serializer,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Array,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Array.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Array' Entry
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Array,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Array.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Array' Entry' Parser
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Entry,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Entry' Array' Parser' Array
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Entry,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Entry' Parser' Array' Parser' Array
Insufficient Modularization,Toml,Parser,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 141
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Parser,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Parser' Array
Broken Hierarchy,Toml,Document,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Document.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Group
Cyclic Hierarchy,Toml,Entry,C:\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Array
