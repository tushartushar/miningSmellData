Unnecessary Abstraction,Toml,Dimensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Array.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Depth' Length
Imperative Abstraction,Toml,Entry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Duplicate Abstraction,Toml,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Parser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs' [332' 354])' Parser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs' [360' 382])
Duplicate Abstraction,Toml,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Parser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs' [332' 351])' Parser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs' [386' 405])' Parser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs' [360' 379])
Imperative Abstraction,Toml,Serializer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Write
Unutilized Abstraction,Toml,Serializer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Serializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Toml,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 131
Broken Modularization,Toml,Errors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' InvalidValue' InvalidIdentifierCharacter' InvalidEscapeCharacter' IncompleteToken' UnexpectedArrayTerminator' UnexpectedNewLineInString' UnexpectedNewLineInKeyName' UnexpectedCommentInValue' KeyNameIsEmpty' IdentifierNameIsEmpty' ExpectingIdentifier' ExpectingAssignmentOperator' ExpectingArraySeparator
Broken Modularization,Toml,Tokens,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' GroupSeparator' Comment' Negative' Decimal' KeyStart' KeySeparator' KeyEnd' ArrayStart' ArraySeparator' ArrayEnd' ValueSeparator' EscapeChar' QuoteStart' QuoteEnd' MultiLineQuoteStart' MultiLineQuoteEnd' MultiLineQuoteStartToken' MultiLineQuoteEndToken' EmptyStringToken
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Array,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Array.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Toml.Array' Toml.Entry
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Toml.Parser' Toml.Array
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Toml,Array,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Array.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Toml.Array' Toml.Entry' Toml.Parser
Broken Hierarchy,Toml,Document,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Document.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Toml.Group
Cyclic Hierarchy,Toml,Entry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LBreedlove_Toml.net\Toml\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Array
