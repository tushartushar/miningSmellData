Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,de4dot.mdecrypt,DecryptMethodsInfo,C:\repos\UbbeLoL_ConfuserDeobfuscator\ConfuserDeobfuscator\de4dot\de4dot.mdecrypt\DecryptMethodsInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' moduleCctorBytes' methodsToDecrypt
Duplicate Abstraction,de4dot.mdecrypt,DecryptMethodsInfo,C:\repos\UbbeLoL_ConfuserDeobfuscator\ConfuserDeobfuscator\de4dot\de4dot.mdecrypt\DecryptMethodsInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DecryptMethodsInfo[1' 20]' DynamicMethodsDecrypter[1' 20]' NativeCodeGenerator[1' 20]
Duplicate Abstraction,de4dot.mdecrypt,DecryptMethodsInfo,C:\repos\UbbeLoL_ConfuserDeobfuscator\ConfuserDeobfuscator\de4dot\de4dot.mdecrypt\DecryptMethodsInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DecryptMethodsInfo[1' 21]' NativeCodeGenerator[1' 21]
Multifaceted Abstraction,de4dot.mdecrypt,DynamicMethodsDecrypter,C:\repos\UbbeLoL_ConfuserDeobfuscator\ConfuserDeobfuscator\de4dot\de4dot.mdecrypt\DynamicMethodsDecrypter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Deficient Encapsulation,de4dot.mdecrypt,DecryptMethodsInfo,C:\repos\UbbeLoL_ConfuserDeobfuscator\ConfuserDeobfuscator\de4dot\de4dot.mdecrypt\DecryptMethodsInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: moduleCctorBytes' methodsToDecrypt
Insufficient Modularization,de4dot.mdecrypt,DynamicMethodsDecrypter,C:\repos\UbbeLoL_ConfuserDeobfuscator\ConfuserDeobfuscator\de4dot\de4dot.mdecrypt\DynamicMethodsDecrypter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
