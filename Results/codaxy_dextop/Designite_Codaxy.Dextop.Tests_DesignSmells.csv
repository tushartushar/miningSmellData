Deficient Encapsulation,Codaxy.Dextop.Api,DisposableController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\Api\ControllerResolvingTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Disposed
Deficient Encapsulation,PetaTest,ResultsWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\PetaTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Verbose
Deficient Encapsulation,PetaTest,Tag,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\PetaTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Attributes
Insufficient Modularization,PetaTest,Assert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\PetaTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 64 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PetaTest,Assert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\PetaTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 69 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Codaxy.Dextop.Tests.Helpers,DextopTestApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\Helpers\DextopTestApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RegisterModules
Broken Hierarchy,PetaTest,TestFixtureAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\PetaTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PetaTest.TestBaseAttribute
Broken Hierarchy,PetaTest,TestAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\PetaTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PetaTest.TestBaseAttribute
Rebellious Hierarchy,Codaxy.Dextop.Tests.Tests.Dev,Demo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codaxy_dextop\Tests\Codaxy.Dextop.Tests\Tests\Dev\ConstructorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: InitRemotable
