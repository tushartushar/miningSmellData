Unnecessary Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,EContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\EContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description' Executables
Unutilized Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,EContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\EContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,EContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\EContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EContext[3' 22]' ExContext[3' 22]' RContext[3' 22]
Unnecessary Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,ExContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\ExContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description' Behaviors
Unutilized Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,ExContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\ExContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,Extensions,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,IBContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\IBContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description
Unutilized Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,IBContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\IBContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unnecessary Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Contexts,RContext,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Contexts\RContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Extensions' Run' Shutdown
Unnecessary Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Reports,Reporter,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Reports\Reporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Multifaceted Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Vhpt,DoorSensor,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Vhpt\DoorSensor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Duplicate Abstraction,SensorLegacy.Vhpt,VhptBlackHoleSubOrbitDetectionEngine,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Vhpt\VhptBlackHoleSubOrbitDetectionEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: VhptBlackHoleSubOrbitDetectionEngine[3' 23]' VhptDoor[3' 23]
Broken Hierarchy,SensorLegacy.Events,BlackHoleSensor,C:\repos\bbvch_sensorlegacy\source\SensorLegacy\Events\BlackHoleSensor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Notifier
