Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleHelpersTests,TestInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\SimpleHelpersTests\ObjectDiffPatchTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StringProperty
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleHelpersTests,TestCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\SimpleHelpersTests\ObjectDiffPatchTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' List
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleHelpersTests,TestCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\SimpleHelpersTests\ObjectDiffPatchTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: List
Insufficient Modularization,SimpleHelpersTests,ObjectDiffPatchTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\SimpleHelpersTests\ObjectDiffPatchTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
