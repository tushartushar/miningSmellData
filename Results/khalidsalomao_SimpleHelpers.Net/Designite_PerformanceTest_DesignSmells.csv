Unutilized Abstraction,PerformanceTest.Logging,LogExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,PerformanceTest.Logging.LogProviders,NLogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Log
Imperative Abstraction,PerformanceTest.Logging.LogProviders,Log4NetLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Log
Imperative Abstraction,PerformanceTest.Logging.LogProviders,SerilogLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Log
Unutilized Abstraction,PerformanceTest.Logging.LogProviders,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PerformanceTest,KeyValueObj,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\MockObjectGen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' Value
Insufficient Modularization,PerformanceTest.Logging,LogExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PerformanceTest.Logging,LogExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Broken Modularization,PerformanceTest,MockUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\MockObjectGen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Login' Name' SessionId' Group' Desc' Tel1' Cel1' Email' IsEnabled' Password' Question' QuestionAnswer' IsSystemAdmin' Parameters' List' m_parameters' m_list
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceTest.Logging,LogProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceTest.Logging.LogProvider' PerformanceTest.Logging.LoggerExecutionWrapper
Rebellious Hierarchy,PerformanceTest.Logging.LogProviders,LogProviderBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidsalomao_SimpleHelpers.Net\PerformanceTest\App_Packages\LibLog.4.2\LibLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetLogger
