Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerStudio.Debugger,PowerShellDebuggerEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellDebuggerEvents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerStudio.Debugger,PowerShellPortSupplier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellPortSupplier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PowerStudio.Debugger,PowerShellProcess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellProcess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PowerShellProcess (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellProcess.cs' [1' 23])' PowerShellProgramNode (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellProgramNode.cs' [1' 23])
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerStudio.Debugger,PowerShellProgramProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellProgramProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,PowerStudio.Debugger,PowerShellProgramProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IntelliTect_PowerStudio\source\PowerStudio.Debugger\PowerShellProgramProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PowerStudio.DebugEngine.DebugProgramProvider
