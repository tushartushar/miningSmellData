Insufficient Modularization,winswTests,ServiceDescriptorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kohsuke_winsw\src\Test\winswTests\ServiceDescriptorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
