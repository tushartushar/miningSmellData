Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,ProcessExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: StartProcessAsCurrentUser
Unutilized Abstraction,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,ProcessExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,PROCESS_INFORMATION,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' hProcess' hThread' dwProcessId' dwThreadId
Unnecessary Abstraction,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,WTS_SESSION_INFO,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SessionID' pWinStationName' State
Deficient Encapsulation,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,PROCESS_INFORMATION,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: hProcess' hThread' dwProcessId' dwThreadId
Deficient Encapsulation,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,STARTUPINFO,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cb' lpReserved' lpDesktop' lpTitle' dwX' dwY' dwXSize' dwYSize' dwXCountChars' dwYCountChars' dwFillAttribute' dwFlags' wShowWindow' cbReserved2' lpReserved2' hStdInput' hStdOutput' hStdError
Broken Modularization,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,STARTUPINFO,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' cb' lpReserved' lpDesktop' lpTitle' dwX' dwY' dwXSize' dwYSize' dwXCountChars' dwYCountChars' dwFillAttribute' dwFlags' wShowWindow' cbReserved2' lpReserved2' hStdInput' hStdOutput' hStdError
