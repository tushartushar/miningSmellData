This class contains only the following public method: StartProcessAsCurrentUser
Unnecessary Abstraction,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,PROCESS_INFORMATION,C:\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' hProcess' hThread' dwProcessId' dwThreadId
Unnecessary Abstraction,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,WTS_SESSION_INFO,C:\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SessionID' pWinStationName' State
Deficient Encapsulation,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,PROCESS_INFORMATION,C:\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: hProcess' hThread' dwProcessId' dwThreadId
Deficient Encapsulation,murrayju.ProcessExtensions,STARTUPINFO,C:\repos\murrayju_CreateProcessAsUser\ProcessExtensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
