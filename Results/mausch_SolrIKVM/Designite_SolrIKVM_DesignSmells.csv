Deficient Encapsulation,SolrIKVM,JavaInputStream,C:\repos\mausch_SolrIKVM\SolrIKVM\JavaInputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Wrapped
Deficient Encapsulation,SolrIKVM,JavaOutputStream,C:\repos\mausch_SolrIKVM\SolrIKVM\JavaOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Wrapped
Deficient Encapsulation,SolrIKVM,Setup,C:\repos\mausch_SolrIKVM\SolrIKVM\Setup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Port
Deficient Encapsulation,SolrIKVM,Setup,C:\repos\mausch_SolrIKVM\SolrIKVM\Setup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Port
Insufficient Modularization,SolrIKVM,ServletRequestAdapter,C:\repos\mausch_SolrIKVM\SolrIKVM\ServletRequestAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 55 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SolrIKVM,ServletRequestAdapter,C:\repos\mausch_SolrIKVM\SolrIKVM\ServletRequestAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
