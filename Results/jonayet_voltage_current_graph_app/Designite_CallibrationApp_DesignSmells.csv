Multifaceted Abstraction,CallibrationApp,HidBatteryAnalyzerManager,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\CallibrationApp\HidBatteryAnalyzerManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Unnecessary Abstraction,CallibrationApp.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\CallibrationApp\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CallibrationApp,AnalogDataReceivedEventArgs,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\CallibrationApp\HidBatteryAnalyzerManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentData
Deficient Encapsulation,CallibrationApp,RingBuffer,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\CallibrationApp\RingBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OnRequiredLengthOfDataAvilable
