Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,VoltageCurrentGraphApp,Oscilloscope,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\VoltageCurrentGraphApp\Oscilloscope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,VoltageCurrentGraphApp,VoltageCurrentGraphUI,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\VoltageCurrentGraphApp\VoltageCurrentGraphUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Unnecessary Abstraction,VoltageCurrentGraphApp.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\VoltageCurrentGraphApp\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,VoltageCurrentGraphApp,AnalogDataReceivedEventArgs,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\VoltageCurrentGraphApp\HidBatteryAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentData
Deficient Encapsulation,INFRA.USB,RingBuffer,C:\repos\jonayet_voltage_current_graph_app\VoltageCurrentGraphApp\RingBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OnRequiredLengthOfDataAvilable
