Feature Envy,Presentation.AnimationPresentation,ExplicitCustom,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Seminars\2012-09-20-CoreAnimation\AnimationPresentation\ExplicitCustom.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Reset which is more interested in members of the type: PieChartLayer
Feature Envy,Presentation.AnimationPresentation,ExplicitCustom,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Seminars\2012-09-20-CoreAnimation\AnimationPresentation\ExplicitCustom.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Basic which is more interested in members of the type: PieChartLayer
Broken Hierarchy,Presentation.AnimationPresentation,TransitionsView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Seminars\2012-09-20-CoreAnimation\AnimationPresentation\TransitionsView.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Presentation.DemoViewController

Unfactored Hierarchy,Presentation.AnimationPresentation,ExplicitBasic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Seminars\2012-09-20-CoreAnimation\AnimationPresentation\ExplicitBasic.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  ExplicitBasic (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Seminars\2012-09-20-CoreAnimation\AnimationPresentation\ExplicitBasic.cs' [16' 35])' ExplicitKeyframe (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_Seminars\2012-09-20-CoreAnimation\AnimationPresentation\ExplicitKeyframe.cs' [16' 35])
