Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,omodel,ConsoleProgram,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,omodel,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Unnecessary Abstraction,omodel,COORD,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y
Unnecessary Abstraction,omodel,SMALL_RECT,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Deficient Encapsulation,omodel,Program,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ModelFile' FastQuality' OutputFile' CompileOnlyIfNewer' OutputDependencyDirectory
Broken Modularization,omodel,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Broken Hierarchy,omodel,Program,C:\repos\AvengerDr_Odyssey\Source\Tools\omodel\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): omodel.ConsoleProgram
