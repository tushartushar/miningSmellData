Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,ByteArrayExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\ByteArrayExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,Code,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\Code.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,DateTimeExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\DateTimeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,DirectoryHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\DirectoryHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,HttpClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\HttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,IEnumerableExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\IEnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,MethodInfoExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\MethodInfoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MissingFeatures,RandomProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\RandomProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance' instance
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,StreamExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\StreamExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MissingFeatures,StringExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MissingFeatures,UserAgentStrings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\UserAgentStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AssemblyUserAgent' GoogleBot
Insufficient Modularization,MissingFeatures,StringExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NikolayIT_MissingFeatures.NET\MissingFeatures\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
