Duplicate Abstraction,Jose,RsaPssUsingSha,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\jws\RsaPssUsingSha.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RsaPssUsingSha (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\jws\RsaPssUsingSha.cs' [101' 130])' RsaPssUsingSha (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\jws\RsaPssUsingSha.cs' [134' 163])
Unutilized Abstraction,Jose,JWT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\JWT.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Jose,JwtOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\JwtOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EncodePayload' DetachPayload' Default
Multifaceted Abstraction,Jose.native,BCrypt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unnecessary Abstraction,Jose.native,BCRYPT_KEY_LENGTHS_STRUCT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwMinLength' dwMaxLength' dwIncrement
Unutilized Abstraction,Jose.native,BCRYPT_KEY_LENGTHS_STRUCT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Jose.native,BCRYPT_PSS_PADDING_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: pszAlgId' cbSalt
Deficient Encapsulation,Jose.native,BCRYPT_AUTHENTICATED_CIPHER_MODE_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cbSize' dwInfoVersion' pbNonce' cbNonce' pbAuthData' cbAuthData' pbTag' cbTag' pbMacContext' cbMacContext' cbAAD' cbData' dwFlags
Deficient Encapsulation,Jose.native,BCRYPT_KEY_LENGTHS_STRUCT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwMinLength' dwMaxLength' dwIncrement
Deficient Encapsulation,Jose.native,BCRYPT_OAEP_PADDING_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\BCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: pszAlgId' pbLabel' cbLabel
Deficient Encapsulation,Jose.native,NCryptBufferDesc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\NCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ulVersion' cBuffers' pBuffers
Deficient Encapsulation,Jose.native,NCryptBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\native\NCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cbBuffer' BufferType' pvBuffer
Insufficient Modularization,Jose,JWT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\JWT.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Jose,JwtSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dvsekhvalnov_jose-jwt\jose-jwt\JwtSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
