Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,jose-jwt.net40,Jose,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Jose' Security.Cryptography,Jose.AesGcm' Jose.EcdhKeyManagement' Jose.JWT' Security.Cryptography.EccKey
Unstable Dependency,jose-jwt.net40,Security.Cryptography,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Jose,Security.Cryptography.Arrays
God Component,jose-jwt.net40,Jose,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 42,Jose.JwsAlgorithm' Jose.JweAlgorithm' Jose.JweEncryption' Jose.JweCompression' Jose.ConcatKDF' Jose.Dictionaries' Jose.DeflateCompression' Jose.ICompression' Jose.PBKDF2' Jose.RsaOaep' Jose.IJsonMapper' Jose.JSSerializerMapper' Jose.DirectKeyManagement
Feature Concentration,jose-jwt.net40,Jose.native,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BCrypt' BCRYPT_AUTHENTICATED_CIPHER_MODE_INFO]' [BCRYPT_PSS_PADDING_INFO' NCrypt' NCryptBufferDesc' NCryptBuffer' BCRYPT_OAEP_PADDING_INFO]' [BCRYPT_KEY_LENGTHS_STRUCT]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,Jose.native.BCrypt' Jose.native.BCRYPT_AUTHENTICATED_CIPHER_MODE_INFO' Jose.native.BCRYPT_KEY_LENGTHS_STRUCT
