Unutilized Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,ArrangementTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\ArrangementTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,ExpressionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\ExpressionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,MatchInfoTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\MatchInfoTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,MockContextTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\MockContextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,IProp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\PropMock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ReadOnlyProperty' TwoWayProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,TheTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\TheTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LightMock.Tests,UnitTest1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\UnitTest1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,LightMock.Tests,MockContextTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\seesharper_LightMock\src\LightMock.Tests\MockContextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
