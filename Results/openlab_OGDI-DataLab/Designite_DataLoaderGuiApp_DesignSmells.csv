Imperative Abstraction,Tomers.WPF.MVVM,NotifyingObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\NotifyingObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: VerifyPropertyName
Duplicate Abstraction,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.Ressources,ViewR,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\Ressources\ViewR.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Feature Envy,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,SettingsWindowViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\SettingsWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SettingsWindowViewModel which is more interested in members of the type: DataLoaderSettings
Feature Envy,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,SettingsWindowViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\SettingsWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveSettings which is more interested in members of the type: DataLoaderSettings
Imperative Abstraction,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,MainViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnActivateItem
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,MainViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels.MainViewModel' Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.Views.UploaderControlView
Rebellious Hierarchy,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.Commands,CommandReference,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\Commands\CommandReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateInstanceCore
Broken Hierarchy,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,MatadataControlViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\MatadataControlViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tomers.WPF.MVVM.NotifyingObject
Broken Hierarchy,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,MetadataWindowViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\MetadataWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels.WorkspaceViewModel
Broken Hierarchy,Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels,SettingsWindowViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataLoader\DataLoaderGuiApp\ViewModels\SettingsWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ogdi.Data.DataLoaderGuiApp.ViewModels.WorkspaceViewModel
