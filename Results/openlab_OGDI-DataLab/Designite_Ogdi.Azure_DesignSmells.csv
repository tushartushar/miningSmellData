Unutilized Abstraction,Ogdi.Azure,AnalyticsRepository,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\Shared\Ogdi.Azure\AnalyticsRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Ogdi.Azure.Data,DatasetInfoDataSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\Shared\Ogdi.Azure\Data\DatasetInfoDataSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetOrCreateAnalyticInfo which is more interested in members of the type: DatasetInfoDataContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ogdi.Azure.QueueEntities,EMailMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\Shared\Ogdi.Azure\QueueEntities\EMailMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' To' Subject' Body' IsBodyHtml
Unutilized Abstraction,Ogdi.Azure.QueueEntities,EMailMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\Shared\Ogdi.Azure\QueueEntities\EMailMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Ogdi.Azure.Views,ViewDataSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\Shared\Ogdi.Azure\Views\ViewDataSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddView which is more interested in members of the type: ViewDataSourceContext

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: To' Subject' Body' IsBodyHtml
Broken Hierarchy,Ogdi.Azure,DataLoaderSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\Shared\Ogdi.Azure\Configuration\AppSettings.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ogdi.Azure.AppSettings
