Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.AspProviders,TableStorageMembershipProvider,C:\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataBrowser\Microsoft.Samples\AspProviders\TableStorageMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.AspProviders,TableStorageMembershipProvider,C:\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataBrowser\Microsoft.Samples\AspProviders\TableStorageMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.AspProviders,TableStorageMembershipProvider,C:\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataBrowser\Microsoft.Samples\AspProviders\TableStorageMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 158
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.AspProviders,TableStorageProfileProvider,C:\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataBrowser\Microsoft.Samples\AspProviders\TableStorageProfileProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 101
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.AspProviders,RoleRow,C:\repos\openlab_OGDI-DataLab\DataBrowser\Microsoft.Samples\AspProviders\TableStorageRoleProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
