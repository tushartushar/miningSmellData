Imperative Abstraction,IRCBot_GUI,AboutBox1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\AboutBox1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: description_box_LinkClicked
Duplicate Abstraction,IRCBot_GUI,server_config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Configuration\server_config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  server_config (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Configuration\server_config.cs' [215' 247])' server_config (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Configuration\server_config.cs' [404' 436])
Duplicate Abstraction,IRCBot_GUI,Interface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Interface (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs' [812' 844])' Interface (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs' [828' 860])
Unutilized Abstraction,IRCBot_GUI,SnapshotFlags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,IRCBot_GUI,FLASHWINFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' cbSize' hwnd' dwFlags' uCount' dwTimeout
Unnecessary Abstraction,IRCBot_GUI,ClientConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: config_path' auto_start' minimize_to_tray
Deficient Encapsulation,IRCBot_GUI,FLASHWINFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cbSize' hwnd' dwFlags' uCount' dwTimeout
Insufficient Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,Interface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,Interface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
Broken Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,PROCESSENTRY32,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MAX_PATH' dwSize' cntUsage' th32ProcessID' th32DefaultHeapID' th32ModuleID' cntThreads' th32ParentProcessID' pcPriClassBase' dwFlags' szExeFile
Broken Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,FLASHWINFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' cbSize' hwnd' dwFlags' uCount' dwTimeout
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Configuration\configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRCBot_GUI.configuration' IRCBot_GUI.server_config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,Interface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Interface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRCBot_GUI.Interface' IRCBot_GUI.configuration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IRCBot_GUI,configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_IRCBot\IRCBot-GUI\Configuration\configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRCBot_GUI.configuration' IRCBot_GUI.Interface' IRCBot_GUI.server_config
