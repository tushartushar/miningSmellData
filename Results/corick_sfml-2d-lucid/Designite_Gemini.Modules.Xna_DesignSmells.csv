Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,ClippingHwndHost,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\ClippingHwndHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,GraphicsDeviceControl,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\GraphicsDeviceControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Imperative Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,HwndMouseEventArgs,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\HwndMouseEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetPosition
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Services,HwndHostInputMapper,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Services\HwndHostInputMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Services,InputMapperBase,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Services\InputMapperBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Services,UIElementInputMapper,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Services\UIElementInputMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Services,UIElementInputMapperBase,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Services\UIElementInputMapperBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Util,NativeMethods,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Util\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Deficient Encapsulation,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,HwndMouseState,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\HwndMouseState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LeftButton' RightButton' MiddleButton' X1Button' X2Button' ScreenPosition
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,DrawEventArgs,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\DrawEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DrawEventArgs' DrawingSurface
Insufficient Modularization,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,GraphicsDeviceControl,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\GraphicsDeviceControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,GraphicsDeviceControl,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\GraphicsDeviceControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 146
Broken Modularization,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Controls,HwndMouseState,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Controls\HwndMouseState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LeftButton' RightButton' MiddleButton' X1Button' X2Button' ScreenPosition
Insufficient Modularization,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Services,InputMapperBase,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Services\InputMapperBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 178
Insufficient Modularization,Gemini.Modules.Xna.Util,NativeMethods,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.Xna\Util\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
