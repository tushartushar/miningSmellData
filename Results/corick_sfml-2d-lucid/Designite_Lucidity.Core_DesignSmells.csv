Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources,ResourceList,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\ResourceList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources,ResourceReferenceExtensions,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\ResourceReferenceExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources,JsonReferenceConverter,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\Serialization\JsonReferenceConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources,JsonReferenceConverter,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\Serialization\JsonReferenceConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Lucidity.Core.Project,LucidityProject,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\LucidityProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Config
Unexloited Encapsulation,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,FolderNode,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\FolderNode.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: FolderNode' ResourceNode (in method "FindByGuid" of class "FolderNode").
Unexloited Encapsulation,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,FolderNode,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\FolderNode.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: FolderNode' ResourceNode (in method "FindByFilePath" of class "FolderNode").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,BaseNode,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\BaseNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseNode' ResourceNode' ResourceTree
Broken Hierarchy,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,FolderNode,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\FolderNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseNode
Cyclic Hierarchy,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,BaseNode,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\BaseNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ResourceTree
Broken Hierarchy,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,ResourceNode,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\ResourceNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseNode
Broken Hierarchy,Lucidity.Core.Project.Resources.TreeModel,ResourceTree,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\LucidityCommon\Project\Resources\TreeModel\ResourceTree.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FolderNode
