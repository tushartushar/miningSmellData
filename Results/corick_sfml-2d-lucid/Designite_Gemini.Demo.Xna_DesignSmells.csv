Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gemini.Demo.Xna,App,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.PrimitiveList,Module,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Modules\PrimitiveList\Module.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.PrimitiveList.Module' Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.SceneViewer.Module' Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.Startup.Module
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.PrimitiveList.ViewModels,PrimitiveWithColor,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Modules\PrimitiveList\ViewModels\PrimitiveListViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Primitive' Color
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.PrimitiveList.Views,PrimitiveListView,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Modules\PrimitiveList\Views\PrimitiveListView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Modules.SceneViewer.Views,SceneView,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Modules\SceneViewer\Views\SceneView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Primitives,VertexPositionNormal,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Primitives\VertexPositionNormal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Normal
Broken Hierarchy,Gemini.Demo.Xna.Primitives,CubePrimitive,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Demo.Xna\Primitives\CubePrimitive.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GeometricPrimitive
