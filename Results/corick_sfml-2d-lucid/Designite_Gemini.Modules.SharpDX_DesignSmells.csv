Duplicate Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.SharpDX.Controls,D3D11ImageSource,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.SharpDX\Controls\D3D11ImageSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: D3D11ImageSource[1' 46]' DeviceService[1' 46]
Imperative Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.SharpDX.Controls,DrawingSurface,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.SharpDX\Controls\DrawingSurface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Invalidate
Duplicate Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.SharpDX.Controls,DrawingSurface,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.SharpDX\Controls\DrawingSurface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DrawingSurface[1' 21]' Disposer[1' 21]
Unutilized Abstraction,Gemini.Modules.SharpDX.Util,Texture2DExtensions,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.SharpDX\Util\Texture2DExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gemini.Modules.SharpDX.Controls,DrawEventArgs,C:\repos\corick_sfml-2d-lucid\gemini-master\src\Gemini.Modules.SharpDX\Controls\DrawEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DrawEventArgs' DrawingSurface
