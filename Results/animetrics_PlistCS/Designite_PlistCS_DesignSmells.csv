Unutilized Abstraction,Testing,plistTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\animetrics_PlistCS\PlistCS\PlistCS\PlistTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,PlistCS,PlistDateConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\animetrics_PlistCS\PlistCS\Src\Plist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: timeDifference
Deficient Encapsulation,PlistCS,PlistDateConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\animetrics_PlistCS\PlistCS\Src\Plist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: timeDifference
Insufficient Modularization,PlistCS,Plist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\animetrics_PlistCS\PlistCS\Src\Plist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PlistCS,Plist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\animetrics_PlistCS\PlistCS\Src\Plist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 123
