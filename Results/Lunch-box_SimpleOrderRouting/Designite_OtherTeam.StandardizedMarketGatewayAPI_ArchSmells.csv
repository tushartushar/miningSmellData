Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Feature Concentration,OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI,OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ApiDealExecutedEventArgs]' [ApiLimitOrder' ApiMarketGateway' ApiMarketOrder' ApiMarketWay' ApiOrder' ApiOrderFailedEventArgs]' [ApiMarketDataUpdateEventArgs]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI.ApiDealExecutedEventArgs' OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI.ApiMarketDataUpdateEventArgs
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.82  All the dependencies among components: from: SimpleOrderRouting.Console' to: OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Console' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Console' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders' from: SimpleOrderRouting' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' from: SimpleOrderRouting' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets' from: SimpleOrderRouting' to: SimpleOrderRouting.SolvingStrategies' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Feeds' from: SimpleOrderRouting.SolvingStrategies' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets' from: SimpleOrderRouting.SolvingStrategies' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' from: SimpleOrderRouting.SolvingStrategies' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders' from: SimpleOrderRouting.SolvingStrategies' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' to: OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Feeds' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.Infra' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.Infra' to: OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests' to: SimpleOrderRouting' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Investors' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests' to: OtherTeam.StandardizedMarketGatewayAPI' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Infra' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests' to: SimpleOrderRouting.SolvingStrategies' from: SimpleOrderRouting.Tests' to: SimpleOrderRouting.Markets.Orders.,SimpleOrderRouting.Infra.CompositionRootHelper' SimpleOrderRouting.Infra.CompositionRootHelper' SimpleOrderRouting.Infra.InvestorInstructionDtoCallBacks' SimpleOrderRouting.Infra.MarketsAdapter' SimpleOrderRouting.Infra.MarketsAdapter' SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.InvestorInstructionTests' SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.InvestorInstructionTests' SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.MarketSweepSolverTests' SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.MarketSweepSolverTests' SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.MarketSweepSolverTests' SimpleOrderRouting.Tests.MarketSweepSolverTests
