Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  JobTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs' [29' 91])' JobTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs' [189' 251])
Feature Envy,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JobCancelJobRequest which is more interested in members of the type: Zencoder
Feature Envy,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JobDeleteJobRequest which is more interested in members of the type: Zencoder
Feature Envy,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JobJobDetailsRequest which is more interested in members of the type: Zencoder
Feature Envy,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JobJobProgressRequest which is more interested in members of the type: Zencoder
Feature Envy,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JobNestedAsyncRequests which is more interested in members of the type: Zencoder
Feature Envy,Zencoder.Test,JobTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\JobTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: JobResubmitJobRequest which is more interested in members of the type: Zencoder
Unutilized Abstraction,Zencoder.Test,NotificationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\NotificationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Zencoder.Test,TestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ChadBurggraf_zencoder-cs\Source\Zencoder.Test\TestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ApiKey' Zencoder
