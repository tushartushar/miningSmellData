Multifaceted Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,PagedSourceProviderMakeSync,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PagedSourceProviderMakeSync.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unnecessary Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,CountChangedEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\INotifyCountChanged.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NeedsReset' Count
Unnecessary Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,INotifyCountChanged,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\INotifyCountChanged.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,IRepeatingVirtualizationAction,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\IRepeatingVirtualizationAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,SourcePagePendingUpdates,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\ISourcePage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Args' UpdatedAt
Unnecessary Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,PageDelta,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PageDelta.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Page' Delta
Unnecessary Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,PagedSourceItemsPacket,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PagedSourceItemsPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Items' LoadedAt' _LoadedAt
Duplicate Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,IAsyncResetProvider,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PaginationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IAsyncResetProvider[235' 254]' VirtualizingObservableCollection[634' 653]
Unutilized Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,IProviderPreReset,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PaginationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,VirtualizingObservableCollection,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\VirtualizingObservableCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.84
Insufficient Modularization,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,PaginationManager,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PaginationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,PaginationManager,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\PaginationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Insufficient Modularization,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,VirtualizingObservableCollection,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\VirtualizingObservableCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,VirtualizingObservableCollection,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\VirtualizingObservableCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,BaseActionVirtualization,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\BaseActionVirtualization.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoAction
Missing Hierarchy,AlphaChiTech.Virtualization,VirtualizingObservableCollection,F:\newReposMay17\anagram4wander_VirtualizingObservableCollection\AlphaChiTech.Virtualization\VirtualizingObservableCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IProviderPreReset' IAsyncResetProvider (in method "ResetAsync" of class "VirtualizingObservableCollection").
