Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kudu.Stress,TestArtifacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\StressTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' appManager' resourceMonitor' testRepository
Feature Envy,Kudu.Stress,StressTestCases,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\StressTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StressGitPushScenario which is more interested in members of the type: GitApplication
Duplicate Abstraction,Kudu.Stress,StressConsoleTraceListener,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\TraceListeners.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StressConsoleTraceListener (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\TraceListeners.cs' [15' 37])' StressConsoleTraceListener (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\TraceListeners.cs' [49' 71])
Deficient Encapsulation,Kudu.Stress,TestArtifacts,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\StressTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: appManager' resourceMonitor' testRepository
Deficient Encapsulation,Kudu.Stress,GitApplication,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\StressTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AppName' FirstCommitID' SecondCommitID' FileToModify' GitUrl' VerificationContent
Deficient Encapsulation,Kudu.Stress,StressTestCases,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\StressTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestApplication
Broken Modularization,Kudu.Stress,GitApplication,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Stress\StressTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AppName' FirstCommitID' SecondCommitID' FileToModify' GitUrl' VerificationContent
