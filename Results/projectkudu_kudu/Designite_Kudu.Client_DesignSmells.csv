Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kudu.Client.Deployment,ZipDeployMetadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Deployment\RemotePushDeploymentManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsAsync' Author' AuthorEmail' Deployer' Message
Unutilized Abstraction,Kudu.Client.Infrastructure,HttpClientExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Infrastructure\HttpClientExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kudu.Client.Infrastructure,IEventProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Infrastructure\IEventProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Kudu.Client,HttpResponseMessageExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Infrastructure\HttpResponseMessageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kudu.Client,HttpExceptionMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Infrastructure\HttpResponseMessageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StatusCode' ReasonPhrase' ExceptionMessage' ExceptionType
Broken Modularization,Kudu.Client.Deployment,ZipDeployMetadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Deployment\RemotePushDeploymentManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsAsync' Author' AuthorEmail' Deployer' Message
Broken Hierarchy,Kudu.Client.Deployment,RemoteDeploymentLegacySettingsManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Settings\RemoteDeploymentLegacySettingsManager.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Kudu.Client.Deployment.RemoteDeploymentSettingsManager
Wide Hierarchy,Kudu.Client.Infrastructure,KuduRemoteClientBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\projectkudu_kudu\Kudu.Client\Infrastructure\KuduRemoteClientBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Kudu.Client.Command.RemoteCommandExecutor' Kudu.Client.Deployment.RemotePushDeploymentManager' Kudu.Client.Deployment.RemoteFetchManager' Kudu.Client.Deployment.RemoteDeploymentManager' Kudu.Client.Deployment.RemoteDeploymentSettingsManager' Kudu.Client.Diagnostics.RemoteRuntimeManager' Kudu.Client.Diagnostics.RemoteLogFilesManager' Kudu.Client.Diagnostics.RemoteProcessManager' Kudu.Client.Diagnostics.RemoteWebHooksManager' Kudu.Client.Editor.RemoteVfsManager' Kudu.Client.Editor.RemoteZipManager' Kudu.Client.RemoteEnvironmentManager' Kudu.Client.Jobs.RemoteJobsManager' Kudu.Client.SiteExtensions.RemoteSiteExtensionManager' Kudu.Client.SourceControl.RemoteRepositoryManager' Kudu.Client.SSHKey.RemoteSSHKeyManager' Kudu.TestHarness.RemoteLogStreamManager
