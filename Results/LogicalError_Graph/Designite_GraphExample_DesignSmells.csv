Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,GraphNodes,ExampleForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LogicalError_Graph\GraphExample\ExampleForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExampleForm which is more interested in members of the type: GraphControl
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphNodes.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LogicalError_Graph\GraphExample\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,GraphNodes,ExampleForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LogicalError_Graph\GraphExample\ExampleForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Node' NodeItem (in method "OnShowElementMenu" of class "ExampleForm").
