Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,SimulatedHttpRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\SimulatedHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.SimulatedHttpRequest' Http.TestLibrary.SimulatedHttpRequest
Multifaceted Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,FakeHttpSessionState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\HttpSimulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Feature Envy,Http.TestLibrary,ConfigMapPath,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\HttpSimulator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MapPath which is more interested in members of the type: HttpSimulator
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpServerUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpServerUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpServerUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpServerUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpSessionState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpSessionState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpSessionState' Http.TestLibrary.HttpSimulator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpServerUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpServerUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpServerUtility' Http.TestLibrary.HttpSimulator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpSessionState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpSessionState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpSessionState' Http.TestLibrary.HttpSimulator' Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpServerUtility
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpContext' Http.TestLibrary.HttpSimulator' Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpServerUtility
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpSessionState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpSessionState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpSessionState' Http.TestLibrary.HttpSimulator' Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpServerUtility' Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.HttpContext
Rebellious Hierarchy,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpSessionState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpSessionState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CopyTo
