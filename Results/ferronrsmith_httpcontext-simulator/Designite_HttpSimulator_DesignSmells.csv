Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpSessionState,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpSessionState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpContext,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,SimulatedHttpRequest,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\SimulatedHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,SimulatedHttpRequest,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\SimulatedHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped.SimulatedHttpRequest' Http.TestLibrary.SimulatedHttpRequest
Multifaceted Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,FakeHttpSessionState,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\HttpSimulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpContext,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpRequest,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpResponse,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpServerUtility,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpServerUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpServerUtility,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpServerUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Http.TestLibrary,IHttpResponse,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\IHttpResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Http.TestLibrary.BaseWrapped,HttpSessionState,C:\repos\ferronrsmith_httpcontext-simulator\HttpSimulator\BaseWrapped\HttpSessionState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CopyTo
