Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Converters,SqliteStringConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\Converters\SqliteStringConverters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxColumnDefinition' MaxVarCharLength
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.OrmLite,SqliteDialect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteDialect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Provider' Instance
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.OrmLite,SqliteDialect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteDialect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteOrmLiteDialectProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Data\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteOrmLiteDialectProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Data\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RowVersionTriggerFormat
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RowVersionTriggerFormat
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite,SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.OrmLite\src\ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite\SqliteOrmLiteDialectProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetQuotedName' GetTableName' GetQuotedTableName' DoesSchemaExist' ToCreateSchemaStatement' SqlConcat' SqlCurrency' SqlBool
