Unutilized Abstraction,ClangSharp,IReadOnlyListExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\Extensions\IReadOnlyListExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddNativeTypeNameAttribute which is more interested in members of the type: OutputBuilder
Feature Envy,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WithAttributes which is more interested in members of the type: OutputBuilder
Feature Envy,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: VisitCompoundStmt which is more interested in members of the type: OutputBuilder
Feature Envy,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: VisitReturnStmt which is more interested in members of the type: OutputBuilder
Unexploited Encapsulation,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BuiltinType' FunctionType (in method "GetTypeName" of class "PInvokeGenerator").
Unexploited Encapsulation,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BuiltinType' IncompleteArrayType (in method "VisitTypedefDeclForUnderlyingType" of class "PInvokeGenerator").
Unexploited Encapsulation,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BuiltinType' TagType (in method "VisitTypedefDeclForPointeeType" of class "PInvokeGenerator").
Insufficient Modularization,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 69 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ClangSharp,PInvokeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_ClangSharp\sources\ClangSharp.PInvokeGenerator\PInvokeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 298
