Unnecessary Abstraction,Kingsland.PiFaceSharp.UnitTests,PiFaceDeviceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikeclayton_PiFaceSharp\src\Kingsland.PiFaceSharp.UnitTests\PiFaceDeviceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Kingsland.PiFaceSharp.UnitTests,PiFaceDeviceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikeclayton_PiFaceSharp\src\Kingsland.PiFaceSharp.UnitTests\PiFaceDeviceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
