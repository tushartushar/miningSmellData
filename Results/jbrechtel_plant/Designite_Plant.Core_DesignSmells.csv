Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Plant.Core,LazyPropertyHasWrongTypeException,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\LazyPropertyHasWrongTypeException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Plant.Core,ILazyProperty,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\LazyProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Func
Unutilized Abstraction,Plant.Core,PropertyNotFoundException,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\PropertyNotFoundException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Plant.Core,ISequence,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\Sequence.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Func
Unutilized Abstraction,Plant.Core,TypeNotSetupException,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\TypeNotSetupException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Plant.Core,BasePlant,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\BasePlant.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Plant.Core,BasePlant,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\BasePlant.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Plant.Core.BasePlant' Plant.Core.IBlueprint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Plant.Core,IBlueprint,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\IBlueprint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Plant.Core.IBlueprint' Plant.Core.BasePlant
Missing Hierarchy,Plant.Core,BasePlant,C:\repos\jbrechtel_plant\Plant.Core\BasePlant.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ILazyProperty' ISequence (in method "SetProperties" of class "BasePlant").
