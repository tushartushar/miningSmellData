Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,FunqControllerFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FunqControllerFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,MvcPageResultExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\MvcPageResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UserSession' AuthSession
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.FluentValidation.Mvc,FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStack.FluentValidation.Mvc,FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider.cs' [1' 20])' ValidationResultExtension (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\ValidationResultExtension.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.FluentValidation.Mvc,ValidationResultExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\ValidationResultExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc.MiniProfiler,MvcMiniProfiler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\MiniProfiler\MvcMiniProfiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc.MiniProfiler,ProfilingActionFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\MiniProfiler\ProfilingActionFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc.MiniProfiler,ProfilingViewEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\MiniProfiler\ProfilingViewEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultAction' CatchAllController
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultAction' CatchAllController
Unexploited Encapsulation,ServiceStack.FluentValidation.Mvc,StringLengthFluentValidationPropertyValidator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\PropertyValidatorAdapters\StringLengthFluentValidationPropertyValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MinimumLengthValidator' MaximumLengthValidator' MinimumLengthValidator (in method "GetClientValidationRules" of class "StringLengthFluentValidationPropertyValidator").
Unexploited Encapsulation,ServiceStack.FluentValidation.Mvc,StringLengthFluentValidationPropertyValidator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\FluentValidation\PropertyValidatorAdapters\StringLengthFluentValidationPropertyValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MinimumLengthValidator' MaximumLengthValidator (in method "GetClientValidationRules" of class "StringLengthFluentValidationPropertyValidator").
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStack.Mvc.ServiceStackController
