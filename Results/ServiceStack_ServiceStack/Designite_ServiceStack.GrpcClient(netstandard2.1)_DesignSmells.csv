Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack,Methods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Get' Post' Put' Delete' Patch
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack,Keywords,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HeaderSessionId' HttpStatus' GrpcResponseStatus
Unexploited Encapsulation,ServiceStack,GrpcServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IGet' IPost' IDelete (in method "GetMethod" of class "GrpcServiceClient").
Unexploited Encapsulation,ServiceStack,GrpcServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IPut' IPatch (in method "GetMethod" of class "GrpcServiceClient").
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack,GrpcMarshaller<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: metaType
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack,GrpcMarshaller<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: metaType
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,GrpcServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 56 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,GrpcServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 68 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,GrpcServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Broken Modularization,ServiceStack,Methods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Get' Post' Put' Delete' Patch
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack,ResponseCallContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.ResponseCallContext' ServiceStack.GrpcServiceClient
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack,GrpcMarshaller<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.GrpcMarshaller<T>' ServiceStack.GrpcUtils
Missing Hierarchy,ServiceStack,GrpcServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.GrpcClient\GrpcServiceClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IVerb' IGet (in method "GetMethod" of class "GrpcServiceClient").
