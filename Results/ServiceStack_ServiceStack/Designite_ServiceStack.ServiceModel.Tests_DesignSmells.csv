Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts,ArrayOfGuidId,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\DataContracts\ArrayOfGuidId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts,ArrayOfStringId,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\DataContracts\ArrayOfStringId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts,Customer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\DataContracts\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' StoreId' FirstName' LastName' Email
Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts,Customer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\DataContracts\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts.Customer' ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.Customer
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts.Operations,GetCustomersResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\DataContracts\Operations\GetCustomersResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests,KeyValueDataContractDeserializerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\KeyValueDataContractDeserializerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests,Customer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\KeyValueDataContractDeserializerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstName' LastName' Age' DOB
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests,Customer2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\KeyValueDataContractDeserializerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstName' LastName' FullName
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests,XlinqExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\XlinqExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests.DataContracts,Customer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\ServiceStack.ServiceModel.Tests\DataContracts\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' StoreId' FirstName' LastName' Email
