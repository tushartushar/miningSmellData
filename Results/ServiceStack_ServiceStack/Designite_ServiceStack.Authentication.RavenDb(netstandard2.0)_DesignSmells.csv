Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb,RavenUserAuth,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb\RavenDbUserAuthRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb,RavenUserAuthDetails,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb\RavenDbUserAuthRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb,RavenDbExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb\RavenDbUserAuthRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb,RavenDbUserAuthRepository<TUserAuth;TUserAuthDetails>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb\RavenDbUserAuthRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Modularization,ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb,Result,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb\RavenDbUserAuthRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UserName' Email' Search' Provider' UserId' UserAuthId' ModifiedDate
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb,RavenDbUserAuthRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb\RavenDbUserAuthRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb.RavenDbUserAuthRepository' ServiceStack.Authentication.RavenDb.RavenDbUserAuthRepository<TUserAuth'TUserAuthDetails>
