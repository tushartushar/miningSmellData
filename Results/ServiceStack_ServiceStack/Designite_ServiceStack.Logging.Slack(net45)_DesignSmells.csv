Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStack.Logging.Slack,SlackLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SlackLog (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLog.cs' [11' 31])' SlackLogFactory (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLogFactory.cs' [15' 35])
Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStack.Logging.Slack,SlackLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SlackLog (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLog.cs' [33' 66])' SlackLogFactory (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLogFactory.cs' [37' 70])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Logging.Slack,SlackLoggingData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Channel' Text' Username' IconEmoji
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Logging.Slack,SlackLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Logging.Slack\SlackLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
