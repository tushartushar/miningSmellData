Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,ServiceStack.Extensions,ServiceStack,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ServiceStack' ServiceStack.Grpc,ServiceStack.TypesProtoService' ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcProtoGenerator,ServiceStack.TypesProtoService' ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcProtoGenerator
Unstable Dependency,ServiceStack.Extensions,ServiceStack.Grpc,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ServiceStack,ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcFeature,ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcFeature
Feature Concentration,ServiceStack.Extensions,ServiceStack,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ServiceCollectionExtensions' GrpcMarshallerFactory]' [GrpcFeature' TypesProto' TypesProtoService' StreamFileService' SubscribeServerEventsService' GrpcServiceBase' IStreamService]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,ServiceStack.ServiceCollectionExtensions' ServiceStack.GrpcMarshallerFactory,ServiceStack.ServiceCollectionExtensions' ServiceStack.GrpcMarshallerFactory' ServiceStack.GrpcFeature' ServiceStack.TypesProto' ServiceStack.TypesProtoService' ServiceStack.StreamFileService' ServiceStack.SubscribeServerEventsService' ServiceStack.GrpcServiceBase' ServiceStack.IStreamService
