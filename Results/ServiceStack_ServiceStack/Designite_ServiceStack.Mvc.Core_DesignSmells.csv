Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,MvcPageResultExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\MvcPageResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RazorFormat (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs' [1083' 1104])' ServiceStackController<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs' [168' 189])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,ViewPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,ResharperViewPage<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UserSession' AuthSession
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: log
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: log
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultAction
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultAction
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorViewExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 108 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorViewExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 116 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorViewExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.Mvc,ExecuteServiceStackFiltersAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ExecuteServiceStackFiltersAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.Mvc.ExecuteServiceStackFiltersAttribute' ServiceStack.Mvc.ServiceStackController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.Mvc.RazorFormat' ServiceStack.Mvc.RazorHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,ServiceStack.Mvc,RazorFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\RazorFormat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: HasView' RenderPartial
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStack.Mvc,ServiceStackController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Mvc\ServiceStackController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStack.Mvc.ServiceStackController
