Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack,ServiceCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\GrpcFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ServiceStack,TypesProto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\GrpcFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack,GrpcFeature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\GrpcFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.GrpcFeature' ServiceStack.GrpcServiceBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.Grpc,GrpcRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\Grpc\GrpcRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcRequest' ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcResponse
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack,GrpcFeature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\GrpcFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.GrpcFeature' ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcProtoGenerator' ServiceStack.TypesProtoService
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack,TypesProtoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\GrpcFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ServiceStack.TypesProtoService' ServiceStack.GrpcFeature' ServiceStack.GrpcServiceBase' ServiceStack.Grpc.GrpcProtoGenerator
Broken Hierarchy,ServiceStack,TypesProtoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.Extensions\GrpcFeature.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStack.Service
