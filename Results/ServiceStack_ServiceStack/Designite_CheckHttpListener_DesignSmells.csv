Unnecessary Abstraction,CheckHttpListener,QueryRockstars,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CheckHttpListener,QueryRockstars,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CheckHttpListener,TestService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,CheckHttpListener,RequestInfoServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\RequestInfoTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CheckHttpListener,RequestInfoTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\RequestInfoTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CheckHttpListener,AppSelfHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SeedRockstars
Deficient Encapsulation,CheckHttpListener,AppSelfHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SeedRockstars
Deficient Encapsulation,CheckHttpListener,RequestInfoTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\RequestInfoTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BaseUrl
Rebellious Hierarchy,CheckHttpListener,AppSelfHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResolvePathInfo
Broken Hierarchy,CheckHttpListener,TestService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStack.Service
Broken Hierarchy,CheckHttpListener,RequestInfoServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\tests\CheckHttpListener\RequestInfoTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ServiceStack.Service
