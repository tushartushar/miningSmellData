Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack,CachedHttpClientExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\CachedHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClientUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack,InternalExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: log' DefaultUserAgent' ContentType
Deficient Encapsulation,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: log' DefaultUserAgent
Unexploited Encapsulation,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IGet' IPost' IDelete (in method "SendAsync" of class "JsonHttpClient").
Unexploited Encapsulation,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IPut' IPatch (in method "SendAsync" of class "JsonHttpClient").
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,CachedHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\CachedHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 78 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,CachedHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\CachedHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 81 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,CachedHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\CachedHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 109
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 114 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 123 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 168
Multipath Hierarchy,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IServiceClient
Missing Hierarchy,ServiceStack,JsonHttpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStack_ServiceStack\src\ServiceStack.HttpClient\JsonHttpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IVerb' IGet (in method "SendAsync" of class "JsonHttpClient").
