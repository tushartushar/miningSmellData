Unnecessary Abstraction,Nancy.Encryption.MachineKey,MachineKeyCryptographyConfigurations,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NancyFx_Nancy\src\Nancy.Encryption.MachineKey\MachineKeyCryptographyConfigurations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' NoEncryption' DefaultConfiguration' NoEncryptionConfiguration
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Encryption.MachineKey,MachineKeyCryptographyConfigurations,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NancyFx_Nancy\src\Nancy.Encryption.MachineKey\MachineKeyCryptographyConfigurations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
