Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Giles.Core,Giles.Core.Runners,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Giles.Core.Runners' Giles.Core.Utility
Unstable Dependency,Giles.Core,Giles.Core.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Giles.Core.UI
Unstable Dependency,Giles.Core,Giles.Core.Runners,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Giles.Core.Configuration' Giles.Core.Utility
Unstable Dependency,Giles.Core,Giles.Core.Watchers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Giles.Core.AppDomains
Feature Concentration,Giles.Core,Giles.Core.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Filter' FilterType' GilesConfig' GilesConfigBuilder' RunnerAssembly]' [MsBuildProject' TestAssemblyFinder]' [Settings]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38
