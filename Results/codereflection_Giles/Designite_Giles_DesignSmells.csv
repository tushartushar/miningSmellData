Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Giles,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ClearTestFilters which is more interested in members of the type: GilesConfig
Feature Envy,Giles,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DisplayConfig which is more interested in members of the type: GilesConfig
Unnecessary Abstraction,Giles,InteractiveMenuOption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HandlesKey' Task
Deficient Encapsulation,Giles.Options,CLOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\Options\CLOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SolutionPath' TestAssemblyPaths
Deficient Encapsulation,Giles,InteractiveMenuOption,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HandlesKey' Task
Deficient Encapsulation,Giles,UserInputHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\UserInputHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Output' Input
Deficient Encapsulation,Giles,UserInputHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\codereflection_Giles\src\Giles\UserInputHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields.
