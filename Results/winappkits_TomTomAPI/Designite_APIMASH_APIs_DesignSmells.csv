Unnecessary Abstraction,APIMASH_TomTom,TomTomViewModel,C:\repos\winappkits_TomTomAPI\WindowsPhone8\APIMASH_APIs\APIMASH_TomTom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResultsTruncated' Results' _cameraListTruncated' _cameras
Unnecessary Abstraction,APIMASH.Mapping,IMappable,C:\repos\winappkits_TomTomAPI\WindowsPhone8\APIMASH_APIs\IMappable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Label' Position
Deficient Encapsulation,APIMASH_TomTom,TomTomApi,C:\repos\winappkits_TomTomAPI\WindowsPhone8\APIMASH_APIs\APIMASH_TomTom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TomTomViewModel
Broken Modularization,APIMASH_TomTom,TomTomCameraViewModel,C:\repos\winappkits_TomTomAPI\WindowsPhone8\APIMASH_APIs\APIMASH_TomTom.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
