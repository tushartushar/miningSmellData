Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xerath,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Imperative Abstraction,Xerath,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialize
Unutilized Abstraction,Xerath,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Xerath,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Broken Modularization,Xerath,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.Config' Xerath.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,SpellManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\SpellManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.SpellManager' Xerath.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.ActiveModes' Xerath.Program' Xerath.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,SpellManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\SpellManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.SpellManager' Xerath.Program' Xerath.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.ActiveModes' Xerath.Program' Xerath.Config' Xerath.ItemManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,Damages,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\Damages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.Damages' Xerath.Program' Xerath.Config' Xerath.SpellManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Xerath,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Xerath\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Xerath.Program' Xerath.Config' Xerath.SpellManager' Xerath.ActiveModes
