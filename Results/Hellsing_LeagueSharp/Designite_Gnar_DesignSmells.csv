Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Gnar,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ActiveModes (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs' [92' 122])' ActiveModes (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs' [250' 280])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gnar,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Unutilized Abstraction,Gnar,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Gnar,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GameObject_OnCreate which is more interested in members of the type: GnarRock
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gnar,GnarRock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Object' NetworkId' RockPos' ExpireTime
Unutilized Abstraction,Gnar,VectorHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\VectorHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Gnar,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TextAxe' TextLittle
Deficient Encapsulation,Gnar,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TextAxe' TextLittle
Broken Modularization,Gnar,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.ActiveModes' Gnar.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.Config' Gnar.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,SpellManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\SpellManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.SpellManager' Gnar.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.ActiveModes' Gnar.Program' Gnar.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.ActiveModes' Gnar.Program' Gnar.Config' Gnar.ItemManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,Damages,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Damages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.Damages' Gnar.Program' Gnar.Config' Gnar.SpellManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gnar,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Gnar\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gnar.Program' Gnar.Config' Gnar.SpellManager' Gnar.ActiveModes
