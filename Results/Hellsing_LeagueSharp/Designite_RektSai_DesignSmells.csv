Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,RektSai,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\RektSai\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Unutilized Abstraction,RektSai,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\RektSai\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,RektSai,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\RektSai\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RektSai,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\RektSai\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RektSai.Config' RektSai.SpellManager
