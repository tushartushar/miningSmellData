Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kalista,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Unutilized Abstraction,Kalista,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Kalista,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Deficient Encapsulation,Kalista,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: wallJumpInitTime' wallJumpTarget' wallJumpPossible' fleeTargetPosition
Deficient Encapsulation,Kalista,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: wallJumpInitTime' wallJumpTarget' wallJumpPossible' fleeTargetPosition
Broken Modularization,Kalista,Mode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMBO' HARASS' WAVE' JUNGLE' FLEE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.Config' Kalista.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,SpellManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\SpellManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.SpellManager' Kalista.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.ActiveModes' Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,Damages,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\Damages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.Damages' Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,SpellManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\SpellManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.SpellManager' Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,ActiveModes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ActiveModes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.ActiveModes' Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config' Kalista.Damages
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,ItemManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\ItemManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.ItemManager' Kalista.ActiveModes' Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config' Kalista.SpellManager' Kalista.ActiveModes
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,SoulBoundSaver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\SoulBoundSaver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Kalista.SoulBoundSaver' Kalista.Program' Kalista.Config' Kalista.SpellManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Kalista,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Hellsing_LeagueSharp\Kalista\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
