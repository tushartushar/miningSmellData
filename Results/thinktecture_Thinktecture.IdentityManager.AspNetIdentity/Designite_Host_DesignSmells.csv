Unutilized Abstraction,IdentityManager.Host,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinktecture_Thinktecture.IdentityManager.AspNetIdentity\source\Host\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,IdentityManager.Host.Config,CustomIdentityManagerServiceWithIntKeysExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinktecture_Thinktecture.IdentityManager.AspNetIdentity\source\Host\Config\CustomIdentityManagerServiceWithIntKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,IdentityManager.Host.Config,SimpleIdentityManagerServiceExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinktecture_Thinktecture.IdentityManager.AspNetIdentity\source\Host\Config\SimpleIdentityManagerService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IdentityManager.Host,UserManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinktecture_Thinktecture.IdentityManager.AspNetIdentity\source\Host\Config\SimpleEntities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IdentityManager.Host.UserManager' IdentityManager.Host.ClaimsFactory
