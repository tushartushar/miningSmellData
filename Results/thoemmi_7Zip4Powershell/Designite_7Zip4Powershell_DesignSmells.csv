Unutilized Abstraction,SevenZip4PowerShell,Get7ZipInformation,C:\repos\thoemmi_7Zip4Powershell\7Zip4Powershell\Get7ZipInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SevenZip4PowerShell,ArchiveInformation,C:\repos\thoemmi_7Zip4Powershell\7Zip4Powershell\Get7ZipInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SevenZip4PowerShell,ParameterSetNames,C:\repos\thoemmi_7Zip4Powershell\7Zip4Powershell\ParameterSetNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NoPassword' PlainPassword' SecurePassword
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SevenZip4PowerShell,Compress7Zip,C:\repos\thoemmi_7Zip4Powershell\7Zip4Powershell\Compress7Zip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SevenZip4PowerShell.Compress7Zip' SevenZip4PowerShell.CompressWorker
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SevenZip4PowerShell,CompressWorker,C:\repos\thoemmi_7Zip4Powershell\7Zip4Powershell\Compress7Zip.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
