Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Fooidity.MassTransitIntegration,ContextConsumerFactory<TConsumer;TContext>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Fooidity\src\Fooidity.MassTransitIntegration\ContextConsumerFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Fooidity.MassTransitIntegration,ContextConsumerFactory<TConsumer;TContext>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Fooidity\src\Fooidity.MassTransitIntegration\ContextConsumerFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateContainerScope which is more interested in members of the type: ICodeSwitchContainerScope
