Unutilized Abstraction,Banzai.Log4Net.Test,SubjectChangingNode1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Log4Net.Test\TestClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Banzai.Log4Net.Test,FaultingTestNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Log4Net.Test\TestClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Banzai.Log4Net.Test,FailingTestNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Log4Net.Test\TestClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Banzai.Log4Net.Test,TestObjectA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Log4Net.Test\TestClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestValueString' TestValueInt
