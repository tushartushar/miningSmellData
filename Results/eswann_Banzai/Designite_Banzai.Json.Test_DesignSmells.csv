Unutilized Abstraction,Banzai.Json.Test,WhenSerializingBasicFlow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Json.Test\WhenSerializingBasicFlow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Banzai.Json.Test,WhenSerializingBasicFlow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Json.Test\WhenSerializingBasicFlow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WhenSerializingBasicFlow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Json.Test\WhenSerializingBasicFlow.cs' [23' 43])' WhenSerializingBasicFlow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Json.Test\WhenSerializingBasicFlow.cs' [49' 69])
Deficient Encapsulation,Banzai.Json.Test,TestObjectASub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eswann_Banzai\test\Banzai.Json.Test\TestClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestValueDecimal
