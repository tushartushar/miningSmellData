Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.Agg,WebCamWidget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\WebCamPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WebCamWidget (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\WebCamPage.cs' [1' 35])' WarpOnY (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\FontHintPage.cs' [1' 35])

Feature Envy,MatterHackers.Agg,WebCamWidget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\WebCamPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WebCamWidget which is more interested in members of the type: AForgeCamera
Feature Envy,MatterHackers.Agg,ListBoxPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\ListBoxPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ListBoxPage which is more interested in members of the type: ListBox
Feature Envy,MatterHackers.Agg,RandomFillWidget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\ScrollableWidgetTestPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RandomFillWidget which is more interested in members of the type: ImageBuffer
Unfactored Hierarchy,MatterHackers.Agg,GridControlPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\GridControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  GridControlPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\GridControl.cs' [10' 56])' LayoutPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\GUITester\Pages\LayoutPage.cs' [15' 61])
