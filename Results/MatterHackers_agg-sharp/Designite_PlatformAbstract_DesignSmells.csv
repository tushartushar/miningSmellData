Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.Agg.PlatformAbstract,ImageIO,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PlatformAbstract\ImageIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ImageIO (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PlatformAbstract\ImageIO.cs' [1' 29])' ImageIOPlugin (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PlatformAbstract\ImageIOPlugin.cs' [1' 29])' OSType (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PlatformAbstract\OsInformation.cs' [1' 29])

Unnecessary Abstraction,MatterHackers.Agg.PlatformAbstract,StaticData,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PlatformAbstract\IStaticData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance

Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.Agg.PlatformAbstract,OsInformationPlugin,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PlatformAbstract\OsInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
