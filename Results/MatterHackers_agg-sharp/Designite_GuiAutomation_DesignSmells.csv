Unnecessary Abstraction,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,GetResults,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' widget' containingSystemWindow
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AggInputMethods,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AggInputMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DrawSimulatedMouse
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,ScreenRectangle,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\SearchRegion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AutomationRunner,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MatchLimit' UpDelaySeconds
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,GetResults,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: widget' containingSystemWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,SearchRegion,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\SearchRegion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.GuiAutomation.SearchRegion' MatterHackers.GuiAutomation.AutomationRunner
Insufficient Modularization,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AutomationRunner,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AutomationRunner,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AutomationRunner,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 110
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AutomationRunner,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AutomationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.GuiAutomation.AutomationRunner' MatterHackers.GuiAutomation.SearchRegion
Rebellious Hierarchy,MatterHackers.GuiAutomation,AggInputMethods,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\GuiAutomation\AggInputMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetCurrentScreen
