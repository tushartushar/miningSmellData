Unutilized Abstraction,TexturedCube.Shaders,Cube,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Veldrid\AggShadersUnused\Shaders\Cube.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TexturedCube.Shaders,VertexInput,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Veldrid\AggShadersUnused\Shaders\Cube.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' TexCoords
