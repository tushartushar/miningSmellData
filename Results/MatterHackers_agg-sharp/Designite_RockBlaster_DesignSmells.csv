Broken Modularization,RockBlaster,BulletStyleSheet,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Bullet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TurnRate' ThrustAcceleration' Friction' DamageOnCollide' NumSecondsToLive
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RockBlaster,Bullet,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Bullet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RockBlaster.Bullet' RockBlaster.Player' RockBlaster.Entity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RockBlaster,Bullet,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Bullet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RockBlaster.Bullet' RockBlaster.Player' RockBlaster.Entity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RockBlaster,Entity,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RockBlaster.Entity' RockBlaster.Player
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RockBlaster,Entity,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RockBlaster.Entity' RockBlaster.Bullet' RockBlaster.Player
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RockBlaster,Player,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RockBlaster.Player' RockBlaster.Entity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RockBlaster,Player,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Player.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Broken Hierarchy,RockBlaster,BulletStyleSheet,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Bullet.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gaming.Game.GameObject
Cyclic Hierarchy,RockBlaster,Entity,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Entity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Player
Broken Hierarchy,RockBlaster,Entity,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Entity.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gaming.Game.GameObject
Broken Hierarchy,RockBlaster,PlayerStyleSheet,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\Player.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gaming.Game.GameObject
Broken Hierarchy,RockBlaster,PlayerSaveInfo,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\RockBlaster\PlayerSaveInfo.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gaming.Game.GameObject
