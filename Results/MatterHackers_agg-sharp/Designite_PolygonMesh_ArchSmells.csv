Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,PolygonMesh,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Processors,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Csg,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Processors.CsgOperations
Feature Concentration,PolygonMesh,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Csg,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CsgNode' CsgPlane' PolyType' CsgPolygon' CsgOperations]' [FaceHelper' IntersectionType' CsgAcceleratedMesh]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Csg.FaceHelper' MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Csg.IntersectionType' MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Csg.CsgAcceleratedMesh
Feature Concentration,PolygonMesh,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Processors,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AmfProcessing' ProgressData' MeshOutputSettings' CsgOption' OutputType' MeshFileIo' StlProcessing]' [RemoveTJunctions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Processors.RemoveTJunctions
Scattered Functionality,PolygonMesh,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Csg,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: MatterHackers.VectorMath' MatterHackers.PolygonMesh,MatterHackers.VectorMath.Vector3' MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Vertex' MatterHackers.PolygonMesh.Mesh' MatterHackers.VectorMath.AxisAlignedBoundingBox
Scattered Functionality,PolygonMesh,MatterHackers.PolygonMesh,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: MatterHackers.Agg' MatterHackers.VectorMath,MatterHackers.Agg.Graphics2D' MatterHackers.VectorMath.Vector2
