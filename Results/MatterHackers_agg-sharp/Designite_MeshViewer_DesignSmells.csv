Feature Envy,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,MeshViewerWidget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MeshViewerWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BeginProgressReporting which is more interested in members of the type: PartProcessingInfo
