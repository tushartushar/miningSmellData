Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,ValueDisplayInfo,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\InteractionVolume.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,ValueDisplayInfo,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\InteractionVolume.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ValueDisplayInfo (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\InteractionVolume.cs' [1' 29])' MouseEvent3DArgs (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MouseEvent3DArgs.cs' [1' 29])' MeshViewerApplication (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MeshViewerApplication.cs' [1' 29])' BedShape (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MeshViewerWidget.cs' [1' 29])

Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,InteractionVolume,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\InteractionVolume.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MouseDownOnControl' TotalTransform
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,MouseEvent3DArgs,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MouseEvent3DArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: info' MouseEvent2D
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,MeshViewerWidget,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MeshViewerWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BedImage' interactionVolumes' SelectedInteractionVolume' partProcessingInfo
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,MeshViewerWidget,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MeshViewerWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: BedImage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,InteractionVolume,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\InteractionVolume.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer.InteractionVolume' MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer.MeshViewerWidget
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer,MeshViewerWidget,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\MeshViewer\MeshViewerWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer.MeshViewerWidget' MatterHackers.MeshVisualizer.InteractionVolume
