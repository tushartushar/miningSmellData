Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VertexStorage' Color
Imperative Abstraction,MatterHackers.Agg,LionParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\LionShape\LionShape.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: parse_lion
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.Agg,LionShape,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\LionShape\LionShape.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.Agg,LionShape,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\LionShape\LionShape.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Shapes' Center
