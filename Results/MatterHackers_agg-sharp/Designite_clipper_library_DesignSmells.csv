Feature Envy,ClipperLib,Clipper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InsertMaxima which is more interested in members of the type: Maxima
Unutilized Abstraction,ClipperLib,IntPointExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\IntPointExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ClipperLib,DoublePoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,ClipperLib,IntPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,ClipperLib,IntRect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
