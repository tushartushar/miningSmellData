Unnecessary Abstraction,ClipperLib,IntersectNode,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Edge1' Edge2' Pt
Unutilized Abstraction,ClipperLib,MyIntersectNodeSort,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClipperLib,LocalMinima,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Y' LeftBound' RightBound' Next

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClipperLib,ClipperException,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ClipperLib,IntPoint,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,ClipperLib,IntRect,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: minX' minY' maxX' maxY
Broken Modularization,ClipperLib,TEdge,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.

Broken Modularization,ClipperLib,OutRec,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Idx' IsHole' IsOpen' FirstLeft' Pts' BottomPt' PolyNode
Insufficient Modularization,ClipperLib,ClipperBase,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
Insufficient Modularization,ClipperLib,Clipper,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 105 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ClipperLib,Clipper,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 371
Broken Hierarchy,ClipperLib,PolyTree,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\clipper_library\clipper.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ClipperLib.PolyNode
