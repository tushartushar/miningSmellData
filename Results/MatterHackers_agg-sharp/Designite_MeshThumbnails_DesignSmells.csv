Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.RayTracer,RenderType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\MeshThumbnails\MeshThumbnails\ThumbnailEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RenderType (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\MeshThumbnails\MeshThumbnails\ThumbnailEngine.cs' [12' 40])' ThumbnailTracer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\MeshThumbnails\MeshThumbnails\ThumbnailTracer.cs' [3' 31])
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.RayTracer,ThumbnailEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\MeshThumbnails\MeshThumbnails\ThumbnailEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MatterHackers.RayTracer,RenderPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\MeshThumbnails\MeshThumbnails\ThumbnailTracer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' position' z' color
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.RayTracer,ThumbnailTracer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\MeshThumbnails\MeshThumbnails\ThumbnailTracer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: destImage
