Unutilized Abstraction,ObjParser,Mtl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PolygonMesh\ObjParser\Mtl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ObjParser,Obj,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PolygonMesh\ObjParser\Obj.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,ObjParser,Mtl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PolygonMesh\ObjParser\Mtl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MaterialList
Deficient Encapsulation,ObjParser,Obj,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PolygonMesh\ObjParser\Obj.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VertexList' FaceList' TextureList
Broken Modularization,ObjParser,Extent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PolygonMesh\ObjParser\Extent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: XMax' XMin' YMax' YMin' ZMax' ZMin' XSize' YSize' ZSize
Rebellious Hierarchy,ObjParser.Types,Material,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\PolygonMesh\ObjParser\Types\Material.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LoadFromStringArray
