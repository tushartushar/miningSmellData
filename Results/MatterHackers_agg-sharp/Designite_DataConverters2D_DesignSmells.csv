Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,CachedTesselator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CachedTesselator (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs' [6' 33])' VertexSourceToClipperPolygons (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\VertexSourceToClipperPolygons.cs' [3' 30])

Feature Envy,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,AddedVertex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddedVertex which is more interested in members of the type: Vector2
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,VertexSourceToClipperPolygons,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\VertexSourceToClipperPolygons.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,VertexSourceToTesselator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\VertexSourceToTesselator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,CachedTesselator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VerticesCache' IndicesCache
Broken Hierarchy,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,VertexTesselatorAbstract,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\VertexSourceToTesselator.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tesselate.Tesselator
