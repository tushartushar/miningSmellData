Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,CachedTesselator,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CachedTesselator (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs' [6' 32])' VertexSourceToClipperPolygons (C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\VertexSourceToClipperPolygons.cs' [3' 29])
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,CachedTesselator,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\CachedTesselator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VerticesCache' IndicesCache
Broken Hierarchy,MatterHackers.DataConverters2D,VertexTesselatorAbstract,C:\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\DataConverters2D\VertexSourceToTesselator.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tesselate.Tesselator
