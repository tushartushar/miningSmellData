Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Gaming.Game,DataAssetCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Game\DataAssetCache.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ModifyOrCreateAsset which is more interested in members of the type: DataAssetTree
Unutilized Abstraction,Gaming.Core,TranslatedString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Core\TranslatedString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gaming.Math,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Math\Helper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Gaming.Audio,AudioSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\AudioSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: s_LoadedSounds' s_LoadedSoundSources
Deficient Encapsulation,Gaming.Audio,AudioSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\AudioSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: s_LoadedSounds' s_LoadedSoundSources
Deficient Encapsulation,Gaming.Audio,Sound,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\Sound.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_BufferHandle' m_Loop
Deficient Encapsulation,Gaming.Audio,SoundSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\SoundSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_SourceHandle
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gaming.Audio,AudioSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\AudioSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gaming.Audio.AudioSystem' Gaming.Audio.SoundSource
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gaming.Audio,Sound,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\Sound.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gaming.Audio.Sound' Gaming.Audio.SoundSource
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Gaming.Audio,AudioSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\AudioSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Gaming.Audio.AudioSystem' Gaming.Audio.SoundSource' Gaming.Audio.Sound
Broken Hierarchy,Gaming.Audio,Sound,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Audio\Sound.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gaming.Game.GameObject
Wide Hierarchy,Gaming.Game,GameObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Game\GameObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: CTFA.Entity' CTFA.PlayerStyleSheet' CTFA.PlayerSaveInfo' CTFA.Playfield' RockBlaster.BulletStyleSheet' RockBlaster.Entity' RockBlaster.PlayerStyleSheet' RockBlaster.PlayerSaveInfo' RockBlaster.Playfield' Gaming.Audio.Sound' Gaming.Game.AssetReference<GameObjectType>' Gaming.Graphics.GameImageSequence
Broken Hierarchy,Gaming.Graphics,GameImageSequence,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\Gaming\Graphics\GameImageSequence.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gaming.Game.GameObject
