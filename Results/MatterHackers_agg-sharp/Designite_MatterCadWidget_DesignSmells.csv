Duplicate Abstraction,MatterHackers.MatterCad,MatterCadWidget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\CameraCalibrationWidget\MatterCadWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MatterCadWidget (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\CameraCalibrationWidget\MatterCadWidget.cs' [1' 30])' PreviewWindowGL (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\CameraCalibrationWidget\PreviewWidnowGL.cs' [1' 30])' CameraData (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\CameraCalibrationWidget\PreviewWindowRayTrace.cs' [1' 30])
Feature Envy,MatterHackers.MatterCad,MatterCadWidget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\CameraCalibrationWidget\MatterCadWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: textSide_Resize which is more interested in members of the type: TextEditWidget
Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.MatterCad,MatterCadWidgetFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MatterHackers_agg-sharp\examples\CameraCalibrationWidget\MatterCadWidget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
