Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong,PongEnvironment,C:\repos\giacomelli_BotWorld\src\DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong\PongEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.84
Broken Modularization,DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong,PongEnvironmentContext,C:\repos\giacomelli_BotWorld\src\DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong\PongEnvironmentContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TableWidth' TableHeight' BallX' BallY' BallSpeedX' BallSpeedY' BallWidth' BallHeight' MyPaddleX' MyPaddleY' OpponentPaddleX' OpponentPaddleY' Cycle
Broken Hierarchy,DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong,Ball,C:\repos\giacomelli_BotWorld\src\DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong\Ball.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PongObject
Broken Hierarchy,DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong,Paddle,C:\repos\giacomelli_BotWorld\src\DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong\Paddle.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PongObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong,PongEnvironment,C:\repos\giacomelli_BotWorld\src\DG.BotWorld.Environments.Games.Pong\PongEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
