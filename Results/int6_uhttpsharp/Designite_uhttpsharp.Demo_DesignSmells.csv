Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers,Question,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Controllers\DemoController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TheQuestion
Unutilized Abstraction,uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers,MyController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Controllers\DemoController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,uhttpsharpdemo,MyModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MyProperty' Model
Unutilized Abstraction,uhttpsharpdemo,SessionHolder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,uhttpsharpdemo,SomeRestController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\SomeRestController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers,BaseController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Controllers\DemoController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers.BaseController' uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers.DerivedController
Cyclic Hierarchy,uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers,BaseController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Controllers\DemoController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DerivedController
Broken Hierarchy,uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers,DerivedController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\int6_uhttpsharp\uhttpsharp-demo\Controllers\DemoController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): uhttpsharpdemo.Controllers.BaseController
