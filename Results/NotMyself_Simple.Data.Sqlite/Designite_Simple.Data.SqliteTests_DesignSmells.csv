Unutilized Abstraction,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,FindTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\FindTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,Employee,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\FindTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EmployeeID' EmployeeId' FirstName' LastName' BirthDate
Unutilized Abstraction,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,InMemoryUsageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\InMemoryUsageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unutilized Abstraction,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,SchemaProviderTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\SchemaProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,SchemaProviderTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\SchemaProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestPrimaryKeys which is more interested in members of the type: SqliteSchemaProvider
Feature Envy,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,SchemaProviderTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\SchemaProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestIdentityColumn which is more interested in members of the type: SqliteSchemaProvider
Feature Envy,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,SchemaProviderTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\SchemaProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestNotIdentityColumn which is more interested in members of the type: SqliteSchemaProvider
Feature Envy,Simple.Data.SqliteTests,SchemaProviderTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NotMyself_Simple.Data.Sqlite\src\Simple.Data.SqliteTests\SchemaProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestForeignKeys which is more interested in members of the type: SqliteSchemaProvider
