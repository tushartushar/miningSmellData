Deficient Encapsulation,OpenTK,MSG,C:\repos\thefiddler_opentk\Source\GLControl\WinGLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HWnd' Message' WParam' LParam' Time' Point
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenTK,POINT,C:\repos\thefiddler_opentk\Source\GLControl\WinGLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenTK,XVisualInfo,C:\repos\thefiddler_opentk\Source\GLControl\X11GLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
