Unutilized Abstraction,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dapper,KeyAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dapper,NotMappedAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dapper,RequiredAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 135
