Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,C:\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,C:\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dapper,SimpleCRUD,C:\repos\ericdc1_Dapper.SimpleCRUD\Dapper.SimpleCRUD\SimpleCRUD.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 162
