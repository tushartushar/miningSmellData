Unnecessary Abstraction,nQuant,Lookup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Lookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Alpha' Red' Green' Blue
Duplicate Abstraction,nQuant,WuQuantizerBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\WuQuantizerBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WuQuantizerBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\WuQuantizerBase.cs' [459' 478])' WuQuantizerBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\WuQuantizerBase.cs' [480' 499])
Deficient Encapsulation,nQuant,Box,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Box.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AlphaMinimum' AlphaMaximum' RedMinimum' RedMaximum' GreenMinimum' GreenMaximum' BlueMinimum' BlueMaximum' Size
Deficient Encapsulation,nQuant,Lookup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Lookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Alpha' Red' Green' Blue
Deficient Encapsulation,nQuant,Pixel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Pixel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
