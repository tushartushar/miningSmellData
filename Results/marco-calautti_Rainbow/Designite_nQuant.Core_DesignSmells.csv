Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,nQuant,IWuQuantizer,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\IWuQuantizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,nQuant,Lookup,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Lookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Alpha' Red' Green' Blue
Unutilized Abstraction,nQuant,QuantizationException,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\QuantizationException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,nQuant,WuQuantizerBase,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\WuQuantizerBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WuQuantizerBase (C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\WuQuantizerBase.cs' [459' 478])' WuQuantizerBase (C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\WuQuantizerBase.cs' [480' 499])
Deficient Encapsulation,nQuant,Box,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Box.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.

Deficient Encapsulation,nQuant,Lookup,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Lookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Alpha' Red' Green' Blue
Deficient Encapsulation,nQuant,Pixel,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Pixel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Alpha' Red' Green' Blue' Argb
Broken Modularization,nQuant,Box,C:\repos\marco-calautti_Rainbow\nQuant.Core\nQuant\Box.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
