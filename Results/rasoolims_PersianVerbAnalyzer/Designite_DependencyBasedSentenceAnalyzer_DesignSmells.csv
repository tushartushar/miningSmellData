Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,MorphoSyntacticFeatures,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\MorphoSyntacticFeatures.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Clone
Unutilized Abstraction,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [346' 366])' SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [738' 758])
Duplicate Abstraction,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [597' 639])' SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [656' 698])
Duplicate Abstraction,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [878' 917])' SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [1068' 1107])
Duplicate Abstraction,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [939' 958])' SentenceAnalyzer (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs' [1118' 1137])
Insufficient Modularization,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 199
Missing Hierarchy,DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer,SentenceAnalyzer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rasoolims_PersianVerbAnalyzer\DependencyBasedSentenceAnalyzer\SentenceAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: VerbInflection' MostamarSaz (in method "MakePartialDependencyTree" of class "SentenceAnalyzer").
