Unutilized Abstraction,Beerendonk.Transit.Java.Tests,ConvertTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nforza_transit-csharp\src\Transit.Tests\Java\ConvertTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Insufficient Modularization,Beerendonk.Transit.Tests,TransitTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nforza_transit-csharp\src\Transit.Tests\TransitTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 80 public methods
