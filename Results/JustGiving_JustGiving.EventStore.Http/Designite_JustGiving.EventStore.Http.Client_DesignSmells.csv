Unnecessary Abstraction,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,Link,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\BasicEventInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Uri' Relation
Unnecessary Abstraction,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,EventInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\EventInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Content

Broken Modularization,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,BasicEventInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\BasicEventInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Title' EventType' Updated' SequenceNumber' PositionEventNumber' Links' CanonicalEventLink
Insufficient Modularization,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,EventStoreHttpConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\EventStoreHttpConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,ConnectionSettingsBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\ConnectionSettingsBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client.ConnectionSettingsBuilder' JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client.ConnectionSettings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,EventStoreHttpConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\EventStoreHttpConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client.EventStoreHttpConnection' JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client.ConnectionSettings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client,ConnectionSettingsBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JustGiving_JustGiving.EventStore.Http\src\JustGiving.EventStore.Http.Client\ConnectionSettingsBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
