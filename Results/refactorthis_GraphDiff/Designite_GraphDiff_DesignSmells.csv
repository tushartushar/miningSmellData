Unnecessary Abstraction,RefactorThis.GraphDiff,GraphDiffConfiguration,C:\repos\refactorthis_GraphDiff\GraphDiff\GraphDiff\GraphDiffConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ReloadAssociatedEntitiesWhenAttached
