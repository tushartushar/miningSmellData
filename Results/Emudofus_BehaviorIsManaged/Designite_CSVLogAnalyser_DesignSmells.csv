Unutilized Abstraction,CSVLogAnalyser,MainForm,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CSVLogAnalyser.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CSVLogAnalyser,MainForm,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MessageCount' Main' ListMessages
Deficient Encapsulation,CSVLogAnalyser,MainForm,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MessageCount' Main' ListMessages
Deficient Encapsulation,CSVLogAnalyser,TreeMasterMessageItem,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Tree
Deficient Encapsulation,CSVLogAnalyser,TreeMessageItem,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TimeStamp' MessageName' ImageId' ItemLines
Deficient Encapsulation,CSVLogAnalyser,TreeItemLine,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ChildLevel' Variable' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,CSVLogAnalyser,position,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tmmi' tmi' til
Insufficient Modularization,CSVLogAnalyser,MainForm,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Missing Hierarchy,CSVLogAnalyser,position,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\CSVLogAnalyser\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TreeMasterMessageItem' TreeMessageItem (in method "position" of class "position").
