Deficient Encapsulation,BiM.MITM,MITM,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServerConnectionTimeout
Deficient Encapsulation,BiM.MITM,MITM,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ServerConnectionTimeout
Broken Modularization,BiM.MITM,MITMConfiguration,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITMConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FakeAuthHost' FakeAuthPort' FakeWorldHost' FakeWorldPort' RealAuthHost' RealAuthPort
Missing Hierarchy,BiM.MITM,MITM,C:\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ConnectionMITM' AuthenticationTicketMessage (in method "OnWorldClientMessageReceived" of class "MITM").
