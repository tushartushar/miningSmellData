Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,BiM.MITM,MITM,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,BiM.MITM,MITM,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MITM which is more interested in members of the type: MITMConfiguration
Deficient Encapsulation,BiM.MITM,MITM,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServerConnectionTimeout
Deficient Encapsulation,BiM.MITM,MITM,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ServerConnectionTimeout
Broken Modularization,BiM.MITM,MITMConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITMConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FakeAuthHost' FakeAuthPort' FakeWorldHost' FakeWorldPort' RealAuthHost' RealAuthPort
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BiM.MITM.Network,ConnectionMITM,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\Network\ConnectionMITM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BiM.MITM.Network.ConnectionMITM' BiM.MITM.Network.BotMITM
Missing Hierarchy,BiM.MITM,MITM,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Emudofus_BehaviorIsManaged\MITM\MITM.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ConnectionMITM' AuthenticationTicketMessage (in method "OnWorldClientMessageReceived" of class "MITM").
