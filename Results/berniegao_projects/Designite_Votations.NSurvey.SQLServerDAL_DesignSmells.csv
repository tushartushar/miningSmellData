Unnecessary Abstraction,Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL,DbConnection,C:\repos\berniegao_projects\Source_Survey_2.2_Final\Reflector\Nsurvey_SQLServerDAL\Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL\DbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: db' NewDbConnectionString' factory
Unutilized Abstraction,Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL,SurveyAsset,C:\repos\berniegao_projects\Source_Survey_2.2_Final\Reflector\Nsurvey_SQLServerDAL\Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL\SurveyAsset.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL,SurveyAsset,C:\repos\berniegao_projects\Source_Survey_2.2_Final\Reflector\Nsurvey_SQLServerDAL\Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL\SurveyAsset.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SurveyAsset[1' 20]' SurveyLayout[1' 20]
Insufficient Modularization,Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL,Answer,C:\repos\berniegao_projects\Source_Survey_2.2_Final\Reflector\Nsurvey_SQLServerDAL\Votations.NSurvey.SQLServerDAL\Answer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
