Duplicate Abstraction,Kaazing.K3po.NUnit,BarrierStateListener,C:\repos\kaazing_robot.cs\WindowsPhone\K3po.WindowsPhone\..\..\K3po.NUnit\src\BarrierStateListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BarrierStateListener[1' 21]' BarrierState[1' 21]' K3poRule[1' 21]' ScriptRunner[1' 21]

Unnecessary Abstraction,Kaazing.K3po.NUnit,ScriptPair,C:\repos\kaazing_robot.cs\WindowsPhone\K3po.WindowsPhone\..\..\K3po.NUnit\src\ScriptPair.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ObservedScript' ExpectedScript' _observedScript' _expectedScript
Unutilized Abstraction,Kaazing.K3po.NUnit,K3poRule,C:\repos\kaazing_robot.cs\WindowsPhone\K3po.WindowsPhone\src\K3poRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
