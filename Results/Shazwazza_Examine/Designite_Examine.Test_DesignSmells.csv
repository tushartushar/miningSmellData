Unutilized Abstraction,Examine.Test,OrderedDictionaryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\OrderedDictionaryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Examine.Test,IndexInitializer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\IndexInitializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: IndexingError
Unnecessary Abstraction,Examine.Test,TestHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\TestHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AssemblyDirectory
Unutilized Abstraction,Examine.Test.Search,FluentApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Examine.Test.Search,FluentApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FluentApiTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs' [615' 641])' FluentApiTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs' [698' 724])
Duplicate Abstraction,Examine.Test.Search,FluentApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FluentApiTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs' [1508' 1534])' FluentApiTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs' [1550' 1576])
Unutilized Abstraction,Examine.Test.Search,MultiIndexSearch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\MultiIndexSearch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Examine.Test.Search,StringTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\StringTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Examine.Test.Index,LuceneIndexTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Index\LuceneIndexTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Examine.Test.Index,LuceneIndexTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Index\LuceneIndexTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  LuceneIndexTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Index\LuceneIndexTests.cs' [379' 399])' LuceneIndexTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Index\LuceneIndexTests.cs' [595' 615])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Examine.Test.UmbracoExamine,IndexTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\UmbracoExamine\IndexTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Content' Media' Member
Insufficient Modularization,Examine.Test.Search,FluentApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Examine.Test.Search,FluentApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\Search\FluentApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Broken Hierarchy,Examine.Test,TestIndex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shazwazza_Examine\src\Examine.Test\TestIndex.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Examine.LuceneEngine.Providers.LuceneIndex
