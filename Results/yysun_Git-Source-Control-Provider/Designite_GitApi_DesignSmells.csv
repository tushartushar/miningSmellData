Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc.DataServices,Change,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\DataServices\Change.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ChangeType' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc.DataServices,GraphLink,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\DataServices\GraphLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' X1' Y1' X2' Y2
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc.DataServices,GraphNode,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\DataServices\GraphNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Refs' X' Y
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc,GitBashResult,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\GitBashResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HasError' Error' Output
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc,GitCommitResult,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\GitCommitResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsSha1' Message
Deficient Encapsulation,GitScc,GitFile,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\GitFileStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: isSelected
Broken Modularization,GitScc.DataServices,GraphLink,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\DataServices\GraphLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' X1' Y1' X2' Y2
Insufficient Modularization,GitScc,GitFileStatusTracker,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\GitFileStatusTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitScc,GitFileStatusTracker,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\GitFileStatusTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitScc,GitFileStatusTracker,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\GitFileStatusTracker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Broken Hierarchy,GitScc.DataServices,GraphNode,C:\repos\yysun_Git-Source-Control-Provider\GitApi\DataServices\GraphNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GitScc.DataServices.Commit
