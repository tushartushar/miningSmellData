Imperative Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2,Blake2B_Implementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2\Blake2B_ComputeRounds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateBlockTransformer
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2,BlockTransformer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2\Blake2B_Implementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2,IBlake2B,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2\IBlake2B.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Config
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2,Blake2BConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.Blake2\Blake2BConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone
