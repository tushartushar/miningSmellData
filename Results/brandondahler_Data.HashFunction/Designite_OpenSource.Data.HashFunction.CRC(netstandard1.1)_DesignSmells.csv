Imperative Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC,CRCConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC\CRCConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Clone
Imperative Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC,CRC_Implementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC\CRC_Implementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateBlockTransformer
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC,ICRC,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC\ICRC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Config
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC,CRCConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.CRC\CRCConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone
