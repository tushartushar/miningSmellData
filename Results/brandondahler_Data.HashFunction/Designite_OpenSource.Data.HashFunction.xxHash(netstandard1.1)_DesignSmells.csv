Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash,IxxHash,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\IxxHash.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Config
Imperative Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash,xxHash_Implementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\xxHash_Implementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateBlockTransformer
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash,xxHash_Implementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\xxHash_Implementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  xxHash_Implementation (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\xxHash_Implementation.cs' [96' 121])' xxHash_Implementation (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\xxHash_Implementation.cs' [257' 282])
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash,xxHashConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\xxHashConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash,xxHashFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\brandondahler_Data.HashFunction\src\OpenSource.Data.HashFunction.xxHash\xxHashFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
