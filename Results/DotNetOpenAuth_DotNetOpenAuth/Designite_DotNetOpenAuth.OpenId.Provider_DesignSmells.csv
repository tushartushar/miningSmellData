(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider,AuthenticationRequest,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider\OpenId\Provider\AuthenticationRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetClaimedIdentifierFragment
Imperative Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider,HostProcessedRequest,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider\OpenId\Provider\HostProcessedRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: IsReturnUrlDiscoverableAsync
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider,IAnonymousRequest,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider\OpenId\Provider\IAnonymousRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsApproved
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider.Behaviors,AXFetchAsSregTransform,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider\OpenId\Provider\Behaviors\AXFetchAsSregTransform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ApplySecuritySettings
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider.Behaviors,PpidGeneration,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.Provider\OpenId\Provider\Behaviors\PpidGeneration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
