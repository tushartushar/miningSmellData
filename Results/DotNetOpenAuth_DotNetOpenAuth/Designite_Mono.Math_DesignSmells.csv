Duplicate Abstraction,Mono.Math,BigInteger,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\Mono.Math\BigInteger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BigInteger[1059' 1133]' BigInteger[1157' 1231]
