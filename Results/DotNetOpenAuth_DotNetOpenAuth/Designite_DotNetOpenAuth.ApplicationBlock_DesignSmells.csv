Broken Modularization,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,IOAuth2Graph,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\samples\DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock\OAuth2\IOAuth2Graph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Link' Name' FirstName' LastName' Gender' Locale' BirthdayDT' Email' AvatarUrl' UpdatedTime' GenderEnum
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,AzureADClient,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\samples\DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock\azureadclient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WebServerClient
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,FacebookClient,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\samples\DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock\OAuth2\Facebook\FacebookClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): WebServerClient
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,GoogleConsumer,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\samples\DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock\OAuth1\GoogleConsumer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Consumer
