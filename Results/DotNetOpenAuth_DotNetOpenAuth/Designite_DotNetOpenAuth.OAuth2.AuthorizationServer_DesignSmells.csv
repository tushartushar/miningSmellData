Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,IOAuth2ChannelWithAuthorizationServer,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\ChannelElements\IOAuth2ChannelWithAuthorizationServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AuthorizationServer' ScopeSatisfiedCheck
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,IAuthorizationCodeCarryingRequest,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\Messages\IAuthorizationCodeCarryingRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Code' AuthorizationDescription
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthServer.ChannelElements,IRefreshTokenCarryingRequest,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\Messages\IRefreshTokenCarryingRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RefreshToken' AuthorizationDescription
Unfactored Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,TokenCodeSerializationBindingElement,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\ChannelElements\TokenCodeSerializationBindingElement.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  TokenCodeSerializationBindingElement (C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\ChannelElements\TokenCodeSerializationBindingElement.cs' [31' 51])' MessageValidationBindingElement (C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\ChannelElements\MessageValidationBindingElement.cs' [48' 68])
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,AuthServerBindingElementBase,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\ChannelElements\AuthServerBindingElementBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ProcessOutgoingMessageAsync' ProcessIncomingMessageAsync
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,OAuth2AuthorizationServerChannel,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.AuthorizationServer\OAuth2\ChannelElements\OAuth2AuthorizationServerChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReadFromResponseCoreAsync
