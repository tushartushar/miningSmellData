Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,OAuthAuthorizationServer,OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code' OAuthAuthorizationServer,OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code.Client' OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code.DatabaseKeyNonceStore' OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code.OAuth2AuthorizationServer' OAuthAuthorizationServer.MvcApplication
Unstable Dependency,OAuthAuthorizationServer,OAuthAuthorizationServer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code,OAuthAuthorizationServer.DataClassesDataContext
Feature Concentration,OAuthAuthorizationServer,OAuthAuthorizationServer.Code,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
