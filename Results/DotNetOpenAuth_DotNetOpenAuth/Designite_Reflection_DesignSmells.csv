Unexploited Encapsulation,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools.Reflection,OrcasNamer,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\Reflection\OrcasNamer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TypeNode' Method (in method "WriteType" of class "OrcasNamer").
