Imperative Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth,Protocol,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\Protocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Lookup
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.Messages,ITokenSecretContainingMessage,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\Messages\ITokenSecretContainingMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TokenSecret
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.Messages,ITokenContainingMessage,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\Messages\ITokenContainingMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Token
Broken Modularization,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.ChannelElements,ITamperResistantOAuthMessage,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\ChannelElements\ITamperResistantOAuthMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SignatureMethod' TokenSecret' ConsumerKey' ConsumerSecret' HttpMethod' Recipient
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.ChannelElements,SigningBindingElementBase,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\ChannelElements\SigningBindingElementBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.ChannelElements,RsaSha1SigningBindingElement,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\ChannelElements\RsaSha1SigningBindingElement.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SigningBindingElementBase
Multipath Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.Messages,SignedMessageBase,F:\newReposMay17\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth\OAuth\Messages\SignedMessageBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IExpiringProtocolMessage
