Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2' DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth' System.Compiler
Feature Concentration,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AzureADClaims' AzureADClient' AzureADHeader]' [AzureADGraph]' [FacebookClient' FacebookGraph' HumanGender' IOAuth2Graph' WindowsLiveGraph' GoogleClient' GoogleGraph' WindowsLiveClient]' [HttpAsyncHandlerBase]' [InMemoryClientAuthorizationTracker]' [GoogleConsumer' Util]' [TwitterConsumer]' [YammerConsumer]' [YubikeyResult' YubikeyRelyingParty]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.45
