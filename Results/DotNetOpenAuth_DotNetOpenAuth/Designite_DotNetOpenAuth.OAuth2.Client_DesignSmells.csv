Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.Configuration,OAuth2ClientSection,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\Configuration\OAuth2ClientSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,IOAuth2ChannelWithClient,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\ChannelElements\IOAuth2ChannelWithClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ClientIdentifier' ClientCredentialApplicator' JsonReaderQuotas
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,IOAuth2ChannelWithClient,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\ChannelElements\IOAuth2ChannelWithClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,BearerTokenHttpMessageHandler,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\BearerTokenHttpMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.BearerTokenHttpMessageHandler' DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ClientBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,ClientBase,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\ClientBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ClientBase' DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.BearerTokenHttpMessageHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,AuthorizationState,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\AuthorizationState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SaveChanges
Cyclic Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,ClientCredentialApplicator,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\ClientCredentialApplicator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: NetworkCredentialApplicator
Cyclic Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,ClientCredentialApplicator,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\ClientCredentialApplicator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PostParameterApplicator
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,UserAgentClient,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\UserAgentClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ClientBase
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2,WebServerClient,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\WebServerClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ClientBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.ChannelElements,OAuth2ClientChannel,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\src\DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.Client\OAuth2\ChannelElements\OAuth2ClientChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PrepareDirectResponse
