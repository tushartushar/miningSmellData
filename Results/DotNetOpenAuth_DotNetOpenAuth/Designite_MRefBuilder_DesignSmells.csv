Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools,MRefBuilder,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MRefBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools,MRefBuilder,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MRefBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MRefBuilder (C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MRefBuilder.cs' [118' 145])' MRefBuilder (C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MRefBuilder.cs' [163' 190])
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools.DxCoach,ResourceHelper,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\ResourceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools,MemberDictionary,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MemberDictionary.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TypeNode' EnumNode' TypeNode (in method "MemberDictionary" of class "MemberDictionary").
Unexploited Encapsulation,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools,XamlAttachedMembersAddIn,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\XamlAttachedMembersAddIn.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Property' Event (in method "WriteAttachedMember" of class "XamlAttachedMembersAddIn").
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools,ManagedReflectionWriter,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MRefWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 67 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Ddue.Tools,ManagedReflectionWriter,C:\repos\DotNetOpenAuth_DotNetOpenAuth\tools\Sandcastle\Source\MRefBuilder\MRefWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 192
