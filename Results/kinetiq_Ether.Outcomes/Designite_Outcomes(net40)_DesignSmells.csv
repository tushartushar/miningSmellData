Unnecessary Abstraction,Ether.Outcomes,DeserializableOutcome<TValue>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kinetiq_Ether.Outcomes\Outcomes\DeserializableOutcome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Unutilized Abstraction,Ether.Outcomes,Outcomes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kinetiq_Ether.Outcomes\Outcomes\Outcomes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multipath Hierarchy,Ether.Outcomes,DeserializableOutcome<TValue>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kinetiq_Ether.Outcomes\Outcomes\DeserializableOutcome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IOutcome
Broken Hierarchy,Ether.Outcomes,DeserializableOutcome<TValue>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kinetiq_Ether.Outcomes\Outcomes\DeserializableOutcome.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ether.Outcomes.DeserializableOutcome' Ether.Outcomes.IOutcome
