Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,ConnectionStringsExtendedTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\ConnectionStringsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,ConnectionStringsExtendedTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\ConnectionStringsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConnectionStrings_Are_Enumerable which is more interested in members of the type: ConnectionStringsExtended
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,AppSettingsExtendedTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,AppSettingsToType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Stringg' stringg' doublee' SubDto
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,AppSettingsToTypeInner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PropertyName' Deeper
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,AppSettingsToTypeInner2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PropertyName
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,ClassWithInnerTypeThatCantBeActivated,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Inner
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,UserType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,ConfigurationManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\ConfigurationManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit.Interceptors,ConfigurationSubstitutionInterceptorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\Interceptors\ConfigurationSubstitutionInterceptorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,AppSettingsExtendedTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 49 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit,AppSettingsExtendedTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions.Test.Unit\AppSettingsExtendedTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
