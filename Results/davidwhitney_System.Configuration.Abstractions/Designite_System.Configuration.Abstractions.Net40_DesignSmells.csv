Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions,ConfigurationManager,C:\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\ConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions,IConfigurationManager,C:\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\IConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions,IConfigurationManagerExtended,C:\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\IConfigurationManagerExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions,IInterceptor,C:\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\IInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,System.Configuration.Abstractions,AppSettingsExtended,C:\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\AppSettingsExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Configuration.Abstractions,IConfigurationManager,C:\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\IConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetSection
