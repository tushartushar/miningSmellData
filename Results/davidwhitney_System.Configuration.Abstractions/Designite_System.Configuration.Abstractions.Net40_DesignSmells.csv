Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Configuration.Abstractions,IInterceptor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\IInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,System.Configuration.Abstractions,AppSettingsExtended,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\AppSettingsExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Configuration.Abstractions,AppSettingsExtended,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\AppSettingsExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Add' Clear' CopyTo' HasKeys' Add' Get' GetValues' Set' Remove' Get' GetValues' GetKey' GetObjectData' OnDeserialization' GetEnumerator
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Configuration.Abstractions,ConnectionStringsExtended,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\ConnectionStringsExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: IndexOf' Add' Remove' RemoveAt' Remove' Clear
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Configuration.Abstractions,IConfigurationManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davidwhitney_System.Configuration.Abstractions\System.Configuration.Abstractions\IConfigurationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetSection
