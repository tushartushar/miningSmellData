Unutilized Abstraction,AppHarbor.Test,MockedApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\MockedApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AppHarbor.Test,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,AppHarbor.Test,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: EnsureApplication which is more interested in members of the type: AppHarborClient
Feature Envy,AppHarbor.Test,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Create_Get_Edit_Delete_Application which is more interested in members of the type: AppHarborClient

The method causing this smell is: Create_Get_Edit_Delete_ConfigurationVariable which is more interested in members of the type: AppHarborClient
Feature Envy,AppHarbor.Test,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestCleanupAttribute which is more interested in members of the type: AppHarborClient
Insufficient Modularization,AppHarbor.Test,MockedApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\MockedApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 60 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AppHarbor.Test,MockedApiTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\MockedApiTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
Broken Hierarchy,AppHarbor.Test,MockedAppHarborClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\appharbor_AppHarbor.NET\AppHarbor.Test\MockedApiTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AppHarbor.AppHarborClient
