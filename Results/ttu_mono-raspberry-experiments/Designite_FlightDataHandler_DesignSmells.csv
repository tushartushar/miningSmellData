Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,FlightDataHandler,DataHandler,C:\repos\ttu_mono-raspberry-experiments\src\NancySelfHost\FlightDataHandler\DataHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83
Unnecessary Abstraction,FlightDataHandler,GeoLoc,C:\repos\ttu_mono-raspberry-experiments\src\NancySelfHost\FlightDataHandler\MathHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Point' Radius
Unnecessary Abstraction,FlightDataHandler,Point3D,C:\repos\ttu_mono-raspberry-experiments\src\NancySelfHost\FlightDataHandler\MathHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: X' Y' Z
Unutilized Abstraction,FlightDataHandler.Models,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\ttu_mono-raspberry-experiments\src\NancySelfHost\FlightDataHandler\Models\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,FlightDataHandler.Models,FlightInfo,C:\repos\ttu_mono-raspberry-experiments\src\NancySelfHost\FlightDataHandler\Models\FlightInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Latitude' Longitude' AltitudeFt' Track' SpeedKts' Squawk' Radar' Registration' Unk' Source' Destination' Model' Number' X' Y' Num' DistanceToUserInKm' AltitudeM' SpeedKmh
Broken Modularization,FlightDataHandler.Models,FlightInfoDTO,C:\repos\ttu_mono-raspberry-experiments\src\NancySelfHost\FlightDataHandler\Models\FlightInfoDTO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Latitude' Longitude' AltitudeM' SpeedKmh' Registration' Source' Destination' Model' DistanceToUserKm
