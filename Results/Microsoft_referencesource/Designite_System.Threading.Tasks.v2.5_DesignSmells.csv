Imperative Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,AsyncMethodBuilderCore,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\AsyncMethodBuilderCore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetStateMachine
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,AsyncMethodTaskCache<TResult>,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\AsyncMethodTaskCacheOfTResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,AsyncMethodBooleanTaskCache,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\AsyncMethodTaskCacheOfTResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,AsyncMethodInt32TaskCache,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\AsyncMethodTaskCacheOfTResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,AsyncTaskMethodBuilder,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\AsyncTaskMethodBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,ICriticalNotifyCompletion,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\ICriticalNotifyCompletion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,INotifyCompletion,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\INotifyCompletion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,VoidTaskResult,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\VoidTaskResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,VoidTaskResult,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\VoidTaskResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,System,LightupServices,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Lightup\Lightup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NotFound
Deficient Encapsulation,System,LightupServices,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Lightup\Lightup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NotFound
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,AsyncVoidMethodBuilder,C:\repos\Microsoft_referencesource\Microsoft.Bcl\System.Threading.Tasks.v1.5\System\Runtime\CompilerServices\AsyncVoidMethodBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PreBoxInitialization
