Duplicate Abstraction,MailChimp.Tests,ListTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ListTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs' [377' 397])' ListTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs' [407' 427])
Unnecessary Abstraction,MailChimp.Tests,MyMergeVar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstName' LastName

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MailChimp.Tests,TestGlobal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\TestGlobal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Test_APIKey
Deficient Encapsulation,MailChimp.Tests,TestGlobal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\TestGlobal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Test_APIKey
Insufficient Modularization,MailChimp.Tests,ListTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MailChimp.Tests,ListTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Hierarchy,MailChimp.Tests,MyMergeVar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danesparza_MailChimp.NET\MailChimp.Tests\ListTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MailChimp.Lists.MergeVar
