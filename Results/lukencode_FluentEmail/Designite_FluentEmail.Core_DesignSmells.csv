Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,FluentEmailServiceCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\FluentEmailServiceCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentEmail.Core.Models,Attachment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Models\Attachment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsInline' Filename' Data' ContentType' ContentId
Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentEmail.Core.Models,SendResponse<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Models\SendResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data
Deficient Encapsulation,FluentEmail.Core,Email,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Email.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultRenderer' DefaultSender
Deficient Encapsulation,FluentEmail.Core,Email,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Email.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultRenderer' DefaultSender
Insufficient Modularization,FluentEmail.Core,Email,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Email.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentEmail.Core,Email,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Email.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentEmail.Core,IFluentEmail,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\IFluentEmail.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Modularization,FluentEmail.Core.Models,Attachment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\Models\Attachment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsInline' Filename' Data' ContentType' ContentId
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FluentEmail.Core,IFluentEmail,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\IFluentEmail.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FluentEmail.Core.IFluentEmail' FluentEmail.Core.Interfaces.ISender
Rebellious Hierarchy,FluentEmail.Core,FluentEmailFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lukencode_FluentEmail\src\FluentEmail.Core\FluentEmailFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
