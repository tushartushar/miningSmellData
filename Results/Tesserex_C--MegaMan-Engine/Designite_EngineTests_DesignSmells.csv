Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,MovementComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\MovementComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Movement_ChangesDirection which is more interested in members of the type: MovementComponent
Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,MovementComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\MovementComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Movement_Push which is more interested in members of the type: MovementComponent
Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,MovementComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\MovementComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Movement_OppositePushes which is more interested in members of the type: MovementComponent
Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,MovementComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\MovementComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Movement_ComplimentaryPushes which is more interested in members of the type: MovementComponent
Unutilized Abstraction,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,PositionComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\PositionComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,PositionComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\PositionComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetPositionWithPoint which is more interested in members of the type: PositionComponent
Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,PositionComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\PositionComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetPositionWithValues which is more interested in members of the type: PositionComponent
Feature Envy,MegaMan.Engine.Tests.Components,PositionComponentTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tesserex_C--MegaMan-Engine\EngineTests\Components\PositionComponentTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Offset which is more interested in members of the type: PositionComponent
