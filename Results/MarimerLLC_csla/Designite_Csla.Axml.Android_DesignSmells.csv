Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Model
Imperative Abstraction,Csla.Axml,ViewModelBase<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitAsync
Multifaceted Abstraction,Csla.Axml,ViewModelBase<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,Csla.Axml,ActivityBase<T;Z>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Axml.Android\ActivityBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Csla.Axml,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Axml.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Csla.Axml,String,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Axml.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Csla.Axml,ViewModelBase<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ManageObjectLifetimeProperty
Deficient Encapsulation,Csla.Axml,String,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Axml.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ApplicationName
Deficient Encapsulation,Csla.Axml,String,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Axml.Android\obj\Debug\81\designtime\Resource.designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ApplicationName
Insufficient Modularization,Csla.Axml,ViewModelBase<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
