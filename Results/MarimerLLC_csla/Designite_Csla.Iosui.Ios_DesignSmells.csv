Unnecessary Abstraction,Csla.Xaml,ExecuteEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ExecuteEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TriggerSource' MethodParameter' TriggerParameter
Unnecessary Abstraction,Csla.Xaml,IViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\IViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Model
Unutilized Abstraction,Csla.Xaml,ViewModel<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Csla.Xaml,ViewModelBase<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.Xaml.Shared\ViewModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitAsync
