Unnecessary Abstraction,TestApp,App,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,TestApp,App,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: TestApp.App' Permissions.App
Unutilized Abstraction,TestApp,Window1,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\Window1.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unutilized Abstraction,TestApp,SecurityEntities,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\Security.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TestApp,SecurityEntities,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\Security.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SecurityEntities (C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\Security.Designer.cs' [177' 243])' SecurityEntities (C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\Security.Designer.cs' [285' 351])

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestApp.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\NET\cs\Permissions\Permissions\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
