Duplicate Abstraction,DataBindingApp,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Form1 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Form1.cs' [26' 48])' Form2 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Form2.cs' [26' 48])

Feature Envy,DataBindingApp,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Form1_Load which is more interested in members of the type: ListObject
Feature Envy,DataBindingApp,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: button1_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ListObject
Unutilized Abstraction,DataBindingApp,Form2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Form2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataBindingApp.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Source\Csla.test\DataBinding\DataBindingApp\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
