Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PTWin,ApplicationContextManager,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\ApplicationContextManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PTWin,MainForm,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainForm (C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\MainForm.cs' [132' 151])' MainForm (C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\MainForm.cs' [235' 254])
Imperative Abstraction,PTWin,ProjectEdit,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\ProjectEdit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Imperative Abstraction,PTWin,ResourceEdit,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\ResourceEdit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,PTWin,StatusBusy,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\StatusBusy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PTWin.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unfactored Hierarchy,PTWin,ProjectEdit,C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\ProjectEdit.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  ProjectEdit (C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\ProjectEdit.cs' [80' 113])' ResourceEdit (C:\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Ui.WinForms\ResourceEdit.cs' [76' 109])
