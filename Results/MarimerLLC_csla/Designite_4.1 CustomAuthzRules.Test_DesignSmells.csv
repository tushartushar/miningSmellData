Unnecessary Abstraction,CustomAuthzRules.Test,OnlyForUSTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\RuleTutorial\CustomAuthzRules.Test\OnlyForUSTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CustomAuthzRules.Test,OnlyForUSTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MarimerLLC_csla\Samples\RuleTutorial\CustomAuthzRules.Test\OnlyForUSTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
