Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Status' File
Duplicate Abstraction,DotNetSmartBuild.Repository.Ent,GitFileStatus,C:\repos\williancarvalho_DotNetSmartBuild\src\DotNetSmartBuild.Repository\Ent\GitFileStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GitFileStatus[1' 20]' GitCommit[1' 20]' ReleaseNote[1' 20]' SvnRepository[1' 20]' IRepository[1' 20]
Duplicate Abstraction,DotNetSmartBuild.Repository.Ent,GitCommit,C:\repos\williancarvalho_DotNetSmartBuild\src\DotNetSmartBuild.Repository\Ent\GitCommit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GitCommit[1' 21]' ReleaseNote[1' 21]' SvnRepository[1' 21]' IRepository[1' 21]
Imperative Abstraction,DotNetSmartBuild.Repository.Imp,GitRepository,C:\repos\williancarvalho_DotNetSmartBuild\src\DotNetSmartBuild.Repository\Imp\GitRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class.
