Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Dryad.ClusterInterface,ILogger,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILogger (C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs' [1' 21])' HttpCluster (C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\HttpScheduler.cs' [1' 21])' Process (C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Process.cs' [1' 21])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Dryad.ClusterInterface,IProcess,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
