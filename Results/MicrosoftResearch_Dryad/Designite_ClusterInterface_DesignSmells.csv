Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Dryad.ClusterInterface,ILogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ILogger (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs' [1' 21])' HttpCluster (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\HttpScheduler.cs' [1' 21])' Process (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Process.cs' [1' 21])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Dryad.ClusterInterface,IProcess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Directory
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Dryad.ClusterInterface,ProcessState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Dryad\ClusterInterface\Interfaces.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
