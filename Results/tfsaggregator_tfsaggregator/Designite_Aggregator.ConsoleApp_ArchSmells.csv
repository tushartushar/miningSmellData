Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Feature Concentration,Aggregator.ConsoleApp,Aggregator.ConsoleApp,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ExceptionExtensions]' [ConsoleTextLogger]' [Notification]' [Program]' [RequestContext' RunCommand' ConsoleEventLogger]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.71,Aggregator.ConsoleApp.ExceptionExtensions' Aggregator.ConsoleApp.ConsoleTextLogger' Aggregator.ConsoleApp.Notification' Aggregator.ConsoleApp.Program
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
