Unutilized Abstraction,DocGen,Generator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\Generator.Chm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DocGen,TableItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\Generator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Provider' Feature' Linq' Implementation
Deficient Encapsulation,DocGen,FileItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\FileItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsFile' Name' Items' Parent' Group' Indexes' NoIndexes' NoIndex
Deficient Encapsulation,DocGen,TableItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\Generator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Provider' Feature' Linq' Implementation
Deficient Encapsulation,DocGen,IndexItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\IndexItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Text' Files' Index
Deficient Encapsulation,DocGen,IndexItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\IndexItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Index
Deficient Encapsulation,DocGen,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\Program.Chm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: rss' destPath
Deficient Encapsulation,DocGen,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\Program.Chm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: rss' destPath
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DocGen,FileItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\FileItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DocGen.FileItem' DocGen.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DocGen,FileItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\DocGen\FileItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
