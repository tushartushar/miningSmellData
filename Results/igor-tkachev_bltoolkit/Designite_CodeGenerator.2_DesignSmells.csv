Unutilized Abstraction,BLToolkit.Common,Convert<T;P>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\CodeGenerator\Convert.Declare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BLToolkit.Common,ConvertPartial<T;P>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\igor-tkachev_bltoolkit\Tools\CodeGenerator\Convert.Declare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
