Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,CSM.DataLayer,GlobalDL,C:\repos\deCost_csm\CSM\CSM.DataAccess\GlobalDL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: GlobalDL[1480' 1508]' GlobalDL[1582' 1610]
Unnecessary Abstraction,CSM.DataAccess,iSQLMgr,C:\repos\deCost_csm\CSM\CSM.DataAccess\iSQLMgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,CSM.DataLayer,GlobalDL,C:\repos\deCost_csm\CSM\CSM.DataAccess\GlobalDL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,CSM.DataLayer,GlobalDL,C:\repos\deCost_csm\CSM\CSM.DataAccess\GlobalDL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,CSM.DataLayer,GlobalDL,C:\repos\deCost_csm\CSM\CSM.DataAccess\GlobalDL.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 569
Unfactored Hierarchy,CSM.DataLayer,MySQLMgr,C:\repos\deCost_csm\CSM\CSM.DataAccess\MySQLMgr.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: MySQLMgr[116' 140]' SSQLMgr[116' 140]
