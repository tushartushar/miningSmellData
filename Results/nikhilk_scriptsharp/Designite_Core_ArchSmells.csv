Feature Concentration,Core,Sharpen,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Application' Behavior' BehaviorRegistration' ServiceRegistration' BinderManager' OptionsParser' Binder]' [Expression]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,Sharpen.Expression,Sharpen.Application' Sharpen.Behavior' Sharpen.BehaviorRegistration' Sharpen.ServiceRegistration' Sharpen.Binder' Sharpen.BinderManager' Sharpen.Expression' Sharpen.OptionsParser
Feature Concentration,Core,Sharpen.Bindings,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BindExpression]' [ContentBinder' PropertyBinder' ValueBinder' VisibilityBinder]' [EventBinder]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,Sharpen.Bindings.BindExpression' Sharpen.Bindings.EventBinder,Sharpen.Bindings.BindExpression' Sharpen.Bindings.ContentBinder' Sharpen.Bindings.EventBinder' Sharpen.Bindings.PropertyBinder' Sharpen.Bindings.ValueBinder' Sharpen.Bindings.VisibilityBinder
Scattered Functionality,Core,Sharpen.Bindings,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sharpen' System,Sharpen.Expression' System.IDisposable' System.String' Sharpen.Application' System.Object' Sharpen.Behavior,Sharpen.Expression' System.IDisposable' System.String' Sharpen.Application' System.Object' Sharpen.Behavior
