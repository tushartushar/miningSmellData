Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptSharp.Preprocessor,CondenserTextReader,C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\Preprocessor\CondenserTextReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,ScriptSharp,PreprocessorOptions,C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\PreprocessorOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DebugFlavor' Minimize' PreprocessorVariables' SourceFile' StripCommentsOnly' TargetFile' UseWindowsLineBreaks' _preprocessorVariables' _sourceFile' _targetFile' _stripCommentsOnly' _useWindowsLineBreaks' _debug' _minimize
Unfactored Hierarchy,ScriptSharp,FileInputStreamSource,C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\FileInputStreamSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FileInputStreamSource (C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\FileInputStreamSource.cs' [22' 46])' FileOutputStreamSource (C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\FileOutputStreamSource.cs' [22' 46])
