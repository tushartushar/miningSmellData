Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ScriptSharp.Preprocessor,CondenserTextReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\Preprocessor\CondenserTextReader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RaiseError which is more interested in members of the type: PreprocessorTextReader
Broken Modularization,ScriptSharp,PreprocessorOptions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\PreprocessorOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DebugFlavor' Minimize' PreprocessorVariables' SourceFile' StripCommentsOnly' TargetFile' UseWindowsLineBreaks' _preprocessorVariables' _sourceFile' _targetFile' _stripCommentsOnly' _useWindowsLineBreaks' _debug' _minimize
Unfactored Hierarchy,ScriptSharp,FileInputStreamSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\FileInputStreamSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FileInputStreamSource (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\FileInputStreamSource.cs' [22' 46])' FileOutputStreamSource (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\tools\Preprocessor\FileOutputStreamSource.cs' [22' 46])
