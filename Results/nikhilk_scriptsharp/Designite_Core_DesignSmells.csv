Unnecessary Abstraction,Sharpen,BehaviorRegistration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\fx\Sharpen\Core\BehaviorRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BehaviorType' ServiceType

Insufficient Modularization,Sharpen,Application,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\fx\Sharpen\Core\Application.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sharpen,Application,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\fx\Sharpen\Core\Application.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sharpen.Application' Sharpen.Behavior' Sharpen.BinderManager
