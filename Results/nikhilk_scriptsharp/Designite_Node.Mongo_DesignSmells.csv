Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoConnector,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoConnector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoDatabase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoDatabase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoCursor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoCursor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodeApi.MongoDB.MongoCursor' NodeApi.MongoDB.MongoCollection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoDatabase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoDatabase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodeApi.MongoDB.MongoDatabase' NodeApi.MongoDB.MongoCollection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodeApi.MongoDB,MongoCursor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Mongo\MongoCursor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
