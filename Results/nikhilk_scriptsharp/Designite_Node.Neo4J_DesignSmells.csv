Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NodeApi.Neo4j,GraphDatabase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Neo4j\GraphDatabase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodeApi.Neo4j,GraphPath,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Neo4j\GraphPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphPath' NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphNode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodeApi.Neo4j,GraphRelationship,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Neo4j\GraphRelationship.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphRelationship' NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphNode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodeApi.Neo4j,GraphPath,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Neo4j\GraphPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphPath' NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphNode' NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphRelationship
Broken Hierarchy,NodeApi.Neo4j,GraphRelationship,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Neo4j\GraphRelationship.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphPropertyContainer
Broken Hierarchy,NodeApi.Neo4j,GraphNode,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Libraries\Node\Node.Neo4j\GraphNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NodeApi.Neo4j.GraphPropertyContainer
