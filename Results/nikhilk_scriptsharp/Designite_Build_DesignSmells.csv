Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptSharp.Tasks,ResXCodeGeneratorTask,C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\Build\Tasks\ResXCodeGeneratorTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ScriptSharp.Tasks,ScriptCompilerExecTask,C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\Build\Tasks\ScriptCompilerExecTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute

Broken Hierarchy,ScriptSharp.Tasks,TaskItemInputStreamSource,C:\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\Build\Tasks\ScriptCompilerExecTask.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ScriptSharp.FileInputStreamSource
