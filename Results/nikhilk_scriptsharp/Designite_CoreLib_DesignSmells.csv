This class has following sub-classes: ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.EventAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.FieldAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.GenericParameterAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.MethodAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.MethodImplAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.MethodSemanticsAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.ParameterAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.PInvokeAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.PropertyAttributes' ScriptSharp.Importer.IL.SecurityAction
Cyclic Hierarchy,System.Threading,Deferred,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\CoreLib\Threading\Deferred.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Deferred<T>
Broken Hierarchy,System.Threading,Deferred<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\CoreLib\Threading\Deferred.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Threading.Deferred
Cyclic Hierarchy,System.Threading,Task,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\CoreLib\Threading\Task.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Task<T>
Broken Hierarchy,System.Threading,Task<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nikhilk_scriptsharp\src\Core\CoreLib\Threading\Task.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Threading.Task
