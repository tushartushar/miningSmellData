Unnecessary Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.Annotations,AssertionMethodAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Annotations\ReSharperAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Machine.Specifications,ShouldExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\ShouldExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.ComparerStrategies,ObjectExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\ComparerStrategies\ObjectExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.ComparerStrategies,TypeExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\ComparerStrategies\TypeExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reflection,ReflectionPolyfillExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Utility\Internal\ReflectionPolyfillExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.Utility,SequenceNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Utility\ObjectGraphHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ValueGetters
Unnecessary Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.Utility,INode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Utility\ObjectGraphHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.Utility,KeyValueNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Utility\ObjectGraphHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: KeyValues
Unnecessary Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.Utility,LiteralNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Utility\ObjectGraphHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Machine.Specifications.Utility,Member,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\Utility\ObjectGraphHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' ValueGetter
Insufficient Modularization,Machine.Specifications,ShouldExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\ShouldExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 56 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Machine.Specifications,ShouldExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\ShouldExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Machine.Specifications,ShouldExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\machine_machine.specifications\src\Machine.Specifications.Should\ShouldExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 144
