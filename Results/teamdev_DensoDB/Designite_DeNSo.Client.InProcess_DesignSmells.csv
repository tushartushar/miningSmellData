Deficient Encapsulation,DeNSo,EventCommandStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\teamdev_DensoDB\Windows\DeNSo.Client.InProcess\EventCommandStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value
Insufficient Modularization,DeNSo,Session,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\teamdev_DensoDB\Windows\DeNSo.Client.InProcess\Session.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DeNSo,Session,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\teamdev_DensoDB\Windows\DeNSo.Client.InProcess\Session.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeNSo,EventCommandStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\teamdev_DensoDB\Windows\DeNSo.Client.InProcess\EventCommandStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DeNSo.EventCommandStatus' DeNSo.ISession
