Unutilized Abstraction,Simple.Data.InMemoryTest,CanAssignArray,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\Simple.Data.InMemoryTest\CanAssignArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simple.Data.InMemoryTest,People,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\Simple.Data.InMemoryTest\CanAssignArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Names

Insufficient Modularization,Simple.Data.InMemoryTest,InMemoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\Simple.Data.InMemoryTest\InMemoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 56 public methods
