Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PerformanceTestConsole,TestAssertions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\PerformanceTestConsole\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PerformanceTestConsole,SqlDataReaderHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\PerformanceTestConsole\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,PerformanceTestConsole,Post,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\PerformanceTestConsole\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Text' CreationDate' LastChangeDate' Counter1' Counter2' Counter3' Counter4' Counter5' Counter6' Counter7' Counter8' Counter9
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceTestConsole,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\PerformanceTestConsole\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceTestConsole.Program' PerformanceTestConsole.PerformanceTests
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceTestConsole,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\PerformanceTestConsole\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceTestConsole.Tests' PerformanceTestConsole.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceTestConsole,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\markrendle_Simple.Data\PerformanceTestConsole\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceTestConsole.Program' PerformanceTestConsole.Tests' PerformanceTestConsole.PerformanceTests
