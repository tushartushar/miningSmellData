Missing Hierarchy,IsAndAsOperators,PalyWithOperatorsIsAndAs,C:\repos\pdrosos_TelerikAcademy\OOP\06. Common Type System\Lectures\Common-Type-System-Demos\Is-and-as-Operators\IsAndAsOperators.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Base' Derived (in method "Main" of class "PalyWithOperatorsIsAndAs").
