Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Examples.Domain.Location,ICity,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Examples\Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Examples.Domain\Location\ICity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CityNames' LocalizableName
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Examples.Domain.Location,ICityName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Examples\Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Examples.Domain\Location\ICityName.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
