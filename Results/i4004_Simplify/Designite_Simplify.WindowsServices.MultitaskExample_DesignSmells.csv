Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample,ServiceInstaller,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Examples\Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample\ServiceInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample,ServiceInstaller,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Examples\Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample\ServiceInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample,TaskProcessor1,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Examples\Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample\TaskProcessor1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample,TaskProcessor2,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Examples\Simplify.WindowsServices.MultitaskExample\TaskProcessor2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
