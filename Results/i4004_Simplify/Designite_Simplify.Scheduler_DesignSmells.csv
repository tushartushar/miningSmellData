Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Scheduler.Jobs.Crontab,ICrontabSchedulerJob,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\Jobs\Crontab\ICrontabSchedulerJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Settings' CrontabProcessor
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Scheduler.Jobs.Crontab,ICrontabSchedulerJobTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\Jobs\Crontab\ICrontabSchedulerJobTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Job' Task
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Scheduler.Jobs,IJobArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\Jobs\IJobArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AppName' StartupArgs
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Scheduler.Jobs.Settings,ISchedulerJobSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\Jobs\Settings\ISchedulerJobSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CrontabExpression' ProcessingInterval' CleanupOnTaskFinish' MaximumParallelTasksCount
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Simplify.Scheduler,MultitaskScheduler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\MultitaskScheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Simplify.Scheduler.MultitaskScheduler' Simplify.Scheduler.SchedulerJobsHandler
Broken Hierarchy,Simplify.Scheduler,BasicScheduler<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\BasicScheduler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Simplify.Scheduler.MultitaskScheduler
Cyclic Hierarchy,Simplify.Scheduler,SchedulerJobsHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\SchedulerJobsHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MultitaskScheduler
Broken Hierarchy,Simplify.Scheduler,SingleTaskScheduler<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\SingleTaskScheduler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Simplify.Scheduler.MultitaskScheduler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Simplify.Scheduler.Jobs,SchedulerJob<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Scheduler\Jobs\SchedulerJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start' Stop
