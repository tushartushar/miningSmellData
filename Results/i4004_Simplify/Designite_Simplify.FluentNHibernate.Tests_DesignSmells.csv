Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests,ConfigurationExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests\ConfigurationExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests,SessionExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests\SessionExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests,StatelessSessionExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests\StatelessSessionExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests.Entities.Accounts,User,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.FluentNHibernate.Tests\Entities\Accounts\User.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Password' EMail' LastActivityTime
