Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.Pipelines,ChainHandler<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Pipelines\ChainHandler{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Pipelines.Processing,IResultingPipelineStage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Pipelines\Processing\IResultingPipelineStage{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ErrorResult
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Pipelines.Validation,DataRule<TData;T;TResult>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Pipelines\Validation\DataRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Pipelines.Validation,IDataRule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Pipelines\Validation\IDataRule{T}.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data
Rebellious Hierarchy,Simplify.Pipelines.Validation,Rule<T;TResult>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Pipelines\Validation\Rule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Check' GenerateInvalidAction
