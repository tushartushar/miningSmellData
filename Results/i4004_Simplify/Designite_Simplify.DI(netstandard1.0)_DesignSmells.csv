Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.DI,DIContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\DIContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Current' _current
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.DI,DIContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\DIContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.DI,DIRegistratorExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\DIRegistratorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.DI,DIResolverExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\DIResolverExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.DI,IDIContainerProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\IDIContainerProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.DI,ILifetimeScope,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\ILifetimeScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Resolver
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Simplify.DI.Provider.DryIoc,DryIocDIProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.DI\Provider.DryIoc\DryIocDIProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Simplify.DI.Provider.DryIoc.DryIocDIProvider' Simplify.DI.Provider.DryIoc.DryIocLifetimeScope
