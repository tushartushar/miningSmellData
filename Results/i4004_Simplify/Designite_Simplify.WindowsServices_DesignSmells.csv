Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.WindowsServices.Jobs,ICrontabServiceJob,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.WindowsServices\Jobs\ICrontabServiceJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Settings' CrontabProcessor
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.WindowsServices.Jobs,IServiceJobSettings,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.WindowsServices\Jobs\IServiceJobSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CrontabExpression' ProcessingInterval' CleanupOnTaskFinish
Broken Hierarchy,Simplify.WindowsServices,BasicServiceHandler,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.WindowsServices\BasicServiceHandler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MultitaskServiceHandler
Broken Hierarchy,Simplify.WindowsServices,SingleTaskServiceHandler,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.WindowsServices\SingleTaskServiceHandler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MultitaskServiceHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Simplify.WindowsServices.Jobs,ServiceJob,D:\newReposJune17\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.WindowsServices\Jobs\ServiceJob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start' Stop
