Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.Templates.Tests,IntegrationTemplateTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Templates.Tests\IntegrationTemplateTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Simplify.Templates.Tests,TemplateModelExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Templates.Tests\TemplateModelExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Simplify.Templates.Tests,TemplateModelExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Templates.Tests\TemplateModelExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Set_NullModel_ReplacesWithNothing which is more interested in members of the type: ITemplate

Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Templates.Tests.Models,BaseTestModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Templates.Tests\Models\BaseTestModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID
Unnecessary Abstraction,Simplify.Templates.Tests.Models,ChildTestModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\i4004_Simplify\src\Simplify.Templates.Tests\Models\ChildTestModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
