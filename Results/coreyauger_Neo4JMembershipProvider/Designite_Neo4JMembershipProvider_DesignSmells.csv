Unnecessary Abstraction,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership.Data,Role,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Membership.Data\Role.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RoleName' RoleDescription
Multifaceted Abstraction,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unutilized Abstraction,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Neo4JMembershipProvider[1230' 1266]' Neo4JMembershipProvider[1285' 1321]
Duplicate Abstraction,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Neo4JMembershipProvider[1777' 1798]' Neo4JMembershipProvider[1834' 1855]
Unutilized Abstraction,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JRolesProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JRoleProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership.Data,User,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Membership.Data\User.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Username' Email' ApplicationName' Comment' CreationDate' IsApproved' LastActivityDate' ProviderUserKey' PasswordQuestion' IsLockedOut' LastLoginDate' LastPasswordChangedDate' LastLockedOutDate' Password' PasswordAnswer' FailedPasswordAttemptCount' FailedPasswordAttemptWindowStart' FailedPasswordAnswerAttemptCount' FailedPasswordAnswerAttemptWindowStart' ResetToken' ResetTokenExpire' AccountConfirmToken' IsConfirmed
Insufficient Modularization,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 187
Rebellious Hierarchy,Nextwave.Neo4J.Membership,Neo4JMembershipProvider,C:\repos\coreyauger_Neo4JMembershipProvider\Neo4JMembership.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DeleteOAuthAccount' DeleteOAuthToken' ReplaceOAuthRequestTokenWithAccessToken' StoreOAuthRequestToken' CreateOrUpdateOAuthAccount
