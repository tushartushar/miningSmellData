Imperative Abstraction,ExpressionToString,ExpressionStringBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\App_Packages\ExpressionStringBuilder.0.9.2\ExpressionStringBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.FluentMVCTesting,ControllerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\ControllerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.FluentMVCTesting,RouteValueDictionaryExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\RouteValueDictionaryExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,TestStack.FluentMVCTesting,ControllerResultTest<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\ControllerResultTest\ControllerResultTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TestStack.FluentMVCTesting,ControllerResultTest<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\TestStack.FluentMVCTesting\ControllerResultTest\ControllerResultTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
