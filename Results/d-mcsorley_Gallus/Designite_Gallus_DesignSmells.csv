Unutilized Abstraction,Gallus,Gallus,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Gallus,Mapper<TFirst;TSecond;TThird;TFourth;TFifth;TSixth;TSeventh;TEighth;TNinth;TTenth;TEleventh;TTwelfth;TThirteenth;TFourteenth;TFifteenth;TSixteenth>,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MapFromReader

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Gallus,DoNotMap,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Gallus,DoubleKeyDictionary<TKey1;TKey2;TValue>,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Gallus,Gallus,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 95 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Gallus,Gallus,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 97 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Gallus,Gallus,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 123
Broken Hierarchy,Gallus,ClassMap<T>,C:\repos\d-mcsorley_Gallus\Gallus\Gallus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gallus.ClassMap
