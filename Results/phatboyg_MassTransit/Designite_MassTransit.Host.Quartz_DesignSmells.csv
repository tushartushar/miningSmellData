Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.Host.Quartz,ConfigureMessageScheduler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Samples\MassTransit.Host.Quartz\ConfigureMessageScheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Configurator' SchedulerAddress' _schedulerAddress
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.Host.Quartz,IConfigureMessageScheduler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Samples\MassTransit.Host.Quartz\IConfigureMessageScheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Configurator' SchedulerAddress
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.Host.Quartz,QuartzEndpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Samples\MassTransit.Host.Quartz\QuartzEndpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.Host.Quartz,QuartzModule,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Samples\MassTransit.Host.Quartz\QuartzModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.Host.Quartz,QuartzService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Samples\MassTransit.Host.Quartz\QuartzService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
