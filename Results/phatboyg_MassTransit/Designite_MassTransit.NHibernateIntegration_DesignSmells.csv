Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' InformationalVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration,BinaryGuidType,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration\BinaryGuidType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration,NHibernateSessionFactoryProvider,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration\NHibernateSessionFactoryProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration,SagaClassMapping<T>,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration\SagaClassMapping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration,SqlServerSessionFactoryProvider,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration\SqlServerSessionFactoryProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration,UriUserType,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration\UriUserType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
