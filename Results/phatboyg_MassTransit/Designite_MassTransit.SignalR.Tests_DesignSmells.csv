Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests,HubLifeTimeManagerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\HubLifeTimeManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests,MassTransitHubLifetimeManagerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\MassTransitHubLifetimeManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests,TestObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\MassTransitHubLifetimeManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests,ScaleoutHubLifetimeManagerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\ScaleoutHubLifetimeManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests,MyHub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\ScaleoutHubLifetimeManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests,IHubManagerConsumerFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\Utils\IHubManagerConsumerFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HubLifetimeManager
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,TaskExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\OfficialFramework\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Rebellious Hierarchy,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests.OfficialFramework,MockHubConnectionContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\OfficialFramework\HubConnectionContextUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteAsync
Rebellious Hierarchy,MassTransit.SignalR.Tests.OfficialFramework,MemoryBufferWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.SignalR.Tests\OfficialFramework\MemoryBufferWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' FlushAsync' Read' Seek' SetLength
