Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,ApplicationInsightsMiddlewareConfiguratorExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\ApplicationInsightsMiddlewareConfiguratorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MassTransit.ApplicationInsights.Configuration,ApplicationInsightsConsumeSpecification<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Configuration\ApplicationInsightsConsumeSpecification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ApplicationInsightsConsumeSpecification<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Configuration\ApplicationInsightsConsumeSpecification.cs' [1' 24])' ApplicationInsightsPublishSpecification<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Configuration\ApplicationInsightsPublishSpecification.cs' [1' 24])
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.ApplicationInsights.Configuration,ApplicationInsightsDefaultConfiguration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Configuration\ApplicationInsightsDefaultConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DefaultTelemetryHeaderRootKey' DefaultTelemetryHeaderParentKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.ApplicationInsights.Pipeline,ApplicationInsightsPayload,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsPayload.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,MassTransit.ApplicationInsights.Pipeline,ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter.cs' [1' 24])' ApplicationInsightsSendFilter<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsSendFilter.cs' [1' 24])
Duplicate Abstraction,MassTransit.ApplicationInsights.Pipeline,ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsPublishFilter.cs' [78' 122])' ApplicationInsightsSendFilter<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\MassTransit.ApplicationInsights\Pipeline\ApplicationInsightsSendFilter.cs' [78' 122])
