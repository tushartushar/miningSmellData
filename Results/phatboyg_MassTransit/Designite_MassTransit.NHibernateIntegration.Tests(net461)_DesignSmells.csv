Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,DbQuery,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\DbQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,GirlfriendYelling,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\StorageSpec_Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CorrelationId
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,GotHitByACar,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\StorageSpec_Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CorrelationId
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,SodOff,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\StorageSpec_Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CorrelationId
Feature Envy,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,When_using_NHibernateRepository,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\UsingNHibernate_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Should_have_removed_the_state_machine which is more interested in members of the type: ISagaRepository
Imperative Abstraction,MissingTests,When_an_existing_instance_is_not_found,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\MissingInstance_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Should_publish_the_event_of_the_missing_instance
Duplicate Abstraction,MissingTests,TestStateMachine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\MissingInstance_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: MissingTests.TestStateMachine' PreInsert.TestStateMachine
Duplicate Abstraction,MissingTests,Start,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\MissingInstance_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: MissingTests.Start' PreInsert.Start
Unnecessary Abstraction,MissingTests,StartupComplete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\MissingInstance_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ServiceId' ServiceName
Duplicate Abstraction,MissingTests,StartupComplete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\MissingInstance_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: MissingTests.StartupComplete' PreInsert.StartupComplete
Duplicate Abstraction,PreInsert,InstanceMap,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\PreInsert_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  InstanceMap (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\PreInsert_Specs.cs' [109' 144])' InstanceMap (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\PreInsert_Specs.cs' [193' 228])
Unnecessary Abstraction,PreInsert,Instance,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\PreInsert_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CurrentState' CreateTimestamp' Name' CorrelationId
Unnecessary Abstraction,PreInsert,StartupComplete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\PreInsert_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TransactionId
Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,SingleConnectionSessionFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\SingleConnectionSessionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests,SingleConnectionSessionFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Persistence\MassTransit.NHibernateIntegration.Tests\SingleConnectionSessionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
