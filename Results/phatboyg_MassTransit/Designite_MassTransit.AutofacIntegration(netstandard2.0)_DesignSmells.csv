Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacAutomatonymousReceiveEndpointExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacAutomatonymousReceiveEndpointExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacConsumerRegistrationExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacConsumerRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacObserverExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacObserverExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacReceiveEndpointExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacReceiveEndpointExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacRegistrationExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacStateMachineLoadSagaExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacStateMachineLoadSagaExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,AutofacStateMachineRegisterSagaExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacStateMachineRegisterSagaExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit.AutofacIntegration,AutofacLifetimeScopeExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacLifetimeScopeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MassTransit.AutofacIntegration,RegistryLifetimeScopeProvider<TId>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\RegistryLifetimeScopeProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetScopeId which is more interested in members of the type: ILifetimeScopeRegistry
Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit,AutofacReceiveEndpointExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.AutofacIntegration\AutofacReceiveEndpointExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
