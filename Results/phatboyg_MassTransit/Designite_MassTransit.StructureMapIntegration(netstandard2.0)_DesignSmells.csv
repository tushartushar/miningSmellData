Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit,StructureMapRegistrationExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Containers\MassTransit.StructureMapIntegration\StructureMapRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
