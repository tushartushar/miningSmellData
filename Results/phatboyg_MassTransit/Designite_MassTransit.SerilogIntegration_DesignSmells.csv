Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' InformationalVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,SerilogConfiguratorExtensions,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Loggers\MassTransit.SerilogIntegration\SeriLogConfiguratorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit.SeriLogIntegration,SerilogLog,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Loggers\MassTransit.SerilogIntegration\SerilogLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit.SeriLogIntegration,SerilogLog,C:\repos\phatboyg_MassTransit\src\Loggers\MassTransit.SerilogIntegration\SerilogLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
