Feature Envy,SoundFingerprinting.Audio.NAudio,NAudioWaveFileUtility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AddictedCS_soundfingerprinting\src\SoundFingerprinting.Audio.NAudio\NAudioWaveFileUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RecodeFileToMonoWave which is more interested in members of the type: INAudioFactory
