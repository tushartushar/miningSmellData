Unutilized Abstraction,BgApiDriver.Tests,CommandTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahouben_BleDriver.NET\BgApiDriver.Tests\CommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BgApiDriver.Tests,CommandTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahouben_BleDriver.NET\BgApiDriver.Tests\CommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CommandTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahouben_BleDriver.NET\BgApiDriver.Tests\CommandTests.cs' [1' 23])' SignExtensionTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahouben_BleDriver.NET\BgApiDriver.Tests\SignExtensionTests.cs' [1' 23])
Feature Envy,BgApiDriver.Tests,CommandTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahouben_BleDriver.NET\BgApiDriver.Tests\CommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HelloAddressGetTest which is more interested in members of the type: MyBgApi
