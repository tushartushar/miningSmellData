(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Last.fm,MainPage,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Last.fm.Utils,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\Utils\MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: MD5CryptoServiceProvider[483' 503]' MD5CryptoServiceProvider[518' 538]
Multifaceted Abstraction,Last.fm.Utils,MD5,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\Utils\MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Unutilized Abstraction,Last.fm.Views,Login,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\Views\Login.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Last.fm.Requests,Request,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\Requests\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: serviceUri
Broken Hierarchy,Last.fm.Utils,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\Utils\MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MD5
Cyclic Hierarchy,Last.fm.Utils,MD5,C:\repos\alinaish_Lastfm\Last.fm\Utils\MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MD5CryptoServiceProvider
