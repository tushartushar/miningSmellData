Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Diagnostics.Contracts,PureAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\Microsoft.Contracts\Contracts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,System.Diagnostics.Contracts,Contract,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\Microsoft.Contracts\Contracts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Diagnostics.Contracts,Contract,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\Microsoft.Contracts\Contracts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Diagnostics.Contracts.Contract' System.Diagnostics.Contracts.Internal.ContractHelper
