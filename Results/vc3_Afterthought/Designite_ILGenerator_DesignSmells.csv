Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 126
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Microsoft.CCI\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.Cci.ILGenerator' Microsoft.Cci.ILGeneratorMethodBody
