Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Afterthought.UnitTest.Target,ILog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Afterthought.UnitTest.Target\ILog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: e
Deficient Encapsulation,Afterthought.UnitTest.Target,Calculator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Afterthought.UnitTest.Target\Calculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: holding1' ConstructorSetInt
Insufficient Modularization,Afterthought.UnitTest.Target,Calculator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Afterthought.UnitTest.Target\Calculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Afterthought.UnitTest.Target,Calculator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Afterthought.UnitTest.Target\Calculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Afterthought.UnitTest.Target.Calculator' Afterthought.UnitTest.Target.TestAmendment<T>
Broken Hierarchy,Afterthought.UnitTest.Target,TestAmendment<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vc3_Afterthought\Afterthought.UnitTest.Target\TestAmendment.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Afterthought.Amendment
