Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,System.Workflow.Runtime-net_3_5,System.Workflow.Runtime,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: System.Workflow.Runtime' System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting,System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowQueuingService' System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime' System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowProcessor' System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService' System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.DefaultWorkflowLoaderService
Unstable Dependency,System.Workflow.Runtime-net_3_5,System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): System.Workflow.Runtime,System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntime
Feature Concentration,System.Workflow.Runtime-net_3_5,System.Workflow.Runtime,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [WorkflowQueuingService' WorkflowQueue' WorkflowInstance' WorkflowTerminatedEventArgs' WorkflowEventArgs' WorkflowCompletedEventArgs' TimerEventSubscription' TimerEventSubscriptionCollection' IPendingWork' WorkflowProcessor' WorkflowRuntime]' [CorrelationProperty]' [CorrelationToken' CorrelationTokenEventArgs]' [WorkflowStatus]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.27,System.Workflow.Runtime.CorrelationProperty' System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowStatus
