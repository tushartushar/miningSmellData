Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,System,MonoTODOAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\build\common\MonoTODOAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MonoTODOAttribute (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\build\common\MonoTODOAttribute.cs' [14' 33])' XmlNodeWriter (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\class\Mono.XsltDebugger\Mono.Xml\XmlNodeWriter.cs' [10' 29])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mono.XsltDebugger,XsltOutputBreakpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\class\Mono.XsltDebugger\Mono.XsltDebugger\XsltDebuggerBreakpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,System.Xml,XmlNodeWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\class\Mono.XsltDebugger\Mono.Xml\XmlNodeWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Xml,XmlNodeWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\class\Mono.XsltDebugger\Mono.Xml\XmlNodeWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Xml,XmlNodeWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\class\Mono.XsltDebugger\Mono.Xml\XmlNodeWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' WriteBinHex' WriteSurrogateCharEntity
Broken Hierarchy,Mono.XsltDebugger,XsltOutputBreakpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_olive\class\Mono.XsltDebugger\Mono.XsltDebugger\XsltDebuggerBreakpoint.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mono.XsltDebugger.XsltDebuggerBreakpoint
