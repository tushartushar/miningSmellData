Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
God Component,HidLibrary,HidLibrary,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 32,HidLibrary.ReadStatus' HidLibrary.DeviceInfo' HidLibrary.DeviceMode
Feature Concentration,HidLibrary,HidLibrary,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Extensions]' [HidAsyncState' HidDevice' HidDeviceAttributes' HidDeviceCapabilities' HidDeviceData' ReadStatus' HidDeviceEventMonitor' HidFastReadDevice' HidFastReadEnumerator' IHidEnumerator' HidEnumerator' HidDevices' DeviceInfo' HidReport' DeviceMode' ShareMode' IHidDevice' NativeMethods' SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES' SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA' SP_DEVINFO_DATA' SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA' DEVPROPKEY' HIDD_ATTRIBUTES' HIDP_CAPS]' [OVERLAPPED]' [DEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE]' [DEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE_1]' [DEV_BROADCAST_HANDLE]' [DEV_BROADCAST_HDR]' [HIDP_VALUE_CAPS].
