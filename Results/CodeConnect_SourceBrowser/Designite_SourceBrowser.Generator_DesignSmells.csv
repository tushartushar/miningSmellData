Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Parent' Name' Children' RelativePath
Unnecessary Abstraction,SourceBrowser.Generator.Model,ILink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\Model\ILink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Link
Unutilized Abstraction,SourceBrowser.Generator,SolutionAnalayzer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\SolutionAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,SourceBrowser.Generator.Transformers,AbstractWorkspaceVisitor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\Transformers\AbstractWorkspaceVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: FolderModel' DocumentModel (in method "VisitProjectItem" of class "AbstractWorkspaceVisitor").
Deficient Encapsulation,SourceBrowser.Generator.Transformers,TokenLookupTransformer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\Transformers\TokenLookupTransformer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TokenLookup
Broken Modularization,SourceBrowser.Generator.Model.CSharp,CSharpTokenTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\Model\CSharp\CSharpTokenTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMMENT' IDENTIFIER' KEYWORD' TYPE' STRING' OTHER
Broken Modularization,SourceBrowser.Generator.Model.VisualBasic,VisualBasicTokenTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\Model\VisualBasic\VisualBasicTokenTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' COMMENT' IDENTIFIER' KEYWORD' TYPE' STRING' OTHER
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SourceBrowser.Generator.Model,DocumentModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CodeConnect_SourceBrowser\src\SourceBrowser.Generator\Model\DocumentModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
