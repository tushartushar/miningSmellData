Feature Envy,Dwarrowdelf.Client.UI,TileAreaView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Common\TileAreaView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnMapObjectChanged which is more interested in members of the type: MovableObjectCollection
