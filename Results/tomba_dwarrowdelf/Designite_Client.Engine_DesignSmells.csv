Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ChangeHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\ChangeHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleChange which is more interested in members of the type: World
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ClientSaveData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\ClientSaveHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Objects
Feature Envy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ClientUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\ClientUser.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleMessage which is more interested in members of the type: World
Unutilized Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ConnectManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\ConnectManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,EmbeddedServerOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\EmbeddedServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ServerMode' NewGameOptions' SaveGamePath' CleanSaveDir
Unutilized Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,IPRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\IPRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ReportHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\ReportHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleReport which is more interested in members of the type: World
Unutilized Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,TurnHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\TurnHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ClientSaveData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\ClientSaveHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Objects
Deficient Encapsulation,Dwarrowdelf.Client,EmbeddedServerOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\EmbeddedServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServerMode' NewGameOptions' SaveGamePath' CleanSaveDir
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,MyStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\Engine\IPRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Read' Seek' SetLength
