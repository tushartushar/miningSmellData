(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client.Symbols,DrawingSymbol,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Tests\TileControlD3DTest\Symbols\Symbols.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DrawingName
