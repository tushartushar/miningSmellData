Unnecessary Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,GfxBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\Symbols.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,BitmapGfx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\Symbols.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BitmapIndex
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dwarrowdelf.Client,DrawingGfx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\Symbols.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DrawingName
Feature Envy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,TileSetLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\TileSetLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateCharDrawing which is more interested in members of the type: SymbolSet
Unexploited Encapsulation,Dwarrowdelf.Client,TileSetLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\TileSetLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: VectorGfxBase' BitmapGfx (in method "GetTileBitmap" of class "TileSetLoader").
Unexploited Encapsulation,Dwarrowdelf.Client,TileSetLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\TileSetLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: CharGfx' DrawingGfx (in method "GetVectorGfx" of class "TileSetLoader").
Broken Modularization,Dwarrowdelf.Client,CharGfx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\TileSetGen\Symbols.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Char' Outline' OutlineThickness' FontFamily' FontSize' Color' Background' Reverse' Mode
