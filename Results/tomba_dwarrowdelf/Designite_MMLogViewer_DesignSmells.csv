Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,MemoryMappedLog,RulesWindow,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\RulesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InitializeComponent
Unnecessary Abstraction,MemoryMappedLog,StrLogRule,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\RulesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Component' Thread' Message' Color' Gag
Unnecessary Abstraction,MemoryMappedLog,LogRule,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Component' Thread' Message' Brush' Gag
Unutilized Abstraction,MemoryMappedLog,RegexValidationRule,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MemoryMappedLog,TimeDiffToStringConverter,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MemoryMappedLog.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' MainWindowPlacement' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MemoryMappedLog,MainWindow,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_showOnlyRegex
Broken Modularization,MemoryMappedLog,StrLogRule,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\RulesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Component' Thread' Message' Color' Gag
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MemoryMappedLog,MainWindow,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MemoryMappedLog.MainWindow' MemoryMappedLog.LogEntryToBgBrushConverter
Broken Modularization,MemoryMappedLog,LogRule,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Component' Thread' Message' Brush' Gag
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MemoryMappedLog,LogEntryToBgBrushConverter,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\MemoryMappedLog\MMLogViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MemoryMappedLog.LogEntryToBgBrushConverter' MemoryMappedLog.MainWindow
