Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,TerrainGenTest,POINT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Tests\TerrainGenTest\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y
Unutilized Abstraction,TerrainGenTest,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Tests\TerrainGenTest\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TerrainGenTest,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Tests\TerrainGenTest\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdatePos which is more interested in members of the type: IntSize3
Unnecessary Abstraction,TerrainGenTest.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Tests\TerrainGenTest\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,TerrainGenTest,POINT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Tests\TerrainGenTest\Win32.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
