Cyclic Hierarchy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ContainerObject,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\World\ContainerObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MovableObject
Broken Hierarchy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,ContainerObject,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\World\ContainerObject.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Dwarrowdelf.Client.BaseObject' Dwarrowdelf.IContainerObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dwarrowdelf.Client,EnvironmentObject,C:\repos\tomba_dwarrowdelf\Client\World\EnvironmentObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetProperty
