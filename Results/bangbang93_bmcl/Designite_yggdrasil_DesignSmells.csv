Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,yggdrasil,Agent,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\Agent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MINECRAFT' SCROLLS
Deficient Encapsulation,yggdrasil,Agent,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\Agent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MINECRAFT' SCROLLS
Deficient Encapsulation,yggdrasil,LoginInfo,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\NewLogin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UN' UID' SID' Suc' Errinfo' OtherInfo' Client_identifier
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,yggdrasil,AuthenticationRequest,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\AuthenticationRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: yggdrasil.AuthenticationRequest' yggdrasil.NewLogin
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,yggdrasil,NewLogin,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\NewLogin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: yggdrasil.NewLogin' yggdrasil.AuthenticationRequest
Broken Modularization,yggdrasil,LoginInfo,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\NewLogin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UN' UID' SID' Suc' Errinfo' OtherInfo' Client_identifier
Broken Hierarchy,yggdrasil,AuthenticationResponse,C:\repos\bangbang93_bmcl\yggdrasil\AuthenticationResponse.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): yggdrasil.Response
