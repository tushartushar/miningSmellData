Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.55  All the dependencies among components: from: examples' to: kafka4net' from: examples' to: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Metadata' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Protocols' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Tracing' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Internal' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Responses' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Utils' from: kafka4net' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Requests' from: kafka4net.Compression' to: kafka4net.Utils' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net.Metadata' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net.Protocols' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Responses' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net.Tracing' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Requests' from: kafka4net.ConsumerImpl' to: kafka4net.Internal' from: kafka4net.Internal' to: kafka4net' from: kafka4net.Internal' to: kafka4net.Protocols' from: kafka4net.Internal' to: kafka4net.Metadata' from: kafka4net.Internal' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Responses' from: kafka4net.Internal' to: kafka4net.Tracing' from: kafka4net.Internal' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Requests' from: kafka4net.Metadata' to: kafka4net' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net.Tracing' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net.Utils' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Responses' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net.Metadata' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net.Protocols.Requests' from: kafka4net.Protocols' to: kafka4net.Compression' from: kafka4net.Protocols.Requests' to: kafka4net' from: kafka4net.Protocols.Requests' to: kafka4net.Metadata' from: kafka4net.Protocols.Responses' to: kafka4net.Metadata' from: kafka4net.Utils' to: kafka4net.
