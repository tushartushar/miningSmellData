(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.Wpf.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerException,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WPF\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.Wpf.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerProxy,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WPF\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.Wpf.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerControl,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WPF\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.Wpf.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerParams,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WPF\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' window' streamStartedCallback' streamStoppedCallback' streamFailedCallback
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.Wpf.StreamPlayerControl,RECT,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WPF\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\VideoWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' left' top' right' bottom
