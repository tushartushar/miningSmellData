Unutilized Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,StreamFailedEventArgs,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamFailedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerException,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerProxy,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerControl,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,StreamPlayerParams,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' window' streamStartedCallback' streamStoppedCallback' streamFailedCallback
Deficient Encapsulation,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,BITMAPINFOHEADER,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: biSize' biWidth' biHeight' biPlanes' biBitCount' biCompression' biSizeImage' biXPelsPerMeter' biYPelsPerMeter' biClrUsed' biClrImportant
Broken Modularization,WebEye.Controls.WinForms.StreamPlayerControl,BITMAPINFOHEADER,C:\repos\jacobbo_WebEye\StreamPlayerControl\WinForms\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerControl\StreamPlayerProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' biSize' biWidth' biHeight' biPlanes' biBitCount' biCompression' biSizeImage' biXPelsPerMeter' biYPelsPerMeter' biClrUsed' biClrImportant
