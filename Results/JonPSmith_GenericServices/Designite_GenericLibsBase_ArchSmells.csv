Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.92  All the dependencies among components: from: GenericLibsBase.Core' to: GenericLibsBase' from: GenericServices.Core' to: GenericServices' from: GenericServices.Core' to:
