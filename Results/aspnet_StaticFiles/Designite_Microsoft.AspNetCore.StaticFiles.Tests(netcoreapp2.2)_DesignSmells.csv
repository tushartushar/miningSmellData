Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles,CacheHeaderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_StaticFiles\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles.Tests\CacheHeaderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
