Unutilized Abstraction,DukptNet.Test,DukptBackwardsCompatibilityTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\DukptBackwardsCompatibilityTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DukptNet.Test,DukptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\DukptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DukptNet.Test.Extensions,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\Extensions\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DukptNet.Test,DukptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\DukptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _ksn' _bdk' _clearData' _expectedEncryptedHexPEK' _expectedEncryptedHexDEK
Deficient Encapsulation,DukptNet.Test,DukptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\DukptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: _ksn' _bdk' _clearData' _expectedEncryptedHexPEK' _expectedEncryptedHexDEK
Insufficient Modularization,DukptNet.Test,DukptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\DukptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DukptNet.Test,DukptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgbj_Dukpt.NET\Dukpt.Test\DukptTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
