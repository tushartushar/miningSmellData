Unutilized Abstraction,MongoMigrations,BsonDocumentExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phoenixwebgroup_DotNetMongoMigrations\src\MongoMigrations\BsonDocumentExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MongoMigrations,ExperimentalAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phoenixwebgroup_DotNetMongoMigrations\src\MongoMigrations\ExperimentalMigration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,MongoMigrations,DatabaseMigrationStatus,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phoenixwebgroup_DotNetMongoMigrations\src\MongoMigrations\DatabaseMigrationStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VersionCollectionName
Deficient Encapsulation,MongoMigrations,MigrationLocator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phoenixwebgroup_DotNetMongoMigrations\src\MongoMigrations\MigrationLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MigrationFilters
Deficient Encapsulation,MongoMigrations,MigrationVersion,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phoenixwebgroup_DotNetMongoMigrations\src\MongoMigrations\MigrationVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Major' Minor' Revision
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MongoMigrations,DatabaseMigrationStatus,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phoenixwebgroup_DotNetMongoMigrations\src\MongoMigrations\DatabaseMigrationStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MongoMigrations.DatabaseMigrationStatus' MongoMigrations.MigrationRunner
