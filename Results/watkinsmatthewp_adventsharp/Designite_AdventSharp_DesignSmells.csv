Unutilized Abstraction,AdventSharp,Extensions,C:\repos\watkinsmatthewp_adventsharp\AdventSharp\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AdventSharp,MainCharacter,C:\repos\watkinsmatthewp_adventsharp\AdventSharp\Models\Objects\Items\Characters\MainCharacter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainCharacter' Place
