Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed,Engine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed.Filter,NBiNameFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Filter\NBiNameFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed.Filter,PropertyFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Filter\PropertyFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed.Result,DetailledResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Result\DetailledResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsSuccess' Message
Unutilized Abstraction,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed.Result,FlatResultBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Result\FlatResultBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed.Result,ScoreResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Result\ScoreResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Score' Threshold
Unexploited Encapsulation,NBi.NUnit.Runtime,TestSuite,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\TestSuite.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IGroupCommand' IGroupCommand (in method "ExecuteSetup" of class "TestSuite").
Broken Modularization,NBi.NUnit.Runtime,NBiSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Configuration\NBiSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestSuiteFilename' SettingsFilename' EnableAutoCategories' AllowDtdProcessing' EnableGroupAsCategory' FailureReportProfile' Extensions' Variables
Rebellious Hierarchy,NBi.NUnit.Runtime,NullConfigurationProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\NullConfigurationProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetSection
Rebellious Hierarchy,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Configuration,VariableCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Configuration\VariableCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateNewElement' CreateNewElement' GetElementKey' BaseAdd
Rebellious Hierarchy,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Configuration,ExtensionCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Configuration\ExtensionCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateNewElement' CreateNewElement' GetElementKey' BaseAdd
Rebellious Hierarchy,NBi.NUnit.Runtime.Embed.Filter,PropertyFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.NUnit.Runtime\Embed\Filter\PropertyFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
