Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBi.Framework,ITestConfiguration,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\ITestConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FailureReportProfile
Unutilized Abstraction,NBi.Framework.Sampling,SamplersFactory<T>,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\Sampling\SamplersFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension,TableExtended,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Markdown\MarkdownLogExtension\TableExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToMarkdown
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension,Row,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Markdown\MarkdownLogExtension\TableExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Cells
Unnecessary Abstraction,NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension,TableRowExtended,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Markdown\MarkdownLogExtension\TableRowExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Cells' _cells
Unutilized Abstraction,NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension,TableRowExtended,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Markdown\MarkdownLogExtension\TableRowExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,NBi.Framework,IFailureReportProfile,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\IFailureReportProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxSampleItem' ThresholdSampleItem' ExpectedSet' ActualSet' AnalysisSet' Format' Mode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension,TableExtended,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Markdown\MarkdownLogExtension\TableExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension.TableExtended' NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension.MarkdownBuilder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension,MarkdownBuilder,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Markdown\MarkdownLogExtension\TableExtended.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension.MarkdownBuilder' NBi.Framework.Markdown.MarkdownLogExtension.TableExtended
Broken Hierarchy,NBi.Framework.FailureMessage.Json,ItemsMessageJson,C:\repos\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Framework\FailureMessage\Json\ItemsMessageJson.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBi.Framework.FailureMessage.Markdown.ItemsMessageMarkdown
