Broken Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Items,AssemblyXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Items\AssemblyXml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBi.Xml.Items.QueryableXml
Cyclic Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Items.Calculation.Grouping,GroupByXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Items\Calculation\Grouping\GroupByXml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GroupByNone
Wide Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Items.Filters,IPerspectiveFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Items\Filters\IPerspectiveFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: NBi.Xml.Items.RoutineParametersXml' NBi.Xml.Items.RoutinesXml' NBi.Xml.Items.RoutineParameterXml' NBi.Xml.Items.RoutineXml' NBi.Xml.Items.SetsXml' NBi.Xml.Items.SetXml' NBi.Xml.Items.TablesXml' NBi.Xml.Items.TableXml' NBi.Xml.Items.MeasureGroupsXml' NBi.Xml.Items.DimensionsXml' NBi.Xml.Items.DimensionXml' NBi.Xml.Items.MeasureGroupXml
Broken Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Items.Ranges,IntegerRangeXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Items\Ranges\IntegerRangeXml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBi.Xml.Items.Ranges.RangeXml' NBi.Core.Members.Ranges.IIntegerRange
Broken Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Items.Ranges,DateRangeXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Items\Ranges\DateRangeXml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBi.Xml.Items.Ranges.RangeXml' NBi.Core.Members.Ranges.IDateRange
Broken Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Settings,SettingsStandaloneXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Settings\SettingsStandaloneXml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBi.Xml.Settings.SettingsXml
Rebellious Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Systems,ScalarXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Systems\ScalarXml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetAutoCategories
Broken Hierarchy,NBi.Xml.Systems,ResultSetSystemOldXml,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Seddryck_nbi\NBi.Xml\Systems\ResultSetSystemXml.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NBi.Xml.Systems.ResultSetSystemXml
