Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmark,ExtensionMethods,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Benchmark,Program,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Program[854' 883]' Program[934' 963]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmark,Result,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Serializer' TypeName' Elapsed
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmark.Models,IMobileFeedBase,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\Models\Feed.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: group_id' added_date
Insufficient Modularization,Benchmark,Program,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Benchmark,Program,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 179
Wide Hierarchy,Benchmark,IGenericEquality,F:\newReposMay17\kevin-montrose_Jil\Benchmark\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AccessToken' AccountMerge' Answer' Badge' Comment' Error' Event' MobileFeed' MobileUpdateNotice' FlagOption' InboxItem' Info' NetworkUser' Notification' Post' Privilege' Question' QuestionTimeline' Reputation' ReputationHistory' Revision' SearchExcerpt' ShallowUser' SuggestedEdit' Tag' TagScore' TagSynonym' TagWiki' TopTag' User' UserTimeline' WritePermission
