Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,IdentityUserToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\IdentityUserToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LoginProvider' Name' Value
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,IndexChecks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\IndexChecks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,OptionalIndexChecks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\IndexChecks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,MongoIdentityBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\MongoIdentityBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,UserStore<TUser>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\UserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 54 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,UserStore<TUser>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\UserStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,IdentityRole,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\IdentityRole.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB,IdentityUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\g0t4_aspnet-identity-mongo\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB\IdentityUser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
