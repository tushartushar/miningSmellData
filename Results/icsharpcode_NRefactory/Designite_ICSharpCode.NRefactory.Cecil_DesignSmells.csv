Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,DummyAssemblyResolver,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,CecilLoader,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,CecilLoader,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 67 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,CecilLoader,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 257
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,CecilLoader,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem.CecilLoader' ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem.LazyCecilTypeDefinition
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,LazyCecilTypeDefinition,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem.LazyCecilTypeDefinition' ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem.CecilLoader
Rebellious Hierarchy,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,LazyCecilTypeDefinition,C:\repos\icsharpcode_NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Cecil\CecilLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clone
