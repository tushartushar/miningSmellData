Unutilized Abstraction,AutoMoq.Helpers,AutoMoqTestFixture<T>,C:\repos\darrencauthon_AutoMoq\src\AutoMoq\Helpers\AutoMoqTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoMoq.Unity,MockCreationResult,C:\repos\darrencauthon_AutoMoq\src\AutoMoq\Unity\MockCreationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MockObject' ActualObject
