Feature Envy,AutoMoq.TestFixture.Samples.Code,AccountController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\darrencauthon_AutoMoq\src\AutoMoq.TestFixture.Samples\Code\AccountController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ListAllAccounts which is more interested in members of the type: IAccountRepository
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoMoq.TestFixture.Samples.Code,Account,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\darrencauthon_AutoMoq\src\AutoMoq.TestFixture.Samples\Code\AccountController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AccountId' FirstName' LastName
Unutilized Abstraction,AutoMoq.TestFixture.Samples.Tests,AccountControllerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\darrencauthon_AutoMoq\src\AutoMoq.TestFixture.Samples\Tests\AccountControllerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
