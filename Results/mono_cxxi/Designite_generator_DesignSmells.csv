Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,Templates,LibsBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\BaseMembers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Generator' Current' Nested' Libs
Unnecessary Abstraction,Templates,ClassBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\BaseMembers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Generator' Current' Nested' Class
Unnecessary Abstraction,Templates,EnumBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\BaseMembers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Generator' Current' Nested' Enum
Imperative Abstraction,Templates,CSharpClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\CSharp\CSharpClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: TransformText
Imperative Abstraction,Templates,CSharpLibs,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\CSharp\CSharpLibs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: TransformText
Unutilized Abstraction,Templates,ContextExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Templates,CSharpEnum,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\CSharp\CSharpEnum.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: TransformText
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,Option,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.Option' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionContext' NDesk.Options.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,Option,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.Option' NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext' NDesk.Options.Option
Broken Hierarchy,Templates,Base,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\Base.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Templates.BaseBase
Broken Hierarchy,Templates,LibsBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\BaseMembers.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Templates.Base' Templates.ITemplate
Broken Hierarchy,Templates,ClassBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_cxxi\src\generator\Templates\BaseMembers.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Templates.Base' Templates.ITemplate
