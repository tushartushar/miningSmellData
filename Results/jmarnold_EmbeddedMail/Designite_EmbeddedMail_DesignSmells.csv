Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EmbeddedMail,CoreExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmarnold_EmbeddedMail\src\EmbeddedMail\CoreExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EmbeddedMail.Handlers,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmarnold_EmbeddedMail\src\EmbeddedMail\Handlers\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,EmbeddedMail,SmtpLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmarnold_EmbeddedMail\src\EmbeddedMail\SmtpLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Level' LogAction
Deficient Encapsulation,EmbeddedMail,SmtpLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmarnold_EmbeddedMail\src\EmbeddedMail\SmtpLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Level' LogAction
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EmbeddedMail.Handlers,SmtpMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jmarnold_EmbeddedMail\src\EmbeddedMail\Handlers\SmtpMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EmbeddedMail.Handlers.SmtpMessage' EmbeddedMail.Handlers.SmtpMessagePart
