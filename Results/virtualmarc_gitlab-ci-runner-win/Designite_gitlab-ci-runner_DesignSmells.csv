Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,gitlab_ci_runner.api,RegisterRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\api\API.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: token' public_key
Unnecessary Abstraction,gitlab_ci_runner.api,CheckForBuild,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\api\API.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: token
Unnecessary Abstraction,gitlab_ci_runner.api,PushBuild,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\api\API.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: id' token' state' trace
Unnecessary Abstraction,gitlab_ci_runner.api,RunnerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\api\API.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: id' token
Imperative Abstraction,gitlab_ci_runner.runner,Build,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\runner\Build.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: run
Imperative Abstraction,gitlab_ci_runner.runner,Runner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\runner\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: run
Feature Envy,gitlab_ci_runner.runner,Runner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\runner\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: pushBuild which is more interested in members of the type: Build
Deficient Encapsulation,gitlab_ci_runner.conf,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\conf\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: url' token
Deficient Encapsulation,gitlab_ci_runner.conf,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\conf\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: url' token
Deficient Encapsulation,gitlab_ci_runner.helper,IniFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\helper\IniFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: path
Deficient Encapsulation,gitlab_ci_runner.runner,Build,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\virtualmarc_gitlab-ci-runner-win\gitlab-ci-runner\runner\Build.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: buildInfo' state
