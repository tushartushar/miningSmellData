This class contains only the following public method: StringToDate
Imperative Abstraction,OpenPop.Mime.Decode,EncodedWord,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Mime\Decode\EncodedWord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Decode
Imperative Abstraction,OpenPop.Mime.Header,RfcMailAddress,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Mime\Header\RfcMailAddress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenPop.Mime,Message,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Mime\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Message' FindFirstMessagePartWithMediaType
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenPop.Mime.Traverse,FindAllMessagePartsWithMediaType,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Mime\Traverse\FindAllMessagePartsWithMediaType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FindAllMessagePartsWithMediaType' Message
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenPop.Mime.Traverse,FindAllMessagePartsWithMediaType,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Mime\Traverse\FindAllMessagePartsWithMediaType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FindAllMessagePartsWithMediaType' Message' FindFirstMessagePartWithMediaType' Message
Insufficient Modularization,OpenPop.Pop3,Pop3Client,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Pop3\Pop3Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OpenPop.Pop3,Pop3Client,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Pop3\Pop3Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,OpenPop.Pop3,Pop3Client,C:\repos\AbbasNaqvi_Projects\aenetmail\OpenPop\Pop3\Pop3Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
