Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Shared,RequiredAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\shared\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,ExtractAPISurface,CodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\CodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WriteEnum which is more interested in members of the type: CodeWriter
Feature Envy,ExtractAPISurface,CodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\CodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WriteMembers which is more interested in members of the type: CodeWriter
Feature Envy,ExtractAPISurface,CodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\CodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WriteTypesByNamespace which is more interested in members of the type: CodeWriter
Unnecessary Abstraction,ExtractAPISurface,CommandLineOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\CommandLineOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' InputAssemblies' ReferenceAssemblies' OutputPath
Unutilized Abstraction,ExtractAPISurface,Utils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ExtractAPISurface,CommandLineOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\CommandLineOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OutputPath
Insufficient Modularization,ExtractAPISurface,CodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Win2D\tools\docs\ExtractAPISurface\CodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
