Duplicate Abstraction,ConnectTheDotsHelper,D2CMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  D2CMessage (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs' [20' 42])' D2CMessage (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs' [65' 87])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ConnectTheDotsHelper,CTDSensor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' message' send
Deficient Encapsulation,ConnectTheDotsHelper,D2CMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: guid' displayname' organization' location' measurename' unitofmeasure' timecreated' value
Deficient Encapsulation,ConnectTheDotsHelper,CTDSensor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: message' send
Deficient Encapsulation,ConnectTheDotsHelper,C2DMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: alerttype' message' guid' displayname' organization' location' measurename' unitofmeasure' timecreated' value
Broken Modularization,ConnectTheDotsHelper,D2CMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guid' displayname' organization' location' measurename' unitofmeasure' timecreated' value
Broken Modularization,ConnectTheDotsHelper,C2DMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\Common\csharp\ConnectTheDotsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' alerttype' message' guid' displayname' organization' location' measurename' unitofmeasure' timecreated' value
Broken Modularization,XamarinSimulatedSensors.Helpers,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\XamarinSimulatedSensors\XamarinSimulatedSensors\XamarinSimulatedSensors\Helpers\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AppSettings' DisplayName' ConnectionString' DisplayNameKey' DisplayNameDefault' ConnectionStringKey' ConnectionStringDefault
Broken Hierarchy,XamarinSimulatedSensors,MyClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\DirectlyConnectedDevices\XamarinSimulatedSensors\XamarinSimulatedSensors\XamarinSimulatedSensors\MyClass.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ConnectTheDotsHelper.ConnectTheDots
