Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.ConnectTheDots.GatewayService,WindowsEventLogger,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\Utils\Logger\EventLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WindowsEventLogger (C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\Utils\Logger\EventLogger.cs' [1' 26])' WindowsService (C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\WindowsService.cs' [1' 26])' ProjectInstaller (C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\ProjectInstaller.cs' [1' 26])

Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.ConnectTheDots.GatewayService,EventLogger,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\Utils\Logger\EventLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance' _syncRoot' _eventLogger
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.ConnectTheDots.GatewayService,ProjectInstaller,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\ProjectInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.ConnectTheDots.GatewayService,WindowsEventLogger,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_connectthedots\Devices\Gateways\GatewayService\WindowsService\Utils\Logger\EventLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush
