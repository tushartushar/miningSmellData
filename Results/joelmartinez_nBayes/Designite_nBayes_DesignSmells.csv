Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,nBayes,Analyzer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Analyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,nBayes,BufferedEnumerable<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\BufferedEnumerable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,nBayes.Optimization,Optimizer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Optimization\Optimizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,nBayes.Optimization,Optimizer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Optimization\Optimizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ExplorationThreshold
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,nBayes,Index,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Index.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: nBayes.Index' nBayes.MemoryIndex
Cyclic Hierarchy,nBayes,Entry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Entry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: StringEntry
Cyclic Hierarchy,nBayes,Index,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Index.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MemoryIndex
Cyclic Hierarchy,nBayes.Optimization,Option,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\joelmartinez_nBayes\nBayes\Optimization\Option.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: NamedOption
