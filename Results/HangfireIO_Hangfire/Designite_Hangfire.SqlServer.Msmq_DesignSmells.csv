Unnecessary Abstraction,MQTools,MQMGMTPROPS,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HangfireIO_Hangfire\src\Hangfire.SqlServer.Msmq\MessageQueueExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' cProp' aPropID' aPropVar' status
