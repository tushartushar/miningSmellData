Unutilized Abstraction,XLabs.Cryptography,MD5,C:\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,XLabs.Cryptography,MD5,C:\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MD5 (C:\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs' [690' 710])' MD5 (C:\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5.cs' [739' 759])
Unutilized Abstraction,XLabs.Cryptography,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\src\Cryptography\XLabs.Cryptography\MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
