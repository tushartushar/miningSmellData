Duplicate Abstraction,XLabs.Caching.NUnit.UWP,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\tests\Caching\XLabs.Caching.NUnit.UWP\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  App (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\tests\Caching\XLabs.Caching.NUnit.UWP\App.xaml.cs' [1' 22])' MainPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\tests\Caching\XLabs.Caching.NUnit.UWP\MainPage.xaml.cs' [1' 22])
Unutilized Abstraction,XLabs.Caching.SQLiteTests,BlobSerializerExtensionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\tests\Caching\XLabs.Caching.NUnit.Shared\BlobSerializerExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,XLabs.Caching.SQLiteTests,dataClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\XForms_Xamarin-Forms-Labs\tests\Caching\XLabs.Caching.NUnit.Shared\BlobSerializerExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
