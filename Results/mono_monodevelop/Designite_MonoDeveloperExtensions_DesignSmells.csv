Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MonoMakefile (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefile.cs' [3' 28])' Commands (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\Commands.cs' [3' 28])
Unutilized Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,Commands,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\Commands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefileSolutionExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileSolutionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MonoMakefileSolutionExtension (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileSolutionExtension.cs' [3' 27])' MonoMakefileProjectReader (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileProjectReader.cs' [3' 27])
Duplicate Abstraction,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefileProjectExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileProjectExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MonoMakefileProjectExtension (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileProjectExtension.cs' [8' 28])' MonoMakefileProjectReader (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileProjectReader.cs' [8' 28])
Deficient Encapsulation,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MonoConfigurations
Deficient Encapsulation,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefile,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MonoConfigurations
Unfactored Hierarchy,MonoDeveloper,MonoMakefileSolutionExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileSolutionExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  MonoMakefileSolutionExtension (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileSolutionExtension.cs' [8' 27])' MonoMakefileProjectExtension (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\src\addins\MonoDeveloperExtensions\MonoMakefileProjectExtension.cs' [8' 27])
