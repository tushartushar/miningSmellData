Unutilized Abstraction,ResourcesTester,Form2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Subfolder\FormFile2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Duplicate Abstraction,ResourcesTesterNamespace,Normal,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Normal.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Normal (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Normal.Designer.cs' [43' 64])' Resources (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs' [43' 64])' Normal2 (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Subfolder\Normal2.Designer.cs' [43' 64])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ResourcesTesterNamespace.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,ResourcesTesterNamespace.Subfolder,Normal2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\resources-tester\ResourcesTester\Subfolder\Normal2.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
