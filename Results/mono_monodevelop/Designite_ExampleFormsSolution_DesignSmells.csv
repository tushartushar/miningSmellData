Unnecessary Abstraction,ExampleFormsSolution.Models,Item,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\Models\Item.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Text' Description
Unutilized Abstraction,ExampleFormsSolution.Views,AboutPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\Views\AboutPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExampleFormsSolution.Views,ItemsPage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\Views\ItemsPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ExampleFormsSolution,App,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AzureBackendUrl' UseMockDataStore
Deficient Encapsulation,ExampleFormsSolution,App,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AzureBackendUrl' UseMockDataStore
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ExampleFormsSolution,App,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExampleFormsSolution.App' ExampleFormsSolution.Services.AzureDataStore
Rebellious Hierarchy,ExampleFormsSolution,App,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monodevelop\main\tests\test-projects\performance\ExampleFormsSolution\ExampleFormsSolution\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStart' OnSleep' OnResume
