Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: CityTrafficSimulator' CityTrafficSimulator.Vehicle
Cyclic Dependency,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: CityTrafficSimulator' CityTrafficSimulator.Verkehr
Unstable Dependency,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CityTrafficSimulator.Vehicle' CityTrafficSimulator.Timeline' CityTrafficSimulator.Verkehr
Unstable Dependency,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator.Tools,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CityTrafficSimulator
God Component,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 30
Feature Concentration,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator.Tools,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AlgorithmicGeometry]' [ColorMapControl' ColorMap' ProgramSettings' SerializableColor]' [SortedLinkedList]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
Scattered Functionality,CityTrafficSimulator,CityTrafficSimulator,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: CityTrafficSimulator.Timeline' CityTrafficSimulator.Verkehr
