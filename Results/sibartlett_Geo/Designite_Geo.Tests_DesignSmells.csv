Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.Geomagnetism,GeomagnetismCalculatorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\Geomagnetism\GeomagnetismCalculatorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.Geometries,CircleTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\Geometries\CircleTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests,CoordinateTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\CoordinateTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.IO.Google,GooglePolylineEncoderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\IO\Google\GooglePolylineEncoderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.IO.Wkb,WkbTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\IO\Wkb\WkbTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.IO.Wkt,WktWriterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\IO\Wkt\WktWriterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.IO.Wkt,WktReaderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\IO\Wkt\WktReaderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Geo.Tests.Geodesy,SpheroidCalculatorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\Geodesy\SpheroidCalculatorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unnecessary Abstraction,Geo.Tests.Raven,GeoDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\Raven\RavenTestFixtureBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Geometry' Data1' Data2' Data3
Broken Modularization,Geo.Tests.Raven,GeoDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\Raven\RavenTestFixtureBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Geometry' Data1' Data2' Data3
Broken Hierarchy,Geo.Tests.Raven,RavenTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sibartlett_Geo\Geo.Tests\Raven\RavenTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Geo.Tests.Raven.RavenTestFixtureBase
