Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Moonlight,AddPC,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limelight-stream_limelight-wp\Moonlight\MainPage\AddPC.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Moonlight,PairingManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limelight-stream_limelight-wp\Moonlight\Pairing\PairingManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: QueryPairState which is more interested in members of the type: NvHttp
Unutilized Abstraction,Moonlight,AvStreamSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limelight-stream_limelight-wp\Moonlight\StreamFrame\AvStreamSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Moonlight,StreamFrame,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limelight-stream_limelight-wp\Moonlight\StreamFrame\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Moonlight,KeyboardHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limelight-stream_limelight-wp\Moonlight\StreamFrame\KeyboardHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Moonlight.Controllers,XInput,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limelight-stream_limelight-wp\Moonlight\Controllers\XInput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
