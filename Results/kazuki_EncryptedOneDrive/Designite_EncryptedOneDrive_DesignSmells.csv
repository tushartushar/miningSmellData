Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive,OldFileSystem,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OldFileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Unutilized Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive,OldFileSystem,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OldFileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive,OldFileSystem,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OldFileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: OldFileSystem[381' 405]' FileSystem[985' 1009]
Multifaceted Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive,OldOneDriveClient,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OldOneDriveClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.8
Multifaceted Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive,FileSystem,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\FileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Duplicate Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive,FileSystem,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\FileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: EncryptedOneDrive.FileSystem' EncryptedOneDrive.OneDrive.FileSystem
Unutilized Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive.Security,IAuthenticatedCryptoTransform,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\Security\IAuthenticatedCryptoTransform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive.OneDrive,UploadResult,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OneDrive\UploadResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Source
Duplicate Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive.OneDrive,UploadResult,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OneDrive\UploadResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: UploadResult[1' 20]' ObjectProperty[1' 20]' FileListResult[1' 20]' QuotaResponse[1' 20]
Unnecessary Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive.OneDrive,FileListResult,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OneDrive\FileListResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data
Unnecessary Abstraction,EncryptedOneDrive.OneDrive,QuotaResponse,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OneDrive\QuotaResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Available' Quota
Insufficient Modularization,EncryptedOneDrive,FileSystem,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\FileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 145
Broken Modularization,EncryptedOneDrive.OneDrive,ObjectProperty,C:\repos\kazuki_EncryptedOneDrive\EncryptedOneDrive\OneDrive\ObjectProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Description' ParentID' Size' ObjectType' CreatedTime' UpdatedTime' IsFile' IsFolder
