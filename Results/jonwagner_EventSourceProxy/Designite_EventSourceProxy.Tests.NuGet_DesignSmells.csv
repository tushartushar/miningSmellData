Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,EventSourceProxy.NuGet.Tests,NuGetTypeTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_EventSourceProxy\EventSourceProxy.Tests.NuGet\NuGetTypeTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AbstractClassWithExternalEnumsCanBeImplemented which is more interested in members of the type: TestEventListener
Broken Hierarchy,EventSourceProxy.NuGet.Tests,NuGetTypeTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_EventSourceProxy\EventSourceProxy.Tests.NuGet\NuGetTypeTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EventSourceProxy.NuGet.Tests.BaseLoggingTest
