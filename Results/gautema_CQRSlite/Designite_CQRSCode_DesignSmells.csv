Unnecessary Abstraction,CQRSCode.ReadModel.Infrastructure,InMemoryDatabase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\ReadModel\Infrastructure\InMemoryDatabase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Details' List
Unnecessary Abstraction,CQRSCode.ReadModel.Queries,GetInventoryItems,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\ReadModel\Queries\GetInventoryItems.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,CQRSCode.WriteModel.Handlers,InventoryCommandHandlers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\WriteModel\Handlers\InventoryCommandHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Handle which is more interested in members of the type: ISession
Feature Envy,CQRSCode.WriteModel.Handlers,InventoryCommandHandlers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\WriteModel\Handlers\InventoryCommandHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Handle which is more interested in members of the type: ISession

Deficient Encapsulation,CQRSCode.ReadModel.Dtos,InventoryItemDetailsDto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\ReadModel\Dtos\InventoryItemDetailsDto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Name' CurrentCount' Version
Deficient Encapsulation,CQRSCode.ReadModel.Dtos,InventoryItemListDto,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\ReadModel\Dtos\InventoryItemListDto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Name
Broken Hierarchy,CQRSCode.WriteModel.Domain,InventoryItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Sample\CQRSCode\WriteModel\Domain\InventoryItem.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CQRSlite.Domain.AggregateRoot
