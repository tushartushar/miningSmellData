Unutilized Abstraction,CQRSlite.Tests.Extensions.TestHelpers,Specification<TAggregate;THandler;TCommand>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Framework\CQRSlite.Tests.Extensions\TestHelpers\Specification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CQRSlite.Tests.Extensions.TestHelpers,ThenAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Framework\CQRSlite.Tests.Extensions\TestHelpers\ThenAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Missing Hierarchy,CQRSlite.Tests.Extensions.TestHelpers,Specification<TAggregate;THandler;TCommand>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gautema_CQRSlite\Framework\CQRSlite.Tests.Extensions\TestHelpers\Specification.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ICancellableCommandHandler' ICommandHandler (in method "Specification" of class "Specification<TAggregate'THandler'TCommand>").
