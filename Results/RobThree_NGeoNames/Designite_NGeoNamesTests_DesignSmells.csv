Unutilized Abstraction,NGeoNamesTests,ComposerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NGeoNames\NGeoNamesTests\ComposerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NGeoNamesTests,CustomEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NGeoNames\NGeoNamesTests\CustomEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data
Unutilized Abstraction,NGeoNamesTests,EntitiesTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NGeoNames\NGeoNamesTests\EntitiesTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NGeoNamesTests,GenericEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NGeoNames\NGeoNamesTests\FileUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Insufficient Modularization,NGeoNamesTests,ParserTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RobThree_NGeoNames\NGeoNamesTests\ParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
