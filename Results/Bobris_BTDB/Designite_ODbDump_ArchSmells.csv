Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.4  All the dependencies among components: from: ODbDump' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer' from: ODbDump' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: ODbDump' to: BTDB.ODBLayer' from: BTDB.ChunkCache' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer' from: BTDB.ChunkCache' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.ChunkCache' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.ChunkedFile' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.DtoChannel' to: BTDB.Service' from: BTDB.DtoChannel' to: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' from: BTDB.DtoChannel' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' to: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' from: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' to: BTDB.FieldHandler' from: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' to: BTDB.ODBLayer' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.FieldHandler' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.ODBLayer' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.SnappyCompression' from: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' to: BTDB.EventStore2Layer' from: BTDB.FieldHandler' to: BTDB.EventStoreLayer' from: BTDB.FieldHandler' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.FieldHandler' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.FieldHandler' to: BTDB.ODBLayer' from: BTDB.FieldHandler' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.IL.Caching' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.IOC' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.IOC' to: BTDB.IOC.CRegs' from: BTDB.IOC.CRegs' to: BTDB.IOC' from: BTDB.IOC.CRegs' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer.BTree' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer.BTree' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer.BTreeMem' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer.BTreeMem' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer.BTree' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer.BTreeMem' from: BTDB.KVDBLayer' to: BTDB.SnappyCompression' from: BTDB.ODBLayer' to: BTDB.KVDBLayer' from: BTDB.ODBLayer' to: BTDB.FieldHandler' from: BTDB.ODBLayer' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.ODBLayer' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.ODBLayer' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.Service' to: BTDB.FieldHandler' from: BTDB.Service' to: BTDB.StreamLayer' from: BTDB.Service' to: BTDB.IL' from: BTDB.Service' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.Service' to: BTDB.ODBLayer' from: BTDB.SnappyCompression' to: BTDB.Buffer' from: BTDB.StreamLayer' to: BTDB.Buffer.
