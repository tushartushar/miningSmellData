Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,EloEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,ZKAccount,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\DuplicateFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AccountID' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,WikiPortingMW,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\WikiPortingMW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fileDir
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,WikiPortingMW,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\WikiPortingMW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: fileDir
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,MiniBat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ID' Duration' MapID' Players
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,EloEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
