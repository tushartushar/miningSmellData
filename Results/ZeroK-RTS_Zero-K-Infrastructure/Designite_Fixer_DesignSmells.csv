Unnecessary Abstraction,Fixer,MiniBat,C:\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ID' Duration' MapID' Players
Unnecessary Abstraction,Fixer,EloEntry,C:\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Elo' Cnt
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,BattleBalanceData,C:\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\BattleBalanceData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAX_TEAMSIZE
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,BattleBalanceData,C:\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\BattleBalanceData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MAX_TEAMSIZE
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,ZKAccount,C:\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\DuplicateFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AccountID' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,WikiPortingMW,C:\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\WikiPortingMW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fileDir
