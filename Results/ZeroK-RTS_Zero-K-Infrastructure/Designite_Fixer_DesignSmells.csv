Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,BattleBalanceData,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\BattleBalanceData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,DuplicateFinder,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\DuplicateFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,NubSimulator,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\NubSimulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,WikiPortingMW,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\WikiPortingMW.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,WikiPorting,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\WikiPorting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,PlanetwarsFixer,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\PlanetwarsFixer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Fixer,PlanetwarsFixer,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\PlanetwarsFixer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PlanetwarsFixer[1' 23]' ForumFixer[1' 23]
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixer,ForumFixer,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\ForumFixer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,BattleBalanceData,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\BattleBalanceData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAX_TEAMSIZE
Deficient Encapsulation,Fixer,BattleBalanceData,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\BattleBalanceData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MAX_TEAMSIZE
Insufficient Modularization,Fixer,Program,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Fixer,Program,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Fixer,Program,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Fixer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
