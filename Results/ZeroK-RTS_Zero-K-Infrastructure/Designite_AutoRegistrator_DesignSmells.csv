Unutilized Abstraction,ZeroKWeb,AutoRegistrator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\AutoRegistrator\AutoRegistrator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ZeroKWeb,AutoRegistrator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\AutoRegistrator\AutoRegistrator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadAllSpringFeatures which is more interested in members of the type: PlasmaDownloader
Imperative Abstraction,AutoRegistrator,SteamDepotGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\AutoRegistrator\SteamDepotGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RunAll
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoRegistrator,DummyProgress,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\AutoRegistrator\SteamDepotGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Download' Status
Deficient Encapsulation,ZeroKWeb,AutoRegistrator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\AutoRegistrator\AutoRegistrator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Downloader' Paths' UnitSyncer
