Unutilized Abstraction,PlanetWarsReplayCreator,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Gif.Components,GifDecoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\NGif\GifDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Gif.Components,NeuQuant,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\NGif\NeuQuant.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NeuQuant (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\NGif\NeuQuant.cs' [327' 346])' NeuQuant (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\NGif\NeuQuant.cs' [356' 375])
Unnecessary Abstraction,PlanetWarsReplayCreator.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Gif.Components,GifFrame,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWarsReplayCreator\NGif\GifDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: image' delay
