Imperative Abstraction,LuaAdmin,AddImageForm,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\AddImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateThumbNail
Duplicate Abstraction,LuaAdmin,AddImageForm,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\AddImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AddImageForm[146' 174]' LuaFileUploadDlg[119' 147]
Unutilized Abstraction,LuaAdmin,WidgetAdmin,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\WidgetAdmin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LuaAdmin.Properties,Settings,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,LuaAdmin,Program,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fetcher' allLuas' allGames' allCategories' allGameWidgets' allLuaNames' UserId' isSuperAdmin' version
Deficient Encapsulation,LuaAdmin,Program,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: fetcher' allLuas' allGames' allCategories' allGameWidgets' allLuaNames' UserId' isSuperAdmin' version
Insufficient Modularization,LuaAdmin,WidgetAdmin,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\WidgetAdmin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 53 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LuaAdmin,WidgetAdmin,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaAdmin\WidgetAdmin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 124
