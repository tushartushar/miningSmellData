Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,PlanetWarsServer,Entry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\LuaTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Key' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,PlanetWarsServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SpringieStates
Insufficient Modularization,PlanetWarsServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PlanetWarsServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PlanetWarsServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 192
Insufficient Modularization,PlanetWarsServer,ServerProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\ServerProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Broken Modularization,PlanetWarsServer,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' SaveInterval' DefaultServerStatePath' MaxFactionSizeDifference' GalaxyTemplatePath' MetalForVictory' MetalForDefeat' MetalForPlanetOwnedFree' MetalForPlanetOwnedOccupied' TotalMetalForFactionPlanets' MetalForPlanetOwnedCloutBonus' defaultInstance
Missing Hierarchy,PlanetWarsServer,LuaTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\PlanetWars.old\PlanetWarsServer\LuaTable.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: LuaTable' LuaTable (in method "ToString" of class "LuaTable").
