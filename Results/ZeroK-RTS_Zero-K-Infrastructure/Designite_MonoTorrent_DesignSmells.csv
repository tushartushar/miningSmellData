Unexploited Encapsulation,MonoTorrent.Common,Torrent,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Common\Torrent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BEncodedString' BEncodedList (in method "LoadInternal" of class "Torrent").
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent.Common,MyHttpUtility,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MyHttpUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent.Common,BitField,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Common\BitField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent.Common,Torrent,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Common\Torrent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent.Client.Messages,Message,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.BEncoding\BEncodedString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoTorrent.Client,Block,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Client\Block.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Block' Piece
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent,Check,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Common\Check.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoTorrent,Check,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Common\Check.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Missing Hierarchy,MonoTorrent.Common,Torrent,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\Shared\MonoTorrent\MonoTorrent.Common\Torrent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: BEncodedString' BEncodingException (in method "LoadInternal" of class "Torrent").
