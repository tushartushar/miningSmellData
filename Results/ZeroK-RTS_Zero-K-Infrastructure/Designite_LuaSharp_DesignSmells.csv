Duplicate Abstraction,LuaSharp,Lua,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaSharp\LuaSharp\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Lua[3' 26]' LuaException[3' 26]' Helpers[3' 26]' Extensions[3' 26]' LuaFunction[3' 26]' LuaTable[3' 26]' LuaTable[29' 52]
Unutilized Abstraction,LuaSharp,LuaException,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaSharp\LuaSharp\LuaException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LuaSharp,Helpers,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaSharp\LuaSharp\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Helpers' LuaTable
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LuaSharp,LuaFunction,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaSharp\LuaSharp\LuaFunction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LuaFunction' Helpers
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LuaSharp,LuaFunction,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaSharp\LuaSharp\LuaFunction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Missing Hierarchy,LuaSharp,Helpers,D:\newReposJune17\ZeroK-RTS_Zero-K-Infrastructure\LuaAdmin\LuaSharp\LuaSharp\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: LuaFunction' LuaTable (in method "Push" of class "Helpers").
