Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Main which is more interested in members of the type: AriClient
Feature Envy,SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: c_OnStasisEndEvent which is more interested in members of the type: AriClient
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync,RecordingToChannel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Recording' Channel
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: actionClient' endPoint' recording
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleRecordAndPlaybackAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: actionClient' endPoint' recording
