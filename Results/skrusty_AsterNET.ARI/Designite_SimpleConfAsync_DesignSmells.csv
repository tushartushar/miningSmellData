Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleConfAsync,AppConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AppName' RestAddress
Feature Envy,SimpleConfAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunDemo which is more interested in members of the type: AriClient
Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleConfAsync.Helpers,SyncHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Helpers\SyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleConfAsync.REST,ConferenceController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\REST\ConferenceController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Conference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Conferences' Confbridge' ConferenceName' ConferenceUsers' Id
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Conference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Conferences
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,ConferenceUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\ConferenceUser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Channel
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Client
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleConfAsync,Conference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimpleConfAsync.Conference' SimpleConfAsync.ConferenceUser
