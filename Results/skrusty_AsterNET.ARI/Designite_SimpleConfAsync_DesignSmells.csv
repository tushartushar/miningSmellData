Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleConfAsync,AppConfig,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AppName' RestAddress
Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleConfAsync.Helpers,SyncHelper,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Helpers\SyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleConfAsync.REST,ConferenceController,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\REST\ConferenceController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Conference,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Conferences' Confbridge' ConferenceName' ConferenceUsers' Id
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Conference,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Conferences
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,ConferenceUser,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\ConferenceUser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Channel
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Program,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Client
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleConfAsync,Program,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleConfAsync,Conference,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\AsyncSamples\SimpleConfAsync\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Conference' ConferenceUser
