Unnecessary Abstraction,AsterNET.ARI.SimpleConfExample,AppConfig,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\Samples\SimpleConfExample\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AppName' RestAddress
Unutilized Abstraction,AsterNET.ARI.SimpleConfExample.Helpers,SyncHelper,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\Samples\SimpleConfExample\Helpers\SyncHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AsterNET.ARI.SimpleConfExample.REST,ConferenceController,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\Samples\SimpleConfExample\REST\ConferenceController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AsterNET.ARI.SimpleConfExample.REST,Startup,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\Samples\SimpleConfExample\REST\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AsterNET.ARI.SimpleConfExample,Conference,C:\repos\skrusty_AsterNET.ARI\Samples\SimpleConfExample\Conference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
