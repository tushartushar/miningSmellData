Unutilized Abstraction,Ducksboard.Tests,ClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_Ducksboard\Ducksboard.Tests\ClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Feature Envy,Ducksboard.Tests,DashboardTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_Ducksboard\Ducksboard.Tests\DashboardTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_create_read_update_delete_dashboard which is more interested in members of the type: DashboardClient
