Unnecessary Abstraction,SEConfigTool.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SEModCommunity_SE-Community-Mod-API\SEConfigTool\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,SEConfigTool,SEConfigTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SEModCommunity_SE-Community-Mod-API\SEConfigTool\SEConfigTool.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: CubeBlockEntity' CargoContainerEntity' MedicalRoomEntity' InventoryItemEntity' GravityGeneratorEntity' VoxelMap' Meteor (in method "TRV_SavedGame_Objects_AfterSelect" of class "SEConfigTool").
Unexploited Encapsulation,SEConfigTool,SEConfigTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SEModCommunity_SE-Community-Mod-API\SEConfigTool\SEConfigTool.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ReactorEntity' CockpitEntity' CubeGridEntity (in method "TRV_SavedGame_Objects_AfterSelect" of class "SEConfigTool").
Unexploited Encapsulation,SEConfigTool,SEConfigTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SEModCommunity_SE-Community-Mod-API\SEConfigTool\SEConfigTool.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BeaconEntity' FloatingObject (in method "TRV_SavedGame_Objects_AfterSelect" of class "SEConfigTool").
Insufficient Modularization,SEConfigTool,SEConfigTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SEModCommunity_SE-Community-Mod-API\SEConfigTool\SEConfigTool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 148 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SEConfigTool,SEConfigTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SEModCommunity_SE-Community-Mod-API\SEConfigTool\SEConfigTool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 339
