Unnecessary Abstraction,XsaLib,MechAttenLimit,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Agilent\XsaCore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MAX' MIN
Unutilized Abstraction,XsaLib,MechAttenLimit,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Agilent\XsaCore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,XsaLib,Instrument,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\Instrument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IDN
Insufficient Modularization,XsaLib,Instrument,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\Instrument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XsaLib,Mode,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Modes\Mode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mode' XsaCore' SpectrumAnalyzer' XsaCore
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XsaLib,Mode,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Modes\Mode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mode' XsaCore' SpectrumAnalyzer' XsaCore' Measurement
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XsaLib,SpectrumAnalyzer,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Modes\SpectrumAnalyzer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SpectrumAnalyzer' XsaCore
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XsaLib,WCDMA,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Modes\WCDMA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WCDMA' XsaCore
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XsaLib,WCDMA,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Modes\WCDMA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WCDMA' XsaCore' Mode' XsaCore
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XsaLib,WCDMA,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Modes\WCDMA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WCDMA' XsaCore' Measurement' Mode' XsaCore
Broken Hierarchy,XsaLib,EXA,C:\repos\mtapalla_XsaLib\src\SignalAnalyzers\Agilent\EXA.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XsaCore
