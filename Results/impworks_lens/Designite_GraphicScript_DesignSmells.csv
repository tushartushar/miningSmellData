Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphicScript,BoolToVisibilityConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\BoolToVisibilityConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphicScript,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,GraphicScript.Objects,Figure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\Objects\Figure.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Unregister which is more interested in members of the type: FigureManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphicScript.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\obj\x86\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphicScript.Objects,Circle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\Objects\Circle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Radius
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphicScript.Objects,Figure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\Objects\Figure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Fill' Outline' Thickness' Update' Focus' Blur' Click
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphicScript.Objects,Rect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\Objects\Rect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Width' Height
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GraphicScript.Objects,Figure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\impworks_lens\GraphicScript\Objects\Figure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphicScript.Objects.Figure' GraphicScript.Objects.FigureManager
