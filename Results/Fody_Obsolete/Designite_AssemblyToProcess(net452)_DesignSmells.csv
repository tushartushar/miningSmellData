Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Before,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Before,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Before,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Before.ClassToMark' AfterVersion1.ClassToMark' AfterVersion3.ClassToMark
Unnecessary Abstraction,AfterVersion1,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AfterVersion1,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AfterVersion3,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AfterVersion3,ClassToMark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Obsolete\AssemblyToProcess\Sample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
