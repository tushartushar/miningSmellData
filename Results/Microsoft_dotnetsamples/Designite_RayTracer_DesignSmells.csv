Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RayTracer,MainWindow,C:\repos\Microsoft_dotnetsamples\System.Numerics\SIMD\RayTracer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,RayTracer,Intersection,C:\repos\Microsoft_dotnetsamples\System.Numerics\SIMD\RayTracer\Intersection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ObjectHit
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RayTracer,Intersection,C:\repos\Microsoft_dotnetsamples\System.Numerics\SIMD\RayTracer\Intersection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RayTracer.Intersection' RayTracer.Objects.DrawableSceneObject
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RayTracer.Objects,DrawableSceneObject,C:\repos\Microsoft_dotnetsamples\System.Numerics\SIMD\RayTracer\Objects\DrawableSceneObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RayTracer.Objects.DrawableSceneObject' RayTracer.Intersection
