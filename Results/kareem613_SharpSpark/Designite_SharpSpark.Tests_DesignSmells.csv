Unutilized Abstraction,Maybe5.SharpSpark.Tests,SparkClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kareem613_SharpSpark\SharpSpark.Tests\SparkClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Maybe5.SharpSpark.Tests,SparkClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kareem613_SharpSpark\SharpSpark.Tests\SparkClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GivenClientInfoExpectDeviceInfo which is more interested in members of the type: SparkClient
