Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EasyMotion,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyMotion,GuidList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidEasyMotionPkgString' guidEasyMotionCmdSetString' guidEasyMotionCmdSet
Unutilized Abstraction,EasyMotion,EasyMotionPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\EasyMotionPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyMotion,PkgCmdIDList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\PkgCmdID.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CmdEasyMotionNavigate
Feature Envy,EasyMotion.Implementation.Adornment,EasyMotionAdornmentController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\Implementation\Adornment\EasyMotionAdornmentController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnLayoutChanged which is more interested in members of the type: IEasyMotionUtil
Unutilized Abstraction,EasyMotion.Implementation.KeyProcessing,EasyMotionKeyProcessorProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\Implementation\KeyProcessing\EasyMotionKeyProcessorProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EasyMotion.Implementation.Margin,EasyMotionMarginController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EasyMotion\EasyMotion\Implementation\Margin\EasyMotionMarginController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EasyMotion.Implementation.Margin.EasyMotionMarginController' EasyMotion.Implementation.Margin.EasyMotionMarginProvider
