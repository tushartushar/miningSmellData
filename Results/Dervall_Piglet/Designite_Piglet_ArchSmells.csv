Unstable Dependency,Piglet,Piglet.Lexer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Piglet.Lexer.Configuration' Piglet.Parser.Configuration' Piglet.Parser.Construction
