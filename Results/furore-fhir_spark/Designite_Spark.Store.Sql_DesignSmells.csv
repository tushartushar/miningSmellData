Unutilized Abstraction,Spark.Store.Sql,IServiceProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\IServiceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Spark.Store.Sql,SqlScopedSnapshotStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\SqlScopedSnapshotStore.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddSnapshot which is more interested in members of the type: IFhirDbContext

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' ResourceKey' BundleSnapshotId' BundleSnapshot
Unnecessary Abstraction,Spark.Store.Sql.StoreExtensions,IFhirStoreScopedExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\StoreExtensions\IFhirStoreScopedExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Scope
Broken Modularization,Spark.Store.Sql.Model,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\Model\Resource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Endpoint' ResourceType' ResourceId' ScopeKey' CreationDate' ResourceVersions
Broken Modularization,Spark.Store.Sql.Model,BundleSnapshot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\Model\BundleSnapshot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Key' Count' BundleType' Uri' Resources
Broken Modularization,Spark.Store.Sql.Model,ResourceContent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\Model\ResourceContent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' ResourceId' Resource' Method' InternalVersionId' Content' CreationDate
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spark.Store.Sql.Model,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\Model\Resource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Spark.Store.Sql.Model.Resource' Spark.Store.Sql.Model.ResourceContent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spark.Store.Sql.Model,BundleSnapshot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\Model\BundleSnapshot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Spark.Store.Sql.Model.BundleSnapshot' Spark.Store.Sql.Model.BundleSnapshotResource
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Store.Sql,CustomResourceStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\CustomResourceStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdateResource' UpdateResourceContent
Rebellious Hierarchy,Spark.Store.Sql,SqlScopedIndexStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\furore-fhir_spark\src\Spark.Store.Sql\SqlScopedIndexStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Save' Delete' Clean
