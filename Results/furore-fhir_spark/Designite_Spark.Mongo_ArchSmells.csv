Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Spark.Mongo,Spark.Mongo.Search.Common,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Spark.Mongo.Search.Common' Spark.Search.Mongo
Unstable Dependency,Spark.Mongo,Spark.Mongo.Search.Common,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Spark.Search.Mongo' Spark.Mongo.Search.Indexer
Feature Concentration,Spark.Mongo,Spark.Store.Mongo,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MongoDatabaseFactory' MongoFhirStore' MongoFhirStoreOther' SparkBsonHelper' Field' Value' MongoTransaction' Collection]' [Hack]' [IncludeParameter]' [MongoIncluder].
