Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,CancelAfterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\CancelAfterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,CancelAfterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\CancelAfterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CancelAfterTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\CancelAfterTests.cs' [90' 113])' CancelAfterTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\CancelAfterTests.cs' [124' 147])
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,ContinueWithTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\ContinueWithTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,DelayTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\DelayTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,SyncContextTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\SyncContextTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,WhenAllTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\WhenAllTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AsyncBridge.Tests,WhenAnyTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\WhenAnyTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,AsyncBridge.Tests,ContinueWithTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\ContinueWithTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AsyncBridge.Tests,ContinueWithTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\tests\AsyncBridge.Tests\ContinueWithTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
