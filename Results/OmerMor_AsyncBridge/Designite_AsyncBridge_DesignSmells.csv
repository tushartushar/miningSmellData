Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,IteratorStateMachineAttribute,C:\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\src\AsyncBridge\Runtime.CompilerServices\IteratorStateMachineAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,StateMachineAttribute,C:\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\src\AsyncBridge\Runtime.CompilerServices\StateMachineAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,VoidTaskResult,C:\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\src\AsyncBridge\Runtime.CompilerServices\VoidTaskResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,VoidTaskResult,C:\repos\OmerMor_AsyncBridge\src\AsyncBridge\Runtime.CompilerServices\VoidTaskResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
