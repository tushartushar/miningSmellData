Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,IO,SerialPort,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_io\Serial.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _atnLine
Insufficient Modularization,IO,CIA,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_io\CIA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 131
Rebellious Hierarchy,IO,CIA,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_io\CIA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteToStateFile
Unfactored Hierarchy,IO,CIA,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_io\CIA.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: CIA[1' 31]' SerialPort[1' 31]
