Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Video,Pallete,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Colors' CvtColors
Multifaceted Abstraction,Video,VIC,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Deficient Encapsulation,Video,Pallete,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CvtColors
Deficient Encapsulation,Video,Pallete,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CvtColors
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Video,RasterLine,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RasterLine' VIC
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Video,RasterLine,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RasterLine' VIC' GraphicMode' VIC
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Video,GraphicMode,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GraphicMode' VIC
Insufficient Modularization,Video,VIC,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Video,VIC,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\VIC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Audio,SID,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\SID.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write
Unfactored Hierarchy,Audio,SID,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_av\SID.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: SID[1' 30]' RasterLine[1' 30]
