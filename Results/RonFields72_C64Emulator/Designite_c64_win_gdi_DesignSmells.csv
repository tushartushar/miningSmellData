Multifaceted Abstraction,c64_win_gdi,C64Emulator,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_win_gdi\C64Emulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.84
Duplicate Abstraction,c64_win_gdi,C64Emulator,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_win_gdi\C64Emulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: C64Emulator[1' 28]' File[1' 28]' C64EmuForm[1' 28]' Program[1' 28]
Duplicate Abstraction,c64_win_gdi,C64Emulator,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_win_gdi\C64Emulator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: C64Emulator[1' 30]' C64EmuForm[1' 30]' Program[1' 30]
Unnecessary Abstraction,c64_win_gdi.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_win_gdi\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,c64_win_gdi,File,C:\repos\RonFields72_C64Emulator\c64_win_gdi\Environment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
