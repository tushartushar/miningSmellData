Insufficient Modularization,Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network,BigEndianStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pdelvo_Pdelvo.Minecraft\Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network\BigEndianStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 57 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network,BigEndianStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pdelvo_Pdelvo.Minecraft\Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network\BigEndianStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 57 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network,AsnKeyBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pdelvo_Pdelvo.Minecraft\Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network\ProtocolCryptography.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network,AsnKeyBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pdelvo_Pdelvo.Minecraft\Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network\ProtocolCryptography.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Rebellious Hierarchy,Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network,AesStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pdelvo_Pdelvo.Minecraft\Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network\AesStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek' SetLength
Rebellious Hierarchy,Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network,FullyReadStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pdelvo_Pdelvo.Minecraft\Pdelvo.Minecraft.Network\FullyReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
