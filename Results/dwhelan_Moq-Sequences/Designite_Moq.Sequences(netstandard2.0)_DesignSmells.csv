Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Moq.Sequences,SequenceThreadContextMode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences\SequenceContextMode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ActiveSequence' activeSequence
Unnecessary Abstraction,Moq.Sequences,SequenceAsyncContextMode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences\SequenceContextMode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ActiveSequence' activeSequence
Unutilized Abstraction,Moq.Sequences,SequenceExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences\SequenceExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Moq.Sequences,Sequence,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences\Sequence.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Moq.Sequences.Sequence' Moq.Sequences.SequenceContextMode
Cyclic Hierarchy,Moq.Sequences,SequenceContextMode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences\SequenceContextMode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SequenceThreadContextMode
Cyclic Hierarchy,Moq.Sequences,SequenceContextMode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences\SequenceContextMode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SequenceAsyncContextMode
