Unutilized Abstraction,Moq.Sequences.Tests,AsyncTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\AsyncTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Moq.Sequences.Tests,BlogPresenterTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\BlogPresenterTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Moq.Sequences.Tests,Post,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\BlogPresenterTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DateTime
Unutilized Abstraction,Moq.Sequences.Tests,LoopTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\LoopTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Moq.Sequences.Tests,SequenceTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\SequenceTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Moq.Sequences.Tests,StepTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\StepTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Moq.Sequences.Tests,SequenceTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwhelan_Moq-Sequences\src\Moq.Sequences.Tests\SequenceTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
