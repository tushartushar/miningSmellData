Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NeuQuant,PeptideSpectrumMatchScoreType,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\PeptideSpectrumMatchScoreType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,NeuQuant.IO,NeuQuantFile,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Duplicate Abstraction,NeuQuant.IO,NeuQuantFile,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: NeuQuantFile[445' 464]' NeuQuantFile[470' 489]
Multifaceted Abstraction,NeuQuant.Processing,Processor,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\Processing\T1 Processor Construction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Deficient Encapsulation,NeuQuant,NeuQuantPeptide,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantPeptide.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PeptideSpectrumMatches' BestPeptideSpectrumMatch' IdentifiedChargeStates' QuantifiableChannels' Clusters' FeatureSets
Deficient Encapsulation,NeuQuant,PeptideSpectralMatchFile,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\PeptideSpectralMatchFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UsedRawFiles' FixedModifications' VariableModifications
Deficient Encapsulation,NeuQuant,Reagents,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\Reagents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: K100' K002' K040' K080' K422' K440' K521' K341' K602' R200' R002' K8Plex2' K8Plex3' K8SilacPlex2
Deficient Encapsulation,NeuQuant,Reagents,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\Reagents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: K100' K002' K040' K080' K422' K440' K521' K341' K602' R200' R002' K8Plex2' K8Plex3' K8SilacPlex2
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NeuQuant,NeuQuantFeature,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NeuQuantFeature' NeuQuantFeatureSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NeuQuant,NeuQuantFeature,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantFeature.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NeuQuantFeature' NeuQuantFeatureSet' NeuQuantPeptide' NeuQuantFeatureSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NeuQuant,NeuQuantPeptide,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantPeptide.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NeuQuantPeptide' NeuQuantFeatureSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NeuQuant.IO,NeuQuantFile,C:\repos\dbaileychess_NeuQuant\NeuQuant.lib\NeuQuantFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NeuQuantFile' Processor
