Unnecessary Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Caching,IPerRequestCacheProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Caching\IPerRequestCacheProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Caching,IRuntimeCacheProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Caching\IRuntimeCacheProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Data,IEntityConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Data\IEntityConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Dependency,IGenericImportOrder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Dependency\IGenericImportOrder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Order
Unutilized Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Dependency,IGenericImportOrder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Dependency\IGenericImportOrder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Dependency,DeployedAssemblyLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Dependency\InternalDeployedAssemblyLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KeyHub.Core,EntityNotFoundException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\EntityNotFoundException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KeyHub.Core,EntityOperationNotSupportedException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\EntityOperationNotSupportedException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,KeyHub.Core.Kernel,KernelContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Kernel\KernelContext.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunKernelEvents which is more interested in members of the type: ILoggingService
Unnecessary Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.Settings,ISettingsFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Settings\ISettingsFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RootNode' FileName
Unutilized Abstraction,KeyHub.Core.UnitOfWork,IUnitOfWork,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\UnitOfWork\IUnitOfWork.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Wide Hierarchy,KeyHub.Core.Data,IEntityConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_keyhub\src\KeyHub.Core\Data\IEntityConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.CustomerAppConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.CustomerAppKeyConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.CustomerConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.FeatureConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.LicenseConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.LicenseCustomerAppConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.PrivateKeyConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.SkuConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.SkuFeatureConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.TransactionConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.TransactionItemConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.UserObjectRightConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.VendorConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.OAuthMembershipConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.MembershipConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.RoleConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.UserConfiguration' KeyHub.Data.DataConfiguration.UserInRoleConfiguration
