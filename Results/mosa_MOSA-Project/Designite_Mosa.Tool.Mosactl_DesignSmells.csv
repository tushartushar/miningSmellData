Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Tool.Mosactl,PlattformAppCall,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Mosactl\MosaCtl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' target' Args
Imperative Abstraction,Mosa.Utility.Launcher,AppLocations,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.Launcher\AppLocations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FindApplications
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Tool.Mosactl,PlattformAppCall,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Mosactl\MosaCtl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: target' Args
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Tool.Mosactl,MosaCtl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Mosactl\MosaCtl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Tool.Mosactl.MosaCtl' Mosa.Tool.Mosactl.Program
