Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.x64,Internal,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x64\Internal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.x64,Internal,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x64\Internal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.Math.x64,Division,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x64\Math\Division.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime.x64,Native,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x64\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 63 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime.x64,Native,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x64\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 63 methods
