Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AbbrevList
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Compiler.Extensions.Dwarf,DwarfConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Extension.Dwarf\DwarfDefinitions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DW_CHILDREN_no' DW_CHILDREN_yes' NullAttributeName' NullAttributeValue' NullTag' NullFileTime' NullFileLength' EndOfFiles' EndOfDirectories
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Compiler.Extensions.Dwarf,DwarfAbbrev,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Extension.Dwarf\DwarfDefinitions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
