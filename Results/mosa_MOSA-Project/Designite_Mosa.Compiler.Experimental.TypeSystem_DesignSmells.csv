Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalField,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalMethod,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalMethod.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalParameter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalParameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalParameter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalParameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalProperty,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalType,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Namespace' BaseType' DeclaringType' Fields' Methods' Properties' IsInterface' IsEnum' IsDelegate' IsExplicitLayout' PrimitiveTypeCode' IsInteger' IsObject' IsInt32' IsInt64' IsFloat' IsDouble
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem,ExperimentalField,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem\ExperimentalField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem.ExperimentalField' Mosa.Compiler.Experimental.TypeSystem.ExperimentalType
