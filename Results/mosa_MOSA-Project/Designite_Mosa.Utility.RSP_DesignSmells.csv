Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Utility.RSP,GDBClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\GDBClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBClient' Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Utility.RSP,GDBClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\GDBClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBClient' Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.GetReasonHalted
Wide Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP,GDBCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\GDBCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.ClearBreakPoint' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.Continue' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.ExtendedMode' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.GeneralRegisterRead' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.GetReasonHalted' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.GetRegisters' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.Kill' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.ReadMemory' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.ReadRegister' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.SetBreakPoint' Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command.Step
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command,Continue,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\Command\Continue.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command,ExtendedMode,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\Command\ExtendedMode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command,GeneralRegisterRead,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\Command\GeneralRegisterRead.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command,GetReasonHalted,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\Command\GetReasonHalted.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command,Kill,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\Command\Kill.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.RSP.Command,Step,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.RSP\Command\Step.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Mosa.Utility.RSP.GDBCommand
