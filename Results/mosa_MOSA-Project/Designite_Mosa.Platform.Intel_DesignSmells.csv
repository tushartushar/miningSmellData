Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Platform.Intel,ControlRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\ControlRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CR0' CR2' CR3' CR4
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Platform.Intel,ControlRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\ControlRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Platform.Intel,GeneralPurposeRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\GeneralPurposeRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Platform.Intel,SegmentRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\SegmentRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Platform.Intel,SSE2Register,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\SSE2Register.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Platform.Intel,GeneralPurposeRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\GeneralPurposeRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' EAX' ECX' EDX' EBX' ESP' EBP' ESI' EDI' R8' R9' R10' R11' R12' R13' R14' R15
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Platform.Intel,OpcodeEncoder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\OpcodeEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Platform.Intel,OpcodeEncoder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\OpcodeEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Platform.Intel,SegmentRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\SegmentRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ES' CS' SS' DS' FS' GS
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Platform.Intel,SSE2Register,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\SSE2Register.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' XMM0' XMM1' XMM2' XMM3' XMM4' XMM5' XMM6' XMM7' XMM8' XMM9' XMM10' XMM11' XMM12' XMM13' XMM14' XMM15
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Platform.Intel.Stages,AddressModeConversionStage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\Stages\AddressModeConversionStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PopulateVisitationDictionary
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Platform.Intel.Stages,BuildStackStage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\Stages\BuildStackStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PopulateVisitationDictionary
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Platform.Intel.Stages,FloatingPointStage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\Stages\FloatingPointStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PopulateVisitationDictionary
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Platform.Intel.Stages,SimpleDeadCodeRemovalStage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Platform.Intel\Stages\SimpleDeadCodeRemovalStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PopulateVisitationDictionary
