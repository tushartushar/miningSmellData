Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common,TypeSystemTree,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common\TypeSystemTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateTree
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common,MethodData,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common\MethodData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' OrderedStageNames' OrderedDebugStageNames' InstructionLogs' DebugLogs' CounterData
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common,ViewNode<T>,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common\ViewNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common,MethodData,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common\MethodData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OrderedStageNames' OrderedDebugStageNames' InstructionLogs' DebugLogs' CounterData
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common,ViewNode<T>,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common\ViewNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common,MethodData,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.GUI.Common\MethodData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' OrderedStageNames' OrderedDebugStageNames' InstructionLogs' DebugLogs' CounterData
