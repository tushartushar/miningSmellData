Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Tool.Debugger,TcpServer,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Debugger\ConnectionProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Mosa.Tool.Debugger,DisplayView,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Debugger\DisplayView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Connect
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Tool.Debugger,MainForm,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Debugger\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DebugEngine
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Tool.Debugger,ConnectionProperties,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Debugger\ConnectionProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Tool.Debugger.ConnectionProperties' Mosa.Tool.Debugger.MainForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Tool.Debugger,MainForm,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Debugger\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Tool.Debugger.MainForm' Mosa.Tool.Debugger.ConnectionProperties
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Tool.Debugger,MethodCaller,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Tool.Debugger\MethodCaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect' Disconnect
