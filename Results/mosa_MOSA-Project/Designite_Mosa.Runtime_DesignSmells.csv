(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.Plug,MethodAttribute,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Plug\MethodAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.Plug,TypeAttribute,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Plug\TypeAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Runtime,SimpleStackTraceEntry,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\SimpleStackTraceEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MethodDefinition' Offset
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime,Intrinsic,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Intrinsic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Runtime,MDFieldDefinition,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\MetadataStructures\MDFieldDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' CustomAttributes' Attributes' FieldType' FieldData' OffsetOrSize' _name' _customAttributes' _attributes' _fieldType' _fieldData' _offsetOrSize
Broken Modularization,Mosa.Runtime,MDProtectedRegionDefinition,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\MetadataStructures\MDProtectedRegionDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartOffset' EndOffset' HandlerOffset' HandlerType' ExceptionType' _startOffset' _endOffset' _handlerOffset' _handlerType' _exceptionType
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime,Internal,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Internal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime,StringBuffer,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\_StringBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,System,RuntimeAssembly,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Builders\RuntimeAssembly.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Reflection.Assembly
Rebellious Hierarchy,System,RuntimeType,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Builders\RuntimeType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetGenericTypeDefinition' MakeArrayType' MakeArrayType' MakeByRefType' MakeGenericType' MakePointerType
Rebellious Hierarchy,System,RuntimeTypeInfo,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\Builders\RuntimeTypeInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetGenericParameterConstraints' GetGenericTypeDefinition' MakeArrayType' MakeArrayType' MakeByRefType' MakeGenericType' MakePointerType
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Runtime,ExceptionHandlerType,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime\ExceptionHandlerType.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.UInt32
