Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,CvLineEnumerator,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\CvLineEnumerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetEnumerator
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,CvSymbol1129,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\CvSymbol1129.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,CvSymbol1129,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\CvSymbol1129.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,PdbSymbolHeader,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\PdbSymbolHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,PdbTypesHeader,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\PdbTypesHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,PdbFileHeader,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\PdbFileHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: signature' dwPageSize' dwBitmapPage' dwFilePages' dwRootBytes' dwReserved' dwIndexPage
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,PdbRootStream,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\PdbRootStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: streams' streamLength' streamPages
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,PdbSymbolHeader,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\PdbSymbolHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: gsym_stream' module_size
Broken Hierarchy,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,CvEntryType,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\CvEntryType.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.UInt16
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Compiler.Pdb,PdbStream,C:\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Compiler.Pdb\PdbStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetLength' Write
