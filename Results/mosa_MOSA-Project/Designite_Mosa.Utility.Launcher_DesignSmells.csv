Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Mosa.Utility.Launcher,AppLocations,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.Launcher\AppLocations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FindApplications
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Utility.Launcher,CheckOptions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.Launcher\CheckOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Mosa.Utility.Launcher,LauncherOptions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.Launcher\LauncherOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SourceFile
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mosa.Utility.Launcher,Builder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.Launcher\Builder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mosa.Utility.Launcher.Builder' Mosa.Utility.Launcher.BuilderEventListener
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mosa.Utility.Launcher,BuilderEventListener,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Utility.Launcher\BuilderEventListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnTraceLog' OnMethodCompiled
