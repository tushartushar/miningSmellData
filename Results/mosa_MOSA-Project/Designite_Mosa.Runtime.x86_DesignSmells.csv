Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.x86,Internal,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x86\Internal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mosa.Runtime.Math.x86,Division,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x86\Math\Division.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime.x86,Native,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x86\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 326 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime.x86,Native,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x86\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 326 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mosa.Runtime.x86,Native,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mosa_MOSA-Project\Source\Mosa.Runtime.x86\Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 326
