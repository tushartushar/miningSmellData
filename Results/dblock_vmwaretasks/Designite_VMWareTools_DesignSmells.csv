Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,MappedNetworkDrive,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsMappedNetworkDrive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,ShellOutput,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsShell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' StdOut' StdErr
Deficient Encapsulation,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,MappedNetworkDriveInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsMappedNetworkDrive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RemotePath' LocalPath' Username' Password' Auto
Deficient Encapsulation,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,NETRESOURCE,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsMappedNetworkDrive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwScope' dwType' dwDisplayType' dwUsage' lpLocalName' lpRemoteName' lpComment' lpProvider
Deficient Encapsulation,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,ShellOutput,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsShell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StdOut' StdErr
Broken Modularization,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,NETRESOURCE,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsMappedNetworkDrive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwScope' dwType' dwDisplayType' dwUsage' lpLocalName' lpRemoteName' lpComment' lpProvider
Broken Hierarchy,Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.Windows,Shell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dblock_vmwaretasks\Source\VMWareTools\WindowsShell.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Vestris.VMWareLib.Tools.GuestOS
