Unutilized Abstraction,Hyperletter.Typed,AnswerCallbackEventArgs<TRequest;TReply>,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\AnswerCallbackEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hyperletter.Typed,DelegateOutstanding,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\DelegateOutstanding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Hyperletter.Typed,DictionaryList<TKey;TValue>,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\DictionaryList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hyperletter.Typed,NoMatchingConstructorException,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\NoMatchingConstructorException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Hyperletter.Typed,NoMatchingConstructorException,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\NoMatchingConstructorException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hyperletter.Typed,SocketDisposedException,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\SocketDisposedException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hyperletter.Typed,Registration,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\Registration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Hyperletter.Typed.Registration' Hyperletter.Typed.TypedHyperSocket
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hyperletter.Typed,TypedHyperSocket,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\TypedHyperSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Hyperletter.Typed.TypedHyperSocket' Hyperletter.Typed.Registration
Broken Hierarchy,Hyperletter.Typed,DelegateOutstanding,C:\repos\Jiddler_Hyperletter\Hyperletter.Typed\DelegateOutstanding.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Hyperletter.Typed.Outstanding
