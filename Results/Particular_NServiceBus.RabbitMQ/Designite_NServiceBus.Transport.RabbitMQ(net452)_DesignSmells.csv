Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ,ModelExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\Receiving\ModelExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ,MessageState,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\Receiving\ModelExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Channel' DeliveryTag
Feature Envy,NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ,MessageDispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\Sending\MessageDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Dispatch which is more interested in members of the type: ChannelProvider
Unutilized Abstraction,NServiceBus,RabbitMQTransportSettingsExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\Configuration\RabbitMQTransportSettingsExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ,SettingsKeys,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\Configuration\SettingsKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CustomMessageIdStrategy' TimeToWaitBeforeTriggeringCircuitBreaker' UsePublisherConfirms' PrefetchMultiplier' PrefetchCount' ClientCertificates' DisableRemoteCertificateValidation' UseExternalAuthMechanism' EnableTimeoutManager' UseDurableExchangesAndQueues
Rebellious Hierarchy,NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ,RabbitMQTransportInfrastructure,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\RabbitMQTransportInfrastructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BindToLocalEndpoint
Rebellious Hierarchy,NServiceBus,RabbitMQTransport,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_NServiceBus.RabbitMQ\src\NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ\RabbitMQTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
