Insufficient Modularization,ML.Utils,CookieParse,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\ML.Utils\CookieParse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 49 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ML.Utils,CookieParse,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\ML.Utils\CookieParse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 52 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ML.Utils,CookieParse,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\ML.Utils\CookieParse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 175
