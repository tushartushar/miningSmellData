Multifaceted Abstraction,Yaws,Host,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83
Multifaceted Abstraction,Yaws,Request,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Deficient Encapsulation,Yaws,Messages,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VersionString
Deficient Encapsulation,Yaws,Messages,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VersionString
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Connection,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Connection' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Connection,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Connection' Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Connection,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Connection' Server' Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Connection,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Connection' Host' Server' Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Host,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Host,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Host' Server' Request
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Host,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Host' Server' Messages' Connection' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Messages,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Messages' Connection' Server

Insufficient Modularization,Yaws,Request,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Yaws,Request,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 52 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Yaws,Request,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 154
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Request,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Request' Host
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Yaws,Request,C:\repos\JerryXia_ML\src\Yaws\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Request' Host' Server' Host' Server
