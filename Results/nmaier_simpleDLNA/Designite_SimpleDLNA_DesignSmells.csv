Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NMaier.SimpleDlna,NgenInstaller,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\NgenInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMaier.SimpleDlna.GUI,LogEntry,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\SimpleDLNA\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Class' Exception' Key' Message' Time
Unutilized Abstraction,NMaier.SimpleDlna.GUI,PathEnvironmentInstaller,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\SimpleDLNA\PathEnvironmentInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.GUI,ServerListViewItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\SimpleDLNA\ServerListViewItem.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateInfo which is more interested in members of the type: ServerDescription
Deficient Encapsulation,NMaier.SimpleDlna.GUI,LogEntry,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\SimpleDLNA\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Class' Exception' Key' Message' Time
Insufficient Modularization,NMaier.SimpleDlna.GUI,FormMain,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\SimpleDLNA\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Broken Modularization,NMaier.SimpleDlna.GUI,LogEntry,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\SimpleDLNA\FormMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Class' Exception' Key' Message' Time
