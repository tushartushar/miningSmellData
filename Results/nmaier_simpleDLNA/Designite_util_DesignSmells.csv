Deficient Encapsulation,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,MACInfo,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\AddressToMacResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Fresh' MAC
Insufficient Modularization,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,Logging,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 42 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,Logging,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Broken Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,AddressToMacResolver,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\AddressToMacResolver.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities.Logging
Cyclic Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,BaseSortPart,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\BaseSortPart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: NumericSortPart
Cyclic Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,BaseSortPart,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\BaseSortPart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: StringSortPart
Rebellious Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,ConcatenatedStream,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\ConcatenatedStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
Broken Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,ConfigParameters,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\ConfigParameters.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities.AttributeCollection
Rebellious Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,HttpStream,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\HttpStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write
Wide Hierarchy,NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities,Logging,C:\repos\nmaier_simpleDLNA\util\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: NMaier.SimpleDlna.FileMediaServer.FileStore' NMaier.SimpleDlna.FileMediaServer.Cover' NMaier.SimpleDlna.FileMediaServer.FileStoreVacuumer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.FileMediaServer.FileServer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.FileMediaServer.BaseFile' NMaier.SimpleDlna.ProgramIcon' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.MediaMount' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.HttpAuthorizer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.HttpClient' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.HttpServer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.ItemResponse' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.ResourceResponse' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.IPAddressAuthorizer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.MacAuthorizer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.Identifiers' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.UserAgentAuthorizer' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.Ssdp.Datagram' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.Ssdp.SsdpHandler' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Server.Views.BaseView' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Thumbnails.ThumbnailMaker' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Thumbnails.VideoThumbnailLoader' NMaier.SimpleDlna.Utilities.AddressToMacResolver
