Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Adapter,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Sage.SData.Client.Adapter' Sage.SData.Client.Atom
Unstable Dependency,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Atom,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Sage.SData.Client.Extensions' Sage.SData.Client.Adapter
Unstable Dependency,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Sage.SData.Client.Atom' System.Linq' Sage.SData.Client.Metadata
Unstable Dependency,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Sage.SData.Client.Metadata
Unstable Dependency,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Framework,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Sage.SData.Client.Atom
God Component,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Metadata,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 30
Feature Concentration,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Framework,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AttachedFile' RequestOperation' SDataRequest' ISDataResponse' SDataResponse' SDataUri' Tracking' UriFormatter' UriPathSegment' UriQueryParser' W3CDateTime' Digest' DigestEntry' HttpMethod' MediaType' MediaTypeNames' SyncState' UriPathParser]' [Common]' [DiagnosisCode' Diagnosis' SDataException' Severity]' [Diagnoses]' [SyncMode]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.2
Scattered Functionality,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Atom,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sage.SData.Client.Common' Sage.SData.Client.Extensions
Scattered Functionality,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Atom,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sage.SData.Client.Common' Sage.SData.Client.Adapter
Scattered Functionality,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sage.SData.Client.Common' System.Linq
Scattered Functionality,Sage.SData.Client_2_0,Sage.SData.Client.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Sage.SData.Client.Common' Sage.SData.Client.Framework
