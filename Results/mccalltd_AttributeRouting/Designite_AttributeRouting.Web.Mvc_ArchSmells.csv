Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.Framework,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.Configuration' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.RouteCollectionExtensions' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.Framework.AttributeRoute' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.Framework.RouteConstraintFactory
Unstable Dependency,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): AttributeRouting' AttributeRouting.Framework' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.Framework,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.ConfigurationBase' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.RouteBuilder' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.AttributeRoute
Feature Concentration,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Configuration' RouteCollectionExtensions]' [DELETEAttribute' RouteAttribute' RestfulRouteConventionAttribute' RestfulRouteConventionInfo' GETAttribute' POSTAttribute' PUTAttribute]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.Configuration' AttributeRouting.Web.Mvc.RouteCollectionExtensions
