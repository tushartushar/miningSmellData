Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost,HttpRouteCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mccalltd_AttributeRouting\src\AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost\HttpRouteCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework,RouteConstraintFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mccalltd_AttributeRouting\src\AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost\Framework\RouteConstraintFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework.RouteConstraintFactory' AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.HttpWebConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework,AttributeRouteFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mccalltd_AttributeRouting\src\AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost\Framework\AttributeRouteFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework.AttributeRouteFactory' AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.HttpWebConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework,RouteConstraintFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mccalltd_AttributeRouting\src\AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost\Framework\RouteConstraintFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework.RouteConstraintFactory' AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.HttpWebConfiguration' AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost.Framework.AttributeRouteFactory
Broken Hierarchy,AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost,HttpWebConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mccalltd_AttributeRouting\src\AttributeRouting.Web.Http.WebHost\HttpWebConfiguration.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AttributeRouting.Web.Http.HttpConfigurationBase
