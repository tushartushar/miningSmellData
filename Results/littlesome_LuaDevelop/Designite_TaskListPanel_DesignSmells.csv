Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,TaskListPanel,PluginMain,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Multifaceted Abstraction,TaskListPanel,PluginUI,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Deficient Encapsulation,TaskListPanel,ExplorationContext,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Status' Files' Worker' Directories' ExcludedPaths' HiddenPaths
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TaskListPanel,PluginMain,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PluginMain' PluginUI
Insufficient Modularization,TaskListPanel,PluginUI,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TaskListPanel,PluginUI,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Broken Modularization,TaskListPanel,ExplorationContext,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Status' Files' Worker' Directories' ExcludedPaths' HiddenPaths
Broken Modularization,TaskListPanel,Settings,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\TaskListPanel\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
