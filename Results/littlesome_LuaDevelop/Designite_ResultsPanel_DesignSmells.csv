Multifaceted Abstraction,ResultsPanel,PluginMain,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\PluginMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Multifaceted Abstraction,ResultsPanel,PluginUI,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unnecessary Abstraction,ResultsPanel,Settings,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ScrollToBottom' scrollToBottom
Deficient Encapsulation,ResultsPanel,PluginMain,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\PluginMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NextError' PrevError
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ResultsPanel,PluginMain,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\PluginMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PluginMain' PluginUI
Insufficient Modularization,ResultsPanel,PluginUI,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ResultsPanel,PluginUI,C:\repos\littlesome_LuaDevelop\External\Plugins\ResultsPanel\PluginUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
