Duplicate Abstraction,Observer.ClearImplementation,Stock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\ClearImplementation\Stock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Stock (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\ClearImplementation\Stock.cs' [20' 42])' ObservableStock (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\DotNetEvents\ObservableStock.cs' [27' 49])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Observer.ClearImplementation,IInvestor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\ClearImplementation\IInvestor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Observer.ClearImplementation.IInvestor' Observer.ClearImplementation.Stock
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Observer.DotNetEvents,ObservableStock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\DotNetEvents\ObservableStock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Observer.DotNetEvents.ObservableStock' Observer.DotNetEvents.StockPriceChangedEventArgs
Broken Hierarchy,Observer.ClearImplementation,GoogleStock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\ClearImplementation\GoogleStock.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Observer.ClearImplementation.Stock
Broken Hierarchy,Observer.ClearImplementation,IbmStock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\17. Design Patterns\Demo\Behavioral\Observer\ClearImplementation\IbmStock.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Observer.ClearImplementation.Stock
