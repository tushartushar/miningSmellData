Insufficient Modularization,Exocortex.DSP,ComplexArray,D:\newReposJune17\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\10. Code Tuning and Optimization\Demo\Mandelbrot-Fractal\ComplexArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Exocortex.DSP,ComplexArray,D:\newReposJune17\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\10. Code Tuning and Optimization\Demo\Mandelbrot-Fractal\ComplexArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Exocortex.DSP,Fourier,D:\newReposJune17\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\10. Code Tuning and Optimization\Demo\Mandelbrot-Fractal\Fourier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Exocortex.DSP,Fourier,D:\newReposJune17\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\10. Code Tuning and Optimization\Demo\Mandelbrot-Fractal\Fourier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 184
Missing Hierarchy,Exocortex.DSP,Complex,D:\newReposJune17\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\10. Code Tuning and Optimization\Demo\Mandelbrot-Fractal\Complex.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Complex' ComplexF (in method "CompareTo" of class "Complex").
Missing Hierarchy,Exocortex.DSP,ComplexF,D:\newReposJune17\TelerikAcademy_High-Quality-Code\10. Code Tuning and Optimization\Demo\Mandelbrot-Fractal\ComplexF.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types.
