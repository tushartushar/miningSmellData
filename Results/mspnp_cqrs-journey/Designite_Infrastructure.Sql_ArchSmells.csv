Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,Infrastructure.Sql,Infrastructure.Sql.Messaging.Implementation,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Infrastructure.Sql.Messaging,Infrastructure.Sql.Messaging.Implementation.Message
Feature Concentration,Infrastructure.Sql,Infrastructure.Sql.MessageLog,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SqlMessageLogHandler' SqlMessageLog' SqlQuery' DisposingEnumerator' MessageLogDbContext]' [MessageLogEntity' QueryCriteriaExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29,Infrastructure.Sql.MessageLog.MessageLogEntity' Infrastructure.Sql.MessageLog.QueryCriteriaExtensions
Feature Concentration,Infrastructure.Sql,Infrastructure.Sql.Messaging,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CommandBus' IMessageSender' Message' MessageReceivedEventArgs' EventBus]' [IMessageReceiver]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,Infrastructure.Sql.Messaging.IMessageReceiver
Scattered Functionality,Infrastructure.Sql,Infrastructure.Sql.MessageLog,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Infrastructure' Infrastructure.Serialization,Infrastructure.IMetadataProvider' Infrastructure.Serialization.TextSerializerExtensions
