Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Ambiguous Interface,Builder,Builder,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: BauBuild,Builder.BauBuild
Feature Concentration,Builder,Builder,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BauBuild' Folders' Projects' SharpFlame' Gui' Core' BuildContext]' [TemplatesProject]' [Tests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,Builder.TemplatesProject' Builder.Tests
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.6  All the dependencies among components: from: Eto.Gl.Gtk' to: Eto.Gl' from: Eto.Gl.Mac' to: Eto.Gl' from: Eto.Gl.Windows' to: Eto.Gl' from: SharpFlame.Collections.Specialized' to:
