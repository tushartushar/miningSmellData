Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Caching,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Caching.Search,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Caching.FileFinder' OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Caching.HierarchyBuilder
Unstable Dependency,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Endpoints,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.ReactiveScripts,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Endpoints.ReactiveScriptEngine
Feature Concentration,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.UI,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
