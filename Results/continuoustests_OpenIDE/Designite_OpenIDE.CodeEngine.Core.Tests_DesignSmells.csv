Unutilized Abstraction,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests.Caching,HierarchyBuilderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\Caching\HierarchyBuilderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests.Caching,TypeCacheTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\Caching\TypeCacheTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests.FileSystem,PathParserTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\FileSystem\PathParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests,CrawlHandlerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\ChangeTrackersCrawlHandlerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests,CrawlHandlerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\ChangeTrackersCrawlHandlerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: When_given_files_and_types_it_will_add_them_to_cache which is more interested in members of the type: Fake_Cache
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests.Commands,QueryArgumentParserTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\Commands\QueryArgumentParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests.ReactiveScripts,ScriptTouchHandlerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\ReactiveScripts\ScriptTouchHandlerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests,Fake_Cache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\ChangeTrackersCrawlHandlerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Projects' Files' References' SignatureReferences
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests,Fake_Cache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\continuoustests_OpenIDE\OpenIDE.CodeEngine.Core.Tests\ChangeTrackersCrawlHandlerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Invalidate
