Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,OpenIDE.Tests,OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CommandBuilderTests' When_constructing_the_command_builder' When_navigating_to_a_command' When_navigating_to_invalid_command' When_describing_a_valid_path' When_describing_an_invalidvalid_path]' [CommandAutoCompletionTests' Auto' PathAutoCompletionTests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.CommandAutoCompletionTests' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.Auto' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.PathAutoCompletionTests,OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.CommandBuilderTests' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.When_constructing_the_command_builder' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.When_navigating_to_a_command' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.When_navigating_to_invalid_command' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.When_describing_a_valid_path' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.When_describing_an_invalidvalid_path' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.CommandAutoCompletionTests' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.Auto' OpenIDE.Tests.CommandBuilding.PathAutoCompletionTests
Scattered Functionality,OpenIDE.Tests,OpenIDE.Tests.EditorEngineIntegration,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: OpenIDE.Core.FileSystem' OpenIDE.Core.EditorEngineIntegration,OpenIDE.Core.FileSystem.IFS' OpenIDE.Core.FileSystem.FS' OpenIDE.Core.EditorEngineIntegration.EngineLocator,OpenIDE.Core.FileSystem.IFS' OpenIDE.Core.FileSystem.FS' OpenIDE.Core.EditorEngineIntegration.EngineLocator
