Unnecessary Abstraction,MtpTester,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MtpTester,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MtpTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MtpTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs' [243' 262])' MainWindow (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs' [278' 297])
Feature Envy,MtpTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadDeviceData which is more interested in members of the type: XmlDeviceData
Feature Envy,MtpTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitUi which is more interested in members of the type: XmlDeviceData
Feature Envy,MtpTester,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveData which is more interested in members of the type: XmlDeviceData
Unnecessary Abstraction,MtpTester.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dukus_digiCamControl\MtpTester\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
