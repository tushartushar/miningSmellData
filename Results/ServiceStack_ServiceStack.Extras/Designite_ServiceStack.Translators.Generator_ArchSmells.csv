Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Filters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Filters' ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Filters.CodeFilters' ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.ExtensionTranslatorClassGenerator' ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Program
Unstable Dependency,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Filters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Filters.CodeLang
Feature Concentration,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Support,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CommandLineSwitchAttribute' Parser' SwitchRecord' CommandLineAliasAttribute' SwitchInfo]' [TranslateNameUtils]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Support.TranslateNameUtils
