Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,ServiceStack.SpringFactory,ServiceStack.SpringFactory,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ServiceStack.SpringFactory' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.Support,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.FactoryUtils' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.Support.ObjectConfigurationTypeFactory,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.FactoryUtils' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.Support.ObjectConfigurationTypeFactory
Unstable Dependency,ServiceStack.SpringFactory,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.Support,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ServiceStack.SpringFactory,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.Support.IObjectFactory,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.Support.IObjectFactory
Feature Concentration,ServiceStack.SpringFactory,ServiceStack.SpringFactory,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CreateFromLargestConstructorTypeFactory' ConstructorDefinition' FactoryProvider' FactoryProviderHandlerFactory' IObjectFactory' EmptyObjectFactory' FactoryUtils]' [ObjectsConfigurationSectionHandler]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.ObjectsConfigurationSectionHandler,ServiceStack.SpringFactory.CreateFromLargestConstructorTypeFactory' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.ConstructorDefinition' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.EmptyObjectFactory' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.FactoryProvider' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.FactoryProviderHandlerFactory' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.FactoryUtils' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.IObjectFactory' ServiceStack.SpringFactory.ObjectsConfigurationSectionHandler
