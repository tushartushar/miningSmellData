Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider,ICriteriaExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.DataAccess\ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider\ICriteriaExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider,NHibernateProviderManagerFactory,D:\newReposJune17\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.DataAccess\ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider\NHibernateProviderManagerFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider,NHibernatePersistenceProvider,D:\newReposJune17\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.DataAccess\ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider\NHibernatePersistenceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider,NHibernatePersistenceProvider,D:\newReposJune17\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.DataAccess\ServiceStack.DataAccess.NHibernateProvider\NHibernatePersistenceProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NHibernatePersistenceProvider' NHibernateTransaction
