Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Support,SwitchInfo,C:\repos\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.Translators.Generator\Support\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Support,TranslateNameUtils,C:\repos\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.Translators.Generator\Support\TranslateNameUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,CodeDomUtils,C:\repos\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.Translators.Generator\CodeDomUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 52 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,CodeDomUtils,C:\repos\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.Translators.Generator\CodeDomUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 52 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator,TranslatorClassGenerator,C:\repos\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.Translators.Generator\TranslatorClassGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Missing Hierarchy,ServiceStack.Translators.Generator.Support,Parser,C:\repos\ServiceStack_ServiceStack.Extras\src\ServiceStack.Translators.Generator\Support\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CommandLineSwitchAttribute' CommandLineAliasAttribute (in method "Parser" of class "Parser").
