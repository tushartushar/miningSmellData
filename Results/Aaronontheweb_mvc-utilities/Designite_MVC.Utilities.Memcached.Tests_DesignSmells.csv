Unnecessary Abstraction,MVC.Utilities.Tests.TestData,UserAccount,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Tests\TestData\TestDataHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DateJoined' EmailAddress' Password' UserName' FullName
Unutilized Abstraction,MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests.Memcached,MemcachedServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests\Memcached\MemcachedServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests.Memcached,MemcachedServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests\Memcached\MemcachedServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Should_Find_Item_in_Cache which is more interested in members of the type: ICacheService
Feature Envy,MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests.Memcached,MemcachedServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests\Memcached\MemcachedServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Should_Get_Item_From_Cache which is more interested in members of the type: ICacheService
Feature Envy,MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests.Memcached,MemcachedServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests\Memcached\MemcachedServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.

Feature Envy,MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests.Memcached,MemcachedServiceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests\Memcached\MemcachedServiceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Should_Overwrite_Item_in_Cache which is more interested in members of the type: ICacheService
Unnecessary Abstraction,MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests.TestData,MemcacheProcessHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Aaronontheweb_mvc-utilities\MVC.Utilities.Memcached.Tests\TestData\MemcacheProcessHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MemcachePath' MEMCACHE_PROCESS_ENTRYPOINT
