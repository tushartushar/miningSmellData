Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,CSEvilTestor,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: __Run which is more interested in members of the type: CLS_Environment
Unnecessary Abstraction,CSEvilTestor,StateMgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\TestReg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,CSEvilTestor,MyClass2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\TestReg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,CSEvilTestor.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,CSEvilTestor,Item,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: path' test
Deficient Encapsulation,CSEvilTestor,Debug,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Logger
Deficient Encapsulation,CSEvilTestor,Debug,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Logger
Deficient Encapsulation,CSEvilTestor.testfunc,CSLEConvert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\testfunc\CSLEConvert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: env
Deficient Encapsulation,CSEvilTestor.testfunc,CSLEConvert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\testfunc\CSLEConvert.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: env
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CSEvilTestor,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lightszero_cslightcore\windows\CSEvilTestor\Form1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CSEvilTestor.Form1' CSEvilTestor.Program' CSEvilTestor.TestReg
