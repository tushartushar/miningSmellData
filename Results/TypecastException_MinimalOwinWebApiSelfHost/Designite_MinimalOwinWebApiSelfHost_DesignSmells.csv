Unutilized Abstraction,MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost.Controllers,CompaniesController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TypecastException_MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\Controllers\CompaniesController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost.Controllers,CompaniesController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TypecastException_MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\Controllers\CompaniesController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Post which is more interested in members of the type: ApplicationDbContext

The method causing this smell is: Delete which is more interested in members of the type: ApplicationDbContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost.Models,Company,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TypecastException_MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\Models\Company.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost.Models,ApplicationDbContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TypecastException_MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost\Models\ApplicationDbContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost.Models.ApplicationDbContext' MinimalOwinWebApiSelfHost.Models.ApplicationDbInitializer
