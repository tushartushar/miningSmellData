Unutilized Abstraction,OpenTK,NativeMethods,C:\repos\andykorth_opentk\Source\GLControl\Sdl2GLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenTK,MSG,C:\repos\andykorth_opentk\Source\GLControl\WinGLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HWnd' Message' WParam' LParam' Time' Point
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenTK,POINT,C:\repos\andykorth_opentk\Source\GLControl\WinGLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenTK,XVisualInfo,C:\repos\andykorth_opentk\Source\GLControl\X11GLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Visual' VisualID' Screen' Depth' Class' RedMask' GreenMask' blueMask' ColormapSize' BitsPerRgb
Unfactored Hierarchy,OpenTK,DummyGLControl,C:\repos\andykorth_opentk\Source\GLControl\DummyGLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
