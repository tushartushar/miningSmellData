Duplicate Abstraction,MyBean.Core,ClassObject,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\ClassFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: MyBean.Core.ClassObject' MyBean.Core.Default.ClassObject
Duplicate Abstraction,MyBean.Core,ClassObject,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\ClassFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ClassObject[34' 63]' ClassObject[42' 71]

Unutilized Abstraction,MyBean.Core,ClassFactory,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\ClassFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MyBean.Core,TypeHelper,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\TypeHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MyBean.Core.Default,AssemblyItem,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\Default\DefaultAssemblyFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Value
Unutilized Abstraction,MyBean.Core.Helper,BytesHelper,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\Helper\BytesHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MyBean.Core.Helper,IntHelper,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\Helper\IntHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MyBean.Core.Res,StringRes,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\Res\StringRes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ExceptionRegsterRepeat' ExceptionAssemblyNotFound' ExceptionObjectFactoryIsNull' ExceptionObjectCreateIsNull
Deficient Encapsulation,MyBean.Core,ClassObject,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\ClassFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: id' classFullName' classType
Deficient Encapsulation,MyBean.Core.Default,ClassObject,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\Default\DefaultApplicationContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: id' classFullName' classType' context
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MyBean.Core.Default,ClassObject,C:\repos\ymofen_mybean.net\MyBean.Core\Default\DefaultApplicationContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ClassObject' DefaultApplicationContext
