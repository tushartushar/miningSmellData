Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit,ITickProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\ITickProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Ticks
Unutilized Abstraction,MassTransit,NewIdExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MassTransit,NewIdGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NewIdGenerator (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdGenerator.cs' [47' 74])' NewIdGenerator (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdGenerator.cs' [79' 106])
Unnecessary Abstraction,MassTransit.NewIdProviders,DateTimeTickProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdProviders\DateTimeTickProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Ticks
Insufficient Modularization,MassTransit,NewId,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewId.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MassTransit,INewIdGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\INewIdGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MassTransit.INewIdGenerator' MassTransit.NewId
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MassTransit,NewIdGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MassTransit.NewIdGenerator' MassTransit.NewId
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MassTransit,INewIdGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\INewIdGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MassTransit.INewIdGenerator' MassTransit.NewIdGenerator' MassTransit.NewId
Broken Hierarchy,MassTransit.NewIdFormatters,ZBase32Formatter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdFormatters\ZBase32Formatter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MassTransit.NewIdFormatters.Base32Formatter
Broken Hierarchy,MassTransit.NewIdParsers,ZBase32Parser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_NewId\src\NewId\NewIdParsers\ZBase32Parser.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MassTransit.NewIdParsers.Base32Parser
