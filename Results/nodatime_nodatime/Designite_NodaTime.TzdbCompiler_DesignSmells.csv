Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MergeWindowsZones
Imperative Abstraction,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,DateTimeZoneBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\DateTimeZoneBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Build
Unutilized Abstraction,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,IoExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\IoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,NameIdMappingSupport,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\NameIdMappingSupport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' StandardNameToIdMap
Feature Envy,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,RuleLine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\RuleLine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetRecurrences which is more interested in members of the type: ZoneRecurrence
Imperative Abstraction,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,TzdbStreamWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\TzdbStreamWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Write
Imperative Abstraction,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,TzdbZoneInfoCompiler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\TzdbZoneInfoCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Compile
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,RuleLine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\RuleLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb.RuleLine' NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb.ZoneLine
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,TzdbDatabase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\TzdbDatabase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb.TzdbDatabase' NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb.TzdbStreamWriter
Rebellious Hierarchy,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,RuleLine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\RuleLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Equals' GetHashCode
Rebellious Hierarchy,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,StringPoolOptimizingFakeWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\TzdbStreamWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteMilliseconds' WriteOffset' WriteCount' WriteByte' WriteSignedCount' WriteZoneIntervalTransition
Rebellious Hierarchy,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,ZoneLine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\ZoneLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Equals
Rebellious Hierarchy,NodaTime.TzdbCompiler.Tzdb,ZoneTransition,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzdbCompiler\Tzdb\ZoneTransition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
