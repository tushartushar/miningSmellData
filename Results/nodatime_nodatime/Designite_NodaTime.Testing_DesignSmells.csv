Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NodaTime.Testing.Extensions,DurationConstruction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.Testing\Extensions\DurationConstruction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NodaTime.Testing.Extensions,LocalDateConstruction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.Testing\Extensions\LocalDateConstruction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NodaTime.Testing.TimeZones,Builder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.Testing\TimeZones\FakeDateTimeZoneSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NodaTime.Testing.TimeZones,MultiTransitionDateTimeZone,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.Testing\TimeZones\MultiTransitionDateTimeZone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetZoneInterval
Rebellious Hierarchy,NodaTime.Testing.TimeZones,FakeDateTimeZoneSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.Testing\TimeZones\FakeDateTimeZoneSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetIds
Rebellious Hierarchy,NodaTime.Testing.TimeZones,SingleTransitionDateTimeZone,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.Testing\TimeZones\SingleTransitionDateTimeZone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetZoneInterval
