Imperative Abstraction,NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump,ZoneDumper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump\ZoneDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dump
Feature Envy,NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump,ZoneDumper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump\ZoneDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WriteHeaders which is more interested in members of the type: Options
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nodatime_nodatime\src\NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump.Program' NodaTime.TzValidate.NodaDump.ZoneDumper
