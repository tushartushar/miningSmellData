Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OSC.NET,OSCBundle,C:\repos\mkalten_TUIO11_NET\OSC.NET\OSCBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OSCBundle' OSCPacket
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OSC.NET,OSCBundle,C:\repos\mkalten_TUIO11_NET\OSC.NET\OSCBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OSCBundle' OSCPacket' OscTimeTag' OSCPacket
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OSC.NET,OSCPacket,C:\repos\mkalten_TUIO11_NET\OSC.NET\OSCPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OSCPacket' OscTimeTag
Insufficient Modularization,TUIO,TuioClient,C:\repos\mkalten_TUIO11_NET\TUIO\TuioClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 132
Unfactored Hierarchy,OSC.NET,OSCBundle,C:\repos\mkalten_TUIO11_NET\OSC.NET\OSCBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: OSCBundle[1' 29]' OSCMessage[1' 29]
Cyclic Hierarchy,OSC.NET,OSCPacket,C:\repos\mkalten_TUIO11_NET\OSC.NET\OSCPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: OSCBundle
