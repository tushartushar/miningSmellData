Unnecessary Abstraction,LibSVMsharp.Core,svm_node,C:\repos\ccerhan_LibSVMsharp\LibSVMsharp\Core\svm_node.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' index' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,LibSVMsharp.Core,svm_problem,C:\repos\ccerhan_LibSVMsharp\LibSVMsharp\Core\svm_problem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' l' y' x
Unutilized Abstraction,LibSVMsharp.Extensions,SVMModelExtensions,C:\repos\ccerhan_LibSVMsharp\LibSVMsharp\Extensions\SVMModelExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
