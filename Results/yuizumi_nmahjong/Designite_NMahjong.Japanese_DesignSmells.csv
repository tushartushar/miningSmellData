Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMahjong.Japanese,IPlayerAction,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\IPlayerAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMahjong.Japanese,IPlayerHand,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\IPlayerHand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Count
Unnecessary Abstraction,NMahjong.Japanese,IWall,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\IWall.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Count
Unutilized Abstraction,NMahjong.Japanese,PlayerStates,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\PlayerStates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NMahjong.Japanese,TileAnnotationsExtension,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\TileAnnotationsExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,NMahjong.Japanese,IGameState,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\IGameState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Players' HandState' Turn' Wall' Dealer' Dora' PrevailingWind' HandNumber' Counters' RiichiSticks
Broken Modularization,NMahjong.Japanese,IPlayerState,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\IPlayerState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Score' SeatWind' Tiles' Discards' Melds
Cyclic Hierarchy,NMahjong.Japanese,AnnotatedTile,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\AnnotatedTile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CanonicalTile
Broken Hierarchy,NMahjong.Japanese,CanonicalTile,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\CanonicalTile.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AnnotatedTile
Wide Hierarchy,NMahjong.Japanese,IPlayerAction,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\IPlayerAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AbortiveDrawAction' ChowAction' ConcealedKongAction' DiscardAction' ExtendedKongAction' MahjongAction' NoneAction' OpenKongAction' PungAction' RiichiAction
Missing Hierarchy,NMahjong.Japanese,Actions,C:\repos\yuizumi_nmahjong\src\japanese\actions\Actions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MeldAction' DiscardAction (in method "AreIdentical" of class "Actions").
