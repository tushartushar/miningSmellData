Unnecessary Abstraction,CacheAspect.Attributes,Cache,C:\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Attributes\Cacheable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CacheAspect.Attributes,Cache,C:\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Attributes\Cacheable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CacheAspect.Attributes,IgnoreAttribute,C:\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Attributes\Parameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CacheName
Deficient Encapsulation,CacheAspect,OutOfProcessMemoryCache,C:\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Implementations\OutOfProcessMemoryCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CacheName
Broken Modularization,CacheAspect.Config,AopCacheConfiguration,C:\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Config\AopCacheConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CacheType' Path' TimeToLive' PathAttribute' TtlAttribute' TypeAttribute
Rebellious Hierarchy,CacheAspect,NoCache,C:\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Implementations\NoCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
