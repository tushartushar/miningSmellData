(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CacheAspect.Attributes,TriggerInvalidation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Attributes\TriggerInvalidation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CacheAspect.Supporting,DateWrapper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Supporting\DateWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Object' Timestamp
Deficient Encapsulation,CacheAspect,CacheService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\CacheService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Cache' Configuration' DiskPath' TimeToLive
Deficient Encapsulation,CacheAspect,CacheService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\CacheService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Cache' Configuration' DiskPath' TimeToLive
Deficient Encapsulation,CacheAspect,OutOfProcessMemoryCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Implementations\OutOfProcessMemoryCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CacheName
Deficient Encapsulation,CacheAspect,OutOfProcessMemoryCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Implementations\OutOfProcessMemoryCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CacheName
Broken Modularization,CacheAspect.Config,AopCacheConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Config\AopCacheConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CacheType' Path' TimeToLive' PathAttribute' TtlAttribute' TypeAttribute
Rebellious Hierarchy,CacheAspect,NoCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\agbell_attribute-based-caching\Cache\Implementations\NoCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Delete' Clear
