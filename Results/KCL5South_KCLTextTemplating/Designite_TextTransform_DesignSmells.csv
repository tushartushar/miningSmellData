Imperative Abstraction,Mono.TextTemplating,TextTransform,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\TextTransform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionSet' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext' Option' OptionContext

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionContext,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionContext' Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionContext,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionContext' Option' OptionSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,Option,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Option' OptionContext' OptionSet' OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 127
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,C:\repos\KCL5South_KCLTextTemplating\TextTransform\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionSet' OptionContext
