Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Internal.Web.Utils,CommonResources,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\CommonResources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CommonResources (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\CommonResources.Designer.cs' [51' 71])' WebDataResources (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\Resources\WebDataResources.Designer.cs' [43' 63])
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebMatrix.WebData,FormsAuthenticationSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\FormsAuthenticationSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LoginUrlKey' DefaultLoginUrl' PreserveLoginUrlKey
Unutilized Abstraction,WebMatrix.WebData,PreApplicationStartCode,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\PreApplicationStartCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,WebMatrix.WebData,SimpleMembershipProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\SimpleMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SimpleMembershipProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\SimpleMembershipProvider.cs' [124' 149])' SimpleRoleProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\SimpleRoleProvider.cs' [81' 106])
Insufficient Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,ExtendedMembershipProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\ExtendedMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,SimpleMembershipProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\SimpleMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,SimpleMembershipProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\SimpleMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,SimpleMembershipProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\SimpleMembershipProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 152
Insufficient Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,WebSecurity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\WebSecurity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,WebSecurity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\WebSecurity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebMatrix.WebData,ConfigUtil,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_aspnetwebstack\src\WebMatrix.WebData\ConfigUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebMatrix.WebData.ConfigUtil' WebMatrix.WebData.WebSecurity
