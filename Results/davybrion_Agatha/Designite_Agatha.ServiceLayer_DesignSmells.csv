Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Agatha.ServiceLayer,ServiceLayerAndClientConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\ServiceLayerAndClientConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,ServiceLayerAndClientConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\ServiceLayerAndClientConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Initialize which is more interested in members of the type: ServiceLayerConfiguration
Unnecessary Abstraction,Agatha.ServiceLayer,ITypedRequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,Agatha.ServiceLayer.WCF.Rest,RestRequestBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\WCF\Rest\RestRequestBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ValidateCollection which is more interested in members of the type: RestRequestValidator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestProcessingErrorHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestProcessingErrorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Agatha.ServiceLayer.RequestProcessingErrorHandler' Agatha.ServiceLayer.ServiceLayerConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Agatha.ServiceLayer.RequestProcessor' Agatha.ServiceLayer.ServiceLayerConfiguration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestProcessingErrorHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestProcessingErrorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Agatha.ServiceLayer.RequestProcessingErrorHandler' Agatha.ServiceLayer.ServiceLayerConfiguration' Agatha.ServiceLayer.RequestProcessor
Rebellious Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,OneWayRequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Handle' DisposeManagedResources
Wide Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Agatha.ServiceLayer.RequestHandler<TRequest'TResponse>' Sample.ServiceLayer.Handlers.GetAgeHandler' Sample.ServiceLayer.Handlers.GetCacheHandler' Sample.ServiceLayer.Handlers.GetServerDateHandler' Sample.ServiceLayer.Handlers.HelloWorldHandler' Sample.ServiceLayer.Handlers.ReverseStringHandler' Tests.ConfigurationTests.RequestHandlerA' Tests.ConfigurationTests.RequestHandlerBase<T>' Tests.RequestProcessorTests.Interceptors.SpyRequestHandler' Tests.RequestProcessorTests.Interceptors.ThrowingRequestHandler' TestTypes.RequestHandlerB
Rebellious Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Handle' CreateDefaultResponse' DisposeManagedResources
Multipath Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,OneWayRequestHandler<TRequest>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IOneWayRequestHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,OneWayRequestHandler<TRequest>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Handle
Multipath Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestHandler<TRequest;TResponse>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IRequestHandler
Rebellious Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestHandler<TRequest;TResponse>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Handle
Rebellious Hierarchy,Agatha.ServiceLayer,RequestProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\davybrion_Agatha\Agatha.ServiceLayer\RequestProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DisposeManagedResources
