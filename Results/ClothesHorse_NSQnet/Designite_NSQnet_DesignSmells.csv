Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NSQnet,NSQ,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQ.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSQnet,NSQUtil,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NSQnet,NSQClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: NSQClient which is more interested in members of the type: NSQProtocol
Unnecessary Abstraction,NSQnet,NSQServerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Version
Unutilized Abstraction,NSQnet,NSQProtocolException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQProtocolException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSQnet,StreamExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\StreamExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NSQnet.Extensions,ObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\ObjectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NSQnet,NSQSubscriber,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQSubscriber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _subscriptions
Insufficient Modularization,NSQnet,NSQLookup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Modularization,NSQnet,NSQProducer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQLookup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Address' Hostname' Broadcast_Address' TCP_Port' Http_Port' Version
Insufficient Modularization,NSQnet,NSQProtocol,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Modularization,NSQnet,NSQResponseString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\NSQResponseString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HEARTBEAT' OK' E_INVALID' E_TOUCH_FAILED' E_REQ_FAILED' E_FIN_FAILED' E_BAD_TOPIC' E_BAD_BODY' E_BAD_MESSAGE' E_BAD_CHANNEL' E_MPUB_FAILED' E_PUB_FAILED' CLOSE_WAIT

The participating classes in the cycle are: NSQnet.AgileObject' NSQnet.JsonSerializer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NSQnet,JsonArray,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\JSONSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NSQnet.JsonArray' NSQnet.JsonSerializer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NSQnet,AgileObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ClothesHorse_NSQnet\NSQnet\AgileObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NSQnet.AgileObject' NSQnet.JsonSerializer' NSQnet.JsonArray
