Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Scutex.Licensing,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Bootstrapper' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.LicensingManager' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.MasterHooker' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.LicenseWindow' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.MoreInfoContent' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.RegisterContent
Unstable Dependency,Scutex.Licensing,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui' WaveTech.Scutex.Services' WaveTech.Scutex.Providers.WebServicesProvider,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.LicenseWindow' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Hooker
Feature Concentration,Scutex.Licensing,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ChangeToColorConverter]' [GuiRoot' LocalizationRoot]' [LicenseWindow]' [MoreInfoContent]' [RegisterContent]' [WelcomeContent]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.86,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.ChangeToColorConverter' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.LicenseWindow' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.MoreInfoContent' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.RegisterContent' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.WelcomeContent
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.48  All the dependencies among components: from: WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing' to: WaveTech.Scutex.Framework' from: WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing' to: WaveTech.Scutex.Model' from:
