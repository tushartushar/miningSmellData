(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing,ScutexLicenseProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\ScutexLicenseProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,ChangeToColorConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\ChangeToColorConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,GuiRoot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\GuiRoot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: WarningText
Unnecessary Abstraction,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,LocalizationRoot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\LocalizationRoot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,MoreInfoContent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\MoreInfoContent.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: btnBuyNowUrl_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ClientLicense
Feature Envy,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui,MoreInfoContent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\MoreInfoContent.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: btnEulaUrl_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ClientLicense
Imperative Abstraction,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.Controls,MaskedTextBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\Controls\MaskedTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: IsTextValid
Unutilized Abstraction,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.Controls,MaskedTextBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\Gui\Controls\MaskedTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing,LicensingManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\LicensingManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.LicensingManager' WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing.Gui.LicenseWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WaveTech.Scutex.Licensing,LicensingManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ucswift_Scutex\Applications\Licensing\LicensingManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
