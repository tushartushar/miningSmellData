Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tavis.HttpCache,HttpCacheHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tavis-software_Tavis.PrivateCache\src\HttpCache\HttpCacheHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tavis.HttpCache,CacheQueryResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tavis-software_Tavis.PrivateCache\src\HttpCache\CacheQueryResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SelectedEntry' SelectedResponse
Deficient Encapsulation,Tavis.HttpCache,HttpCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tavis-software_Tavis.PrivateCache\src\HttpCache\HttpCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StoreBasedOnHeuristics' CacheableMethods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tavis.HttpCache,CacheQueryResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tavis-software_Tavis.PrivateCache\src\HttpCache\CacheQueryResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Tavis.HttpCache.CacheQueryResult' Tavis.HttpCache.HttpCache
