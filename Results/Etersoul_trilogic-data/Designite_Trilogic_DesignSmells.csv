Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,Gui,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,IconLoader,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stetic,ActionGroups,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\gtk-gui\generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Trilogic,MainWindow,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,Trilogic,DirectoryAccess,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\Data\DirectoryAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Trilogic.Data,SqlServerAccess,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\Data\SqlServerAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SqlServerAccess[281' 302]' SqlServerAccess[318' 339]
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Trilogic,MainWindow,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainWindow' FolderSelector
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Trilogic,FolderSelector,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\FolderSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FolderSelector' MainWindow' CompareWindow' MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Trilogic,CompareWindow,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\CompareWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CompareWindow' MainWindow
Insufficient Modularization,Trilogic.Data,SqlServerAccess,C:\repos\Etersoul_trilogic-data\src\Trilogic\Data\SqlServerAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 101
