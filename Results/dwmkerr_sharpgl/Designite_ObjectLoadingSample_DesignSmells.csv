Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ObjectLoadingSample,VertexAttributes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\Scene.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' Normal' TexCoord
Unutilized Abstraction,ObjectLoadingSample,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ObjectLoadingSample,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OpenGLControl_Resized which is more interested in members of the type: Scene
Feature Envy,ObjectLoadingSample,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: fileOpenItem_Click which is more interested in members of the type: Scene
Unnecessary Abstraction,ObjectLoadingSample.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,ObjectLoadingSample,Mesh,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\SceneDenormaliser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: vertices' normals' uvs' indices' indicesPerFace' material
Broken Modularization,ObjectLoadingSample,Mesh,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\ObjectLoadingSample\SceneDenormaliser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' vertices' normals' uvs' indices' indicesPerFace' material
