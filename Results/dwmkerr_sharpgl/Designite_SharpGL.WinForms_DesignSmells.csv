Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.Controls,GLColourPicker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\GLColourPicker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.Controls,MaterialListViewItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\MaterialListViewItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SharpGL.Controls,VertexControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\VertexControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateVertex
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.Controls,VertexControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\VertexControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpGL.Controls,VertexControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\VertexControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  VertexControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\VertexControl.cs' [29' 52])' SceneControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\SceneControl.cs' [26' 49])
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.WinForms,IdleTimeManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\IdleTimeManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SharpGL,OpenGLControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\OpenGLControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitialiseOpenGL which is more interested in members of the type: OpenGL
Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpGL,SceneControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WinForms\SceneControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnPaintBackground
