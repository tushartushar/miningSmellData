Deficient Encapsulation,ExtensionsSample,TorusVertex,F:\newReposMay17\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ExtensionsSample\TorusVertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: position' s' t' sTangent' tTangent' normal' tangentSpaceLight
Broken Modularization,ExtensionsSample,TorusVertex,F:\newReposMay17\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ExtensionsSample\TorusVertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' position' s' t' sTangent' tTangent' normal' tangentSpaceLight
