Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.WPF,CollectionCountToVisibilityConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\CollectionCountToVisibilityConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.WPF,SceneView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\SceneView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpGL.WPF,SceneView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\SceneView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SceneView (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\SceneView.xaml.cs' [191' 211])' OpenGLControl (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\OpenGLControl.xaml.cs' [370' 390])
Feature Envy,SharpGL.WPF,OpenGLControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\OpenGLControl.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateOpenGLControl which is more interested in members of the type: OpenGL
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpGL.WPF.SceneTree,SceneTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\SceneTree\SceneTree.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpGL.WPF.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,SharpGL.WPF,SceneView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Core\SharpGL.WPF\SceneView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: DIBSectionRenderContextProvider' FBORenderContextProvider (in method "timer_Tick" of class "SceneView").
