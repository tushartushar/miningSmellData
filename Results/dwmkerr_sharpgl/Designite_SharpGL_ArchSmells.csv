Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,SharpGL,SharpGL,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: SharpGL' SharpGL.RenderContextProviders
Unstable Dependency,SharpGL,SharpGL,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): SharpGL.RenderContextProviders
God Component,SharpGL,SharpGL.Enumerations,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 33
Feature Concentration,SharpGL,SharpGL.Enumerations,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AccumOperation]' [AlphaTestFunction]' [AttributeMask]' [BeginMode]' [BlendingDestinationFactor]' [BlendingSourceFactor]' [ClipPlaneName]' [FaceMode]' [DataType]' [DepthFunction]' [DrawBufferMode]' [ErrorCode]' [FeedbackMode]' [FeedbackToken]' [FogMode]' [GetMapTarget]' [GetTarget]' [FrontFaceMode]' [HintMode]' [HintTarget]' [LightName]' [LightParameter]' [LightModelParameter]' [LogicOp]' [MatrixMode]' [PixelTransferParameterName]' [PolygonMode]' [RenderingMode]' [ShadeModel]' [StencilFunction]' [StencilOperation]' [TextureParameter]' [TextureTarget]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
