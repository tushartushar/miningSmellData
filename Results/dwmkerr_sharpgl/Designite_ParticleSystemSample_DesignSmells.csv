Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ParticleSystemSample,FormParticleSystemSample,F:\newReposMay17\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ParticleSystemSample\FormParticleSystemSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadGLTextures
Unutilized Abstraction,ParticleSystemSample,FormParticleSystemSample,F:\newReposMay17\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ParticleSystemSample\FormParticleSystemSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ParticleSystemSample,FormParticleSystemSample,F:\newReposMay17\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ParticleSystemSample\FormParticleSystemSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FormParticleSystemSample[21' 62]' FormParticleSystemSample[221' 262]
Unnecessary Abstraction,ParticleSystemSample.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ParticleSystemSample\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
