Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleShaderSample,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\SimpleShaderSample\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SimpleShaderSample,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\SimpleShaderSample\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OpenGLControl_OpenGLInitialized which is more interested in members of the type: ShaderProgram
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleShaderSample.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WPF\SimpleShaderSample\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
