Feature Envy,ModernOpenGLSample,Scene,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dwmkerr_sharpgl\source\SharpGL\Samples\WinForms\ModernOpenGLSample\Scene.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateVerticesForSquare which is more interested in members of the type: VertexBufferArray
