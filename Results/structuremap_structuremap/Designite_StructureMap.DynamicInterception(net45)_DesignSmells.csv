Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,StructureMap.DynamicInterception,IArgument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception\IArgument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' ParameterInfo' InstanceParameterInfo
Unnecessary Abstraction,StructureMap.DynamicInterception,IInterceptionBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception\IInterceptionBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unexploited Encapsulation,StructureMap.DynamicInterception,DynamicProxyInterceptor<TPluginType>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception\DynamicProxyInterceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ISyncInterceptionBehavior' IAsyncInterceptionBehavior (in method "wrapInterceptors" of class "DynamicProxyInterceptor<TPluginType>").
