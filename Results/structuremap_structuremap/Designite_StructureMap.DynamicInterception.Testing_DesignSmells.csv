Unutilized Abstraction,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,MethodInvocationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\MethodInvocationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,FilterAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\MethodInvocationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,RetryInterceptorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\RetryInterceptorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 41 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,BusyService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\DynamicProxyInterceptorAcceptanceTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DoNothing
Rebellious Hierarchy,StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing,ThrowingService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.DynamicInterception.Testing\MethodInvocationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Throw' ThrowAsync
