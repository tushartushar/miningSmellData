Unnecessary Abstraction,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,DefaultRule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\DefaultRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,Cow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\EnumerationCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,SetterTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\EnumerationCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Name2' Age' Breed

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,Widget2Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\Widget2Color.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,Widget2Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\Widget2Color.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,Cow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\EnumerationCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Breed' Name' Weight
Broken Hierarchy,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,DefaultRule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\DefaultRule.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StructureMap.Testing.Widget.Rule
Broken Hierarchy,StructureMap.Testing.Widget2,Rule1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\structuremap_structuremap\src\StructureMap.Testing.Widget2\Rule1.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StructureMap.Testing.Widget.Rule
