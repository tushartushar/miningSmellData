Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,PdfViewer,CustomScrollControl,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\CustomScrollControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CustomScrollControl[620' 647]' PanningZoomingScrollControl[130' 157]
Multifaceted Abstraction,PdfViewer,NativeMethods,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Duplicate Abstraction,PdfViewer,PdfDocument,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\PdfDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: PdfViewer.PdfDocument' PdfViewer.Chrome.PdfDocument' PdfViewer.XPdf.PdfDocument
Imperative Abstraction,PdfViewer,PdfRenderer,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\PdfRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Load
Insufficient Modularization,PdfViewer,CustomScrollControl,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\CustomScrollControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 173
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PdfViewer,PdfDocument,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\PdfDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PdfDocument' PdfPrintDocument
Cyclic Hierarchy,PdfViewer.Chrome,PdfFile,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\Chrome\PdfFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PdfBufferFile
Cyclic Hierarchy,PdfViewer.Chrome,PdfFile,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\Chrome\PdfFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PdfMemoryStreamFile
Cyclic Hierarchy,PdfViewer.Chrome,PdfFile,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\Chrome\PdfFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PdfFileStreamFile
Unfactored Hierarchy,PdfViewer.Chrome,PdfFileStreamFile,D:\newReposJune17\pvginkel_PdfViewer\PdfViewer\Chrome\PdfFileStreamFile.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: PdfFileStreamFile[38' 57]' PdfMemoryStreamFile[55' 74]
