Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,FdbTop,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Duplicate Abstraction,FdbTop,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs' [1' 28])' RingBuffer<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\RingBuffer.cs' [1' 28])
Deficient Encapsulation,FdbTop,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ScreenHeight' ScreenWidth' CurrentCoordinators
Deficient Encapsulation,FdbTop,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ScreenHeight' ScreenWidth' CurrentCoordinators
Deficient Encapsulation,FdbTop,Texel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value
Deficient Encapsulation,FdbTop,RoleMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Master' ClusterController' Proxy' Log' Storage' Resolver' Other
Insufficient Modularization,FdbTop,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FdbTop,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Broken Modularization,FdbTop,HistoryMetric,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FdbTop\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Available' LocalTime' ReadVersion' Timestamp' ReadsPerSecond' WritesPerSecond' WrittenBytesPerSecond' TransStarted' TransCommitted' TransConflicted' LatencyCommit' LatencyRead' LatencyStart
