Imperative Abstraction,FoundationDB.Samples.Benchmarks,SamplerTest,C:\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FoundationDB.Samples\Utils\Sampler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Duplicate Abstraction,FoundationDB.Samples,PerfCounters,C:\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FoundationDB.Samples\PerfCounters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PerfCounters (C:\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FoundationDB.Samples\PerfCounters.cs' [1' 20])' IAsyncTest (C:\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FoundationDB.Samples\Program.cs' [1' 20])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FoundationDB.Samples.Benchmarks,BenchRunner,C:\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FoundationDB.Samples\Benchmarks\BenchRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FoundationDB.Samples.Benchmarks.BenchRunner' FoundationDB.Samples.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FoundationDB.Samples,Program,C:\repos\Doxense_foundationdb-dotnet-client\FoundationDB.Samples\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
