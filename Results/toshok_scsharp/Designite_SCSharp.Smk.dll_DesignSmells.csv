Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,SCSharp.Smk,SmackerFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\toshok_scsharp\SCSharp\SCSharp.Mpq.Smk\Smk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OpenFromStream
Feature Envy,SCSharp.Smk,SmackerDecoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\toshok_scsharp\SCSharp\SCSharp.Mpq.Smk\SmkDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Reset which is more interested in members of the type: SmackerFile
Deficient Encapsulation,SCSharp.Smk,Node,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\toshok_scsharp\SCSharp\SCSharp.Mpq.Smk\Huffmantree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: isLeaf
Deficient Encapsulation,SCSharp.Smk,SmackerHeader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\toshok_scsharp\SCSharp\SCSharp.Mpq.Smk\Smk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Signature' Width' Height' NbFrames' Pts_Inc' Fps' Flags' AudioSize' TreesSize' NMap_Size' MClr_Size' Full_Size' Type_Size' AudioRate' Dummy
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SCSharp.Smk,SmackerFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\toshok_scsharp\SCSharp\SCSharp.Mpq.Smk\Smk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SCSharp.Smk.SmackerFile' SCSharp.Smk.SmackerDecoder
