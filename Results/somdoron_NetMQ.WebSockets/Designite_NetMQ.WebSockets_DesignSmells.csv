Unutilized Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,ArrayExtensions,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\ArrayExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,BaseShimHandler,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\BaseShimHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unutilized Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,BaseShimHandler,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\BaseShimHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,PublisherShimHandler,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,WSSocketEventArgs,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,Decoder,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\Decoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Process
Unutilized Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,Message,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NetMQ.WebSockets,RouterShimHandler,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSRouter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NetMQ.WebSockets,WSSocket,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ReceiveReady
Broken Hierarchy,NetMQ.WebSockets,WSPublisher,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSPublisher.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NetMQ.WebSockets.WSSocket
Broken Hierarchy,NetMQ.WebSockets,WSRouter,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSRouter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NetMQ.WebSockets.WSSocket
Rebellious Hierarchy,NetMQ.WebSockets,RouterShimHandler,C:\repos\somdoron_NetMQ.WebSockets\src\NetMQ.WebSockets\WSRouter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnNewClient' OnClientRemoved
