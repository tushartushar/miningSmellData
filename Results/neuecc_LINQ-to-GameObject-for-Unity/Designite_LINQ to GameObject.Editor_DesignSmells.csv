Unutilized Abstraction,NUnit.Framework,AssertEx,C:\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-GameObject-for-Unity\Assets\Editor\ChainingAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NUnit.Framework,ComparisonComparer<T>,C:\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-GameObject-for-Unity\Assets\Editor\ChainingAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NUnit.Framework,EqualInfo,C:\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-GameObject-for-Unity\Assets\Editor\ChainingAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Right' IsEquals' Names
Unutilized Abstraction,Assets.Editor,Menu,C:\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-GameObject-for-Unity\Assets\Editor\Menu.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Deficient Encapsulation,NUnit.Framework,EqualInfo,C:\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-GameObject-for-Unity\Assets\Editor\ChainingAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Left' Right' IsEquals' Names
Insufficient Modularization,NUnit.Framework,AssertEx,C:\repos\neuecc_LINQ-to-GameObject-for-Unity\Assets\Editor\ChainingAssertion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
