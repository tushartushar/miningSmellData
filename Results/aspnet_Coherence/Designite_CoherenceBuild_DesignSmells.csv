Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CoherenceBuild,CIVolatileFeedPublisher,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\CIVolatileFeedPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,CoherenceBuild,CoherenceBuild,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\CoherenceBuild.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Imperative Abstraction,CoherenceBuild,CoherenceVerifier,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\CoherenceVerifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: VerifyAll
Unnecessary Abstraction,CoherenceBuild,DependencyWithIssue,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\DependencyWithIssue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Dependency' Info' TargetFramework
Unutilized Abstraction,CoherenceBuild,DependencyWithIssue,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\DependencyWithIssue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CoherenceBuild,CoherenceBuild,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\CoherenceBuild.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CoherenceBuild.CoherenceBuild' CoherenceBuild.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CoherenceBuild,Program,C:\repos\aspnet_Coherence\tools\CoherenceBuild\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CoherenceBuild.Program' CoherenceBuild.CoherenceBuild
