Unutilized Abstraction,BundlerMiddleware,BundlerMarkdownExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMarkdown\BundlerMarkdown.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MarkdownSharp,Markdown,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMarkdown\markdownsharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Transform
Deficient Encapsulation,MarkdownSharp,Token,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMarkdown\markdownsharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type' Value
Broken Modularization,MarkdownSharp,MarkdownOptions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMarkdown\markdownsharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AutoHyperlink' AutoNewlines' EmptyElementSuffix' EncodeProblemUrlCharacters' LinkEmails' StrictBoldItalic
Insufficient Modularization,MarkdownSharp,Markdown,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMarkdown\markdownsharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 63 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MarkdownSharp,Markdown,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMarkdown\markdownsharp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 125
