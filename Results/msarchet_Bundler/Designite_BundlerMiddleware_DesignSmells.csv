Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,BundlerMiddleware,BundlerMiddleware,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\BundlerMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BundlerMiddleware which is more interested in members of the type: BundleMatcher
Unnecessary Abstraction,BundlerMiddleware,BundlerRoutes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\BundlerRouteTables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Routes
Unutilized Abstraction,BundlerMiddleware,BundlerRoutes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\BundlerRouteTables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BundlerMiddleware,Matchers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\Replacer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ContentMatcher
Unutilized Abstraction,BundlerMiddleware,Matchers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\Replacer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BundlerMiddleware,ReplacementPair,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\Replacer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Regex' Replacement
Deficient Encapsulation,BundlerMiddleware,BundlerRoutes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\BundlerRouteTables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Routes
Deficient Encapsulation,BundlerMiddleware,BundlerRoutes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\msarchet_Bundler\BundlerMiddleware\BundlerRouteTables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Routes
