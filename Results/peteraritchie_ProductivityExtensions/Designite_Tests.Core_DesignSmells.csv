Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests.Core,InstanceClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteraritchie_ProductivityExtensions\src\Tests.Core\TypeableTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,Tests.Core,TemporableTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\peteraritchie_ProductivityExtensions\src\Tests.Core\TemporableTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
