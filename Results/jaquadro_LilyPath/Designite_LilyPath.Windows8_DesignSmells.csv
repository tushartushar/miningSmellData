Imperative Abstraction,LilyPath,Brush,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Brush.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,LilyPath,DrawBatch,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,LilyPath,DrawBatch,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Duplicate Abstraction,LilyPath,DrawBatch,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DrawBatch (C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs' [1651' 1685])' PathBuilder (C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\PathBuilder.cs' [639' 673])
Unnecessary Abstraction,LilyPath,DrawingInfo,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Texture' Primitive' IndexCount' VertexCount
Imperative Abstraction,LilyPath,Pen,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Pen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,LilyPath.Utility,MicroBuffer<T>,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Utility\Buffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LilyPath.Utility,Pools<T>,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Utility\Pools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,LilyPath,DrawingInfo,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Texture' Primitive' IndexCount' VertexCount
Deficient Encapsulation,LilyPath.Utility,JoinSample,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Utility\PenWorkspace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PointA' PointB' PointC' LengthA' LengthB' LengthC
Deficient Encapsulation,LilyPath.Utility,PenWorkspace,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Utility\PenWorkspace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: XYBuffer' XYInsetBuffer' XYOutsetBuffer' UVBuffer' UVInsetBuffer' UVOutsetBuffer' IndexBuffer' OutlineIndexBuffer' BoundingQuad
Insufficient Modularization,LilyPath,DrawBatch,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 88 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LilyPath,DrawBatch,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 118 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LilyPath,DrawBatch,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\DrawBatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 288
Broken Modularization,LilyPath,IGraphicsPath,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\GraphicsPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VertexCount' IndexCount' VertexPositionData' VertexTextureData' VertexColorData' IndexData' Pen
Insufficient Modularization,LilyPath,PathBuilder,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\PathBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LilyPath,PathBuilder,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\PathBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LilyPath,PathBuilder,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\PathBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LilyPath,Pen,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Pen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LilyPath.Pen' LilyPath.Utility.PenWorkspace
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LilyPath.Utility,PenWorkspace,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Utility\PenWorkspace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LilyPath.Utility.PenWorkspace' LilyPath.Pen
Broken Hierarchy,LilyPath,PrimitivePen,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\Pen.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LilyPath.Pen
Broken Hierarchy,LilyPath,SolidColorBrush,C:\repos\jaquadro_LilyPath\LilyPath\SolidColorBrush.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LilyPath.Brush
