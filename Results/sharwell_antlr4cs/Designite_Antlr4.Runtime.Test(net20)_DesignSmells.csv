Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\BaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,ParserTestOptions<TParser>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\ParserTestOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Parser' ParserStartRule' Debug
Unutilized Abstraction,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestBitSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestBitSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestGraphNodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestGraphNodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestIntervalSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestIntervalSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,ParserFactory_1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestPerformance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: parseFile
Deficient Encapsulation,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,BaseTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\BaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tmpdir
Deficient Encapsulation,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,DescriptiveErrorListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestPerformance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: INSTANCE
Deficient Encapsulation,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,DescriptiveErrorListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestPerformance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: INSTANCE
Broken Modularization,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,LexerTestOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\LexerTestOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestName' Lexer' Input' ExpectedOutput' ExpectedErrors' ShowDFA
Insufficient Modularization,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestGraphNodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestGraphNodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 41 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestGraphNodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestGraphNodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestIntervalSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestIntervalSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TestIntervalSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestIntervalSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,TreeShapeListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\BaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExitEveryRule' VisitErrorNode' VisitTerminal
Missing Hierarchy,Antlr4.Runtime.Test,ParserFactory_1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharwell_antlr4cs\runtime\CSharp\Antlr4.Runtime.Test\TestPerformance.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ParseCanceledException' ParseCanceledException (in method "parseFile" of class "ParserFactory_1").
