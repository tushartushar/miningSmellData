Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ProtocolLibrary.CCProtocol,CCCommunicateClass,C:\repos\mtysgithub_LAN_Communication_Framework\ProtocolLibrary\CCProtocol\CommunicateClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateSpecializationSerializeTypeSet
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProtocolLibrary.CSProtocol.CommonConfig,ConstData,C:\repos\mtysgithub_LAN_Communication_Framework\ProtocolLibrary\CSProtocol\CommonConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' tokenLength' tokenStringLength' emptyGuidString
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientMsgCodecSpace,GetOnlineGroupsFaildCodec,C:\repos\mtysgithub_LAN_Communication_Framework\ProtocolLibrary\CSProtocol\CommonConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClientMsgCodecSpace,ClientCancleFaildCodec,C:\repos\mtysgithub_LAN_Communication_Framework\ProtocolLibrary\CSProtocol\CommonConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CSProtocol,ICSSerializeOperat,C:\repos\mtysgithub_LAN_Communication_Framework\ProtocolLibrary\ICSSerializeOperat.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexloited Encapsulation,ProtocolLibrary.CSProtocol,MyUnderScsWireProtocol,C:\repos\mtysgithub_LAN_Communication_Framework\ProtocolLibrary\CSProtocol\MyUnderScsWireProtocol.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ScsRawDataMessage' ScsTextMessage (in method "SerializeMessage" of class "MyUnderScsWireProtocol").
