Unutilized Abstraction,GitHubAPI.IntegrationTests.Authentication,BasicAuthenticationTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgrassie_csharp-github-api\csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests\Authentication\BasicAuthenticationTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitHubAPI.IntegrationTests,HeaderProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgrassie_csharp-github-api\csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests\HeaderProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,GitHubAPI.IntegrationTests,HeaderProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgrassie_csharp-github-api\csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests\HeaderProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
