Imperative Abstraction,PerformanceTests,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikaelEliasson_EntityFramework.Utilities\EntityFramework.Utilities\PerformanceTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,PerformanceTests,Publication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikaelEliasson_EntityFramework.Utilities\EntityFramework.Utilities\PerformanceTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Title' Comments
Unnecessary Abstraction,PerformanceTests,Address,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikaelEliasson_EntityFramework.Utilities\EntityFramework.Utilities\PerformanceTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Line1' ZipCode' Town
Broken Modularization,PerformanceTests,Comment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikaelEliasson_EntityFramework.Utilities\EntityFramework.Utilities\PerformanceTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Text' Date' Reads' Address' PublicationId' Publication
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PerformanceTests,Comment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MikaelEliasson_EntityFramework.Utilities\EntityFramework.Utilities\PerformanceTests\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PerformanceTests.Comment' PerformanceTests.Publication
