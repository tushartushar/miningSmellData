Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,RemoteMon,AddServer,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\AddServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetAlerts
Duplicate Abstraction,RemoteMon,AddServer,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\AddServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AddServer[26' 52]' AddServer[97' 123]
Unutilized Abstraction,RemoteMon,DataGridViewGraphColumn,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\DataGridViewGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,RemoteMon,DataGridViewGraphCell,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\DataGridViewGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83
Unutilized Abstraction,RemoteMon,Logger_GARBAGE,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,RemoteMon,NetworkMonitor,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\NetworkMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RepopulateSelServerResult
Multifaceted Abstraction,RemoteMon,NetworkMonitor,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\NetworkMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.96
Insufficient Modularization,RemoteMon,AddServer,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\AddServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 232
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RemoteMon,AddServer,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\AddServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AddServer' NetworkMonitor
Insufficient Modularization,RemoteMon,NetworkMonitor,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\NetworkMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 62 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RemoteMon,NetworkMonitor,C:\repos\fronn_win-net-mon\WinNetMon\RemoteMon\NetworkMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 390
