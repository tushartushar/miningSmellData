Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,sfml-graphics,SFML.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: SFML.Graphics' SFML.Graphics.Glsl,SFML.Graphics.CircleShape' SFML.Graphics.Font' SFML.Graphics.Shader' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Vec2' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Vec4
Unstable Dependency,sfml-graphics,SFML.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): SFML.Graphics.Glsl,SFML.Graphics.Vec2' SFML.Graphics.Vec3' SFML.Graphics.Vec4' SFML.Graphics.Ivec2' SFML.Graphics.Ivec3' SFML.Graphics.Ivec4' SFML.Graphics.Bvec2' SFML.Graphics.Bvec3' SFML.Graphics.Bvec4' SFML.Graphics.Mat3' SFML.Graphics.Mat4
God Component,sfml-graphics,SFML.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 33,SFML.Graphics.Factor' SFML.Graphics.Equation' SFML.Graphics.Info' SFML.Graphics.InfoMarshalData
Feature Concentration,sfml-graphics,SFML.Graphics.Glsl,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Vec2]' [Ivec2]' [Bvec2]' [Vec3]' [Ivec3]' [Bvec3]' [Vec4]' [Ivec4]' [Bvec4]' [Mat3]' [Mat4]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Ivec2' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Bvec2' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Vec3' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Ivec3' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Bvec3' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Vec4' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Ivec4' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Bvec4' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Mat3' SFML.Graphics.Glsl.Mat4
Scattered Functionality,sfml-graphics,SFML.Graphics,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: SFML.Window' SFML,SFML.Window.Context' SFML.ObjectBase' SFML.Window.StreamAdaptor
