Unutilized Abstraction,SFML.Audio,Listener,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\Audio\Listener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SFML.Audio,SoundStream,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\Audio\SoundStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SFML.Audio,Chunk,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\Audio\SoundStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' samples' sampleCount
Deficient Encapsulation,SFML.Audio,Chunk,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\Audio\SoundStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: samples' sampleCount
Insufficient Modularization,SFML.Audio,Music,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\Audio\Music.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SFML.Audio,Sound,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\Audio\Sound.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
