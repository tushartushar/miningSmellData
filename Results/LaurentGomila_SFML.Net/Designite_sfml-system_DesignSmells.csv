Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SFML.System,Vector2f,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Vector2f (C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs' [164' 187])' Vector2f (C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs' [370' 393])' Vector2f (C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs' [564' 587])
Deficient Encapsulation,SFML.System,Vector2f,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,SFML.System,Vector2i,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,SFML.System,Vector2u,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,SFML.System,Vector3f,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\Vector3.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' Z
Wide Hierarchy,SFML,ObjectBase,C:\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\System\ObjectBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: SFML.Audio.Music' SFML.Audio.Sound' SFML.Audio.SoundBuffer' SFML.Audio.SoundRecorder' SFML.Audio.SoundStream' SFML.Graphics.Font' SFML.Graphics.Image' SFML.Graphics.RenderTexture' SFML.Graphics.Shader' SFML.Graphics.Texture' SFML.Graphics.Transformable' SFML.Graphics.VertexArray' SFML.Graphics.View' SFML.System.Clock' SFML.Window.Window
