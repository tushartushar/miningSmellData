Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SFML.Audio,Listener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\Listener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SFML.Audio,TimeSpan,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\Music.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' offset' length
Unnecessary Abstraction,SFML.Audio,Chunk,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\SoundStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' samples' sampleCount
Deficient Encapsulation,SFML.Audio,Chunk,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\SoundStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: samples' sampleCount
Insufficient Modularization,SFML.Audio,Music,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\Music.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SFML.Audio,Sound,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\Sound.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SFML.Audio,SoundStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LaurentGomila_SFML.Net\src\SFML.Audio\SoundStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
