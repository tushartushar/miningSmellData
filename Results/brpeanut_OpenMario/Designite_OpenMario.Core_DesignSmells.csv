Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenMario.Core.Engine,FrameEventArgs,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Engine\FrameEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Frame
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenMario.Core.Extensions,DrawingExtensions,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Extensions\DrawingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Multifaceted Abstraction,OpenMario.Core.Physics,Physics,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Physics\Physics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenMario.Core.Players.Actions,KeyEventArgs,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Players\Actions\KeyEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: KeyMapping
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors,BaseActor,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\BaseActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseActor' Environment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors,BaseActor,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\BaseActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseActor' Mario' Environment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors,BaseActor,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\BaseActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseActor' Environment' Engine' Environment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors,BaseActor,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\BaseActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BaseActor' Mario' Environment' Engine' Environment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors.Concrete,Mario,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\Concrete\Mario.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mario' Environment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors.Concrete,Mario,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\Concrete\Mario.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mario' Environment' BaseActor' MarioSpriteManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Actors.Sprites,SpriteManager,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\Sprites\SpriteManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SpriteManager' Mario' Environment' BaseActor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Engine,Engine,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Engine\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Engine' Environment
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenMario.Core.Physics,Physics,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Physics\Physics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Physics' Mario' Environment' BaseActor
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenMario.Core.Actors,GravityActor,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\GravityActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Load' Draw
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenMario.Core.Actors,MovementActor,C:\repos\brpeanut_OpenMario\OpenMario.Core\Actors\MovementActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
