Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,g,DbTools,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\DbTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,g,HttpUtility,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\HttpUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,g.config,Config,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\config\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,g.forms,OwnerDrawList,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\forms\OwnerDrawList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: EnsureVisible
Unutilized Abstraction,g.forms,OwnerDrawList,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\forms\OwnerDrawList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,g.forms,SingleApp,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\forms\SingleApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Iesi.Collections,ISet,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\Iesi\ISet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ISet[9' 29]' Set[11' 31]
Unnecessary Abstraction,g.orm,Key,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\orm\Key.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Values
Unutilized Abstraction,g.orm,TypedMapper,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\orm\TypedMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Iesi.Collections,Set,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\Iesi\Set.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclic Hierarchy,Iesi.Collections,DictionarySet,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\Iesi\DictionarySet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: HybridSet
Broken Hierarchy,Iesi.Collections,HashedSet,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\Iesi\HashedSet.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DictionarySet
Broken Hierarchy,Iesi.Collections,HybridSet,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\Iesi\HybridSet.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DictionarySet
Rebellious Hierarchy,Iesi.Collections,Set,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\Iesi\Set.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Add' Clear' Contains' Remove' GetHashCode
Rebellious Hierarchy,g.orm.impl,AbstractSqlMapper,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\orm\impl\AbstractSqlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: createKey
Broken Hierarchy,g.orm.impl,DateKey,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\orm\impl\DateKey.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractKey
Broken Hierarchy,g.orm.impl,IntKey,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\orm\impl\IntKey.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractKey
Broken Hierarchy,g.orm.impl,ObjectsList,C:\repos\agushuley_kmhl\g\orm\impl\ObjectsList.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectsCollection
