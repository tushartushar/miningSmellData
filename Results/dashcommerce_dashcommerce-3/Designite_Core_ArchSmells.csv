Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,Core,MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core.Caching,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core.Caching.Manager
Unstable Dependency,Core,MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Store' MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core.Caching
Unstable Dependency,Core,MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Store,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core.Configuration
Feature Concentration,Core,MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConfigurationDatumController' ConfigurationDatumCollection' ConfigurationDatum' Validator' PublicResources]' [CountryController' CountryCollection' Country' StateOrRegionCollection' StateOrRegion' StateOrRegionController]' [LogController' LogCollection' Log' SPs' Logger]' [ImageProcess]' [CoreUtility]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.28
Scattered Functionality,Core,MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core' MettleSystems.dashCommerce.Core.Serialization
