Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,LastPass,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\detunized_lastpass-sharp\src\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LastPass,Vault,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\detunized_lastpass-sharp\src\Vault.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LastPass,WebClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\detunized_lastpass-sharp\src\WebClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,LastPass,ParserHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\detunized_lastpass-sharp\src\ParserHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LastPass,Asn1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\detunized_lastpass-sharp\src\Asn1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LastPass.Asn1' LastPass.ParserHelper
