Multifaceted Abstraction,BlobPrototype001,MainWindow,C:\repos\jaelle_blob\viewer\BlobPrototype001\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,BlobPrototype001,MainWindow,C:\repos\jaelle_blob\viewer\BlobPrototype001\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BlobPrototype001.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\jaelle_blob\viewer\BlobPrototype001\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,BlobPrototype001,MainWindow,C:\repos\jaelle_blob\viewer\BlobPrototype001\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Insufficient Modularization,BlobPrototype001,MainWindow,C:\repos\jaelle_blob\viewer\BlobPrototype001\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 157
