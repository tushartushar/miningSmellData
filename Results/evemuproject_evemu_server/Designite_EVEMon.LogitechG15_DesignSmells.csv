Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Format
Unnecessary Abstraction,lgLcdClassLibrary,lgLcdBitmap160x43x1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\LCDInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' hdr' pixels
Unnecessary Abstraction,lgLcdClassLibrary,lgLcdConfigureContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\LCDInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' configCallback' configContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,lgLcdClassLibrary,lgLcdConnectContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\LCDInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' appFriendlyName' isPersistent' isAutostartable' onConfigure' connection
Unnecessary Abstraction,lgLcdClassLibrary,lgLcdSoftbuttonsChangedContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\LCDInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' softbuttonsChangedCallback' softbuttonsChangedContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,lgLcdClassLibrary,lgLcdOpenContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\LCDInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' connection' index' onSoftbuttonsChanged' device
Insufficient Modularization,EVEMon.LogitechG15,Lcdisplay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\Lcdisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Modularization,lgLcdClassLibrary,lgLcdConnectContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\LCDInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' appFriendlyName' isPersistent' isAutostartable' onConfigure' connection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EVEMon.LogitechG15,Lcdisplay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\Lcdisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EVEMon.LogitechG15.Lcdisplay' EVEMon.LogitechG15.LineProcess
