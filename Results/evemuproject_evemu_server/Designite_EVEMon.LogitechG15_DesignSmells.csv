Imperative Abstraction,EVEMon.LogitechG15,G15Handler,F:\newReposMay17\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\G15Handler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialize
Insufficient Modularization,EVEMon.LogitechG15,Lcdisplay,F:\newReposMay17\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\Lcdisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,EVEMon.LogitechG15,Lcdisplay,F:\newReposMay17\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\Lcdisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 101
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EVEMon.LogitechG15,Lcdisplay,F:\newReposMay17\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon.LogitechG15\Lcdisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Lcdisplay' LineProcess
