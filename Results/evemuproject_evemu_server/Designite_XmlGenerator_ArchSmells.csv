Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,XmlGenerator,EVEMon.XmlGenerator.StaticData,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EVEMon.XmlGenerator
Ambiguous Interface,XmlGenerator,EVEMon.XmlGenerator.StaticData,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: DgmTypeAttribute
God Component,XmlGenerator,EVEMon.XmlGenerator,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 88
Feature Concentration,XmlGenerator,EVEMon.XmlGenerator.StaticData,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AgtAgents]' [EveNames]' [InvBlueprintTypes]' [InvTypeMaterials]' [RamTypeRequirements]' [CrtCategories]' [CrtCertificates]' [CrtClasses]' [CrtRecommendations]' [CrtRelationships]' [DgmAttributeTypes]' [DgmAttributeCategory]' [DgmTypeAttribute]' [DgmTypeEffect]' [EveIcons]' [EveUnit]' [InvGroup]' [InvMarketGroup]' [InvMetaType]' [InvType]' [MapConstellation]' [MapRegion]' [MapSolarSystem]' [MapSolarSystemJump]' [StaStation]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.92  All the dependencies among components: from: EVEMon.XmlGenerator' to: EVEMon.XmlGenerator.StaticData' from: EVEMon.XmlGenerator' to: EVEMon.Common.Serialization.Datafiles' from:
