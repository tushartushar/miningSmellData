Missing Hierarchy,EVEMon.SkillPlanner,PlanEditorControl,F:\newReposMay17\evemuproject_evemu_server\utils\playertools\evemon\src\EVEMon\SkillPlanner\PlanEditorControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: PlanEntry' RemappingPoint (in method "lvSkills_ItemHover" of class "PlanEditorControl").
