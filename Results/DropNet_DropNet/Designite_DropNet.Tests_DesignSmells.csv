Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DropNet.Tests,FileTaskTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\FileTaskTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropNet.Tests,FileTests_Sandbox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\FileTests1.Sandbox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropNet.Tests,FileAsyncTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\FileAsyncTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropNet.Tests,FileSyncTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\FileSyncTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,DropNet.Tests,FileSyncTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\FileSyncTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_Delete_File which is more interested in members of the type: DropNetClient
Unutilized Abstraction,DropNet.Tests,RequestHelperTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\Helpers\RequestHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropNet.Tests,UserTests1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\UserTests1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,DropNet.Tests,UserTests1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\UserTests1.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Can_Get_AccountInfo which is more interested in members of the type: DropNetClient
Deficient Encapsulation,DropNet.Tests,TestVariables,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\TestVariables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ApiKey' ApiSecret' ApiKey_Sandbox' ApiSecret_Sandbox' Email' Password' Token' Secret' Token_Sandbox' Secret_Sandbox
Deficient Encapsulation,DropNet.Tests,TestVariables,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\TestVariables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ApiKey' ApiSecret' ApiKey_Sandbox' ApiSecret_Sandbox' Email' Password' Token' Secret' Token_Sandbox' Secret_Sandbox
Insufficient Modularization,DropNet.Tests,FileSyncTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\FileSyncTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,DropNet.Tests,TestVariables,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DropNet_DropNet\DropNet.Tests\TestVariables.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ApiKey' ApiSecret' ApiKey_Sandbox' ApiSecret_Sandbox' Email' Password' Token' Secret' Token_Sandbox' Secret_Sandbox
