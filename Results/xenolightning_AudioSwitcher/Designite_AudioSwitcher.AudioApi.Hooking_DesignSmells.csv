Unnecessary Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Hooking.ComObjects,ComIIds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Hooking\ComObjects\ComIIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UNKNOWN_IID' IMM_DEVICE_IID' IMM_DEVICE_ENUMERATOR_IID' DEVICE_ENUMERATOR_CID' POLICY_CONFIG_CID
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Hooking,EntryPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Hooking\EntryPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Hooking.ComObjects,ComIIds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Hooking\ComObjects\ComIIds.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
