Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests,AsyncBroadcasterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests\AsyncBroadcasterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests,DeviceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests\DeviceTests.Async.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests,BroadcasterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests\BroadcasterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests.Stubs,DeviceStub,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Tests\Stubs\DeviceStub.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Device
