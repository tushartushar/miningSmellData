Unnecessary Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,IDeviceCapability,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\IDeviceCapability.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Observables,AsyncBroadcaster<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\Observables\AsyncBroadcaster.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Observables,Disposable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\Observables\Disposable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Empty
Unnecessary Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Observables,IBroadcaster,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\Observables\IBroadcaster.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Observables,ObservableExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\Observables\ObservableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.Sandbox,SandboxDevice,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\Sandbox\SandboxDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fullName' icon' iconPath' id' interfaceName' isMuted' name' state' type' volume
Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,AudioController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\AudioController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,AudioController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\AudioController.Generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,AudioController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\AudioController.Generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,IAudioController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\IAudioController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,AudioController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\AudioController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetDevice' GetDevice' GetDefaultDevice' GetDevices' GetPlaybackDevices' GetPlaybackDevices' GetCaptureDevices' GetCaptureDevices
Rebellious Hierarchy,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,AudioController<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\AudioController.Generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetDevice' GetDefaultDevice' GetDevices
Rebellious Hierarchy,AudioSwitcher.AudioApi,Device,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenolightning_AudioSwitcher\AudioSwitcher.AudioApi\Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetAsDefault' SetAsDefaultAsync' SetAsDefaultCommunications' SetAsDefaultCommunicationsAsync' SetMuteAsync' GetVolumeAsync' SetVolumeAsync' HasCapability' GetCapability' GetAllCapabilities
