Unutilized Abstraction,MatterHackers.MatterControl.Plugins.BrailleBuilder,BrailleBuilderMainWindow,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterControl\BrailleBuilder\BrailleBuilderMainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MatterHackers.MatterControl.Plugins.BrailleBuilder,View3DBrailleBuilder,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterControl\BrailleBuilder\View3DBrailleBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnDraw
Unnecessary Abstraction,MatterHackers.MatterControl.Plugins.BrailleBuilder,MeshSelectInfo,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterControl\BrailleBuilder\View3DBrailleBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' planeDownHitPos' lastMoveDelta
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.MatterControl.Plugins.BrailleBuilder,BrailleGrade2Mapping,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterControl\BrailleBuilder\BrailleGrade2Mapping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: mappingTable
Deficient Encapsulation,MatterHackers.MatterControl.Plugins.BrailleBuilder,BrailleGrade2Mapping,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterControl\BrailleBuilder\BrailleGrade2Mapping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: mappingTable
Insufficient Modularization,MatterHackers.MatterControl.Plugins.BrailleBuilder,View3DBrailleBuilder,C:\repos\MatterHackers_MatterControl\BrailleBuilder\View3DBrailleBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
