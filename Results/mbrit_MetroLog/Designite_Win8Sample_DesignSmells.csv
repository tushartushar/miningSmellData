Unutilized Abstraction,Win8Sample.Common,BindableBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\Common\BindableBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Win8Sample.Common,BooleanNegationConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\Common\BooleanNegationConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Win8Sample.Common,BooleanToVisibilityConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\Common\BooleanToVisibilityConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Win8Sample.Common,RichTextColumns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\Common\RichTextColumns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ResetOverflowLayout
Unutilized Abstraction,Win8Sample.Common,RichTextColumns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\Common\RichTextColumns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Win8Sample.Common,LayoutAwarePage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\Common\LayoutAwarePage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Win8Sample.Common.LayoutAwarePage' Win8Sample.Common.SuspensionManager
Rebellious Hierarchy,Win8Sample,LogSamplePage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\Win8Sample\LogSamplePage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
