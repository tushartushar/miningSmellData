Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,MetroLog,FileTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.NetFx\FileTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetUserAppDataPath
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetroLog,ICanLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\ILogManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MetroLog,LogManagerMixins,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\ILogManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetroLog.Internal,JsonIgnoreAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MetroLog.Targets,LogReadQuery,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Targets\LogReadQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MetroLog.Internal,Logger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\Logger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MetroLog.Internal,JsonObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MetroLog.Internal,SimpleJson,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MetroLog.Internal,SimpleJson,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 280
Insufficient Modularization,MetroLog.Internal,PocoJsonSerializerStrategy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
Insufficient Modularization,Reflection,ReflectionUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Reflection,ReflectionUtils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\SimpleJson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Hierarchy,MetroLog,LoggingEnvironment,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.NetFx\LoggingEnvironment.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MetroLog.Internal.LoggingEnvironmentBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,MetroLog.Internal,LogConfiguratorBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Shared\Internal\LogConfiguratorBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnLogManagerCreated
