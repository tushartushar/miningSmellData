Insufficient Modularization,MetroLog.Tests,LoggerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Tests\Tests\LoggerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MetroLog.Tests,BrokenTarget,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mbrit_MetroLog\MetroLog.Tests\Objects\BrokenTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write
