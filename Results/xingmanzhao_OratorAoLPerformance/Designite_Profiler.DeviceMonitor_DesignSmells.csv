Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceConnection,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectedDevice' ConnectedSocket
Unutilized Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceConnection,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceListener,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceMonitorHelper,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceMonitorHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceMonitorManager,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceMonitorManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,RequestCommands,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\RequestCommands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HOST_TRACK_DEVICES' HOST_VERSION' HOST_TRANSPORT
Unnecessary Abstraction,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,UpdateDevicesEventArgs,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\UpdateDevicesHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Devices
Deficient Encapsulation,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceMonitorHelper,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceMonitorHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DEFAULT_ENCODING
Deficient Encapsulation,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceMonitorHelper,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceMonitorHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DEFAULT_ENCODING
Deficient Encapsulation,Profiler.DeviceMonitor.Models,DeviceMonitorManager,C:\repos\xingmanzhao_OratorAoLPerformance\Profiler.DeviceMonitor\Models\DeviceMonitorManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsRunning
