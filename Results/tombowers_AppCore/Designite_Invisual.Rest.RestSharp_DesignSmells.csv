Broken Hierarchy,Invisual.Rest.RestSharp,BasicHttpAuthRestSharpClient,C:\repos\tombowers_AppCore\Invisual.Rest.RestSharp\BasicHttpAuthRestSharpClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RestSharpClient
Missing Hierarchy,Invisual.Rest.RestSharp,RestSharpClient,C:\repos\tombowers_AppCore\Invisual.Rest.RestSharp\RestSharpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: HttpRequestMethod' RequestParamType (in method "Request" of class "RestSharpClient").
Broken Hierarchy,Invisual.Rest.RestSharp,OAuth2UriQueryParamRestSharpClient,C:\repos\tombowers_AppCore\Invisual.Rest.RestSharp\OAuth2UriQueryParamRestSharpClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RestSharpClient
