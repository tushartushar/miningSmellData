Unutilized Abstraction,DaysUntilXmasiPad,AppDelegate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\AppDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MainViewController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\MainViewController.cs' [471' 497])' FlipsideViewController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\FlipsideViewController.cs' [80' 106])
Feature Envy,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PopulateTimeInformation which is more interested in members of the type: TimeInformation
Feature Envy,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetSocialCountdownString which is more interested in members of the type: TimeInformation
Unutilized Abstraction,DaysUntilXmasiPad,SnowView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\SnowView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DaysUntilXmasiPad,SettingsHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\SettingsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Mute' SelectedSong
Unnecessary Abstraction,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MusicItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\Music.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DefaultOption' Name' Path' Position' _defaultOption
Unutilized Abstraction,DaysUntilXmasiPad,CollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\CollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: musicOption
Deficient Encapsulation,DaysUntilXmasiPad,SnowView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\SnowView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: emitter
Broken Modularization,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MusicItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\Music.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DefaultOption' Name' Path' Position' _defaultOption
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DaysUntilXmasiPad,MainViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\MainViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DaysUntilXmasiPad.MainViewController' DaysUntilXmasiPad.FlipsideViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DaysUntilXmasiPad,AboutViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\AboutViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DaysUntilXmasiPad.AboutViewController' DaysUntilXmasiPad.MainViewController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DaysUntilXmasiPad,FlipsideViewController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisntr_DaysUntilXmas\iOS\DaysUntilXmasiPad\FlipsideViewController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DaysUntilXmasiPad.FlipsideViewController' DaysUntilXmasiPad.MainViewController' DaysUntilXmasiPad.AboutViewController
