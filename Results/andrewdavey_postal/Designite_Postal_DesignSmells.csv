Unnecessary Abstraction,Postal,StubController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\EmailViewRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Postal,EmailViewResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\EmailViewResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Postal,FileSystemRazorViewEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\FileSystemRazorViewEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Postal,FileSystemRazorViewEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\FileSystemRazorViewEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FileSystemRazorViewEngine (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\FileSystemRazorViewEngine.cs' [29' 50])' ResourceRazorViewEngine (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\ResourceRazorViewEngine.cs' [27' 48])
Unutilized Abstraction,Postal,HtmlExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\HtmlExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Postal,ResourceRazorViewEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_postal\src\Postal\ResourceRazorViewEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
