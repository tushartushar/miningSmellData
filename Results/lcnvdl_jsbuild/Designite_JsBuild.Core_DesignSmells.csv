Imperative Abstraction,JsBuild.Core,Configuration,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Load
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JsBuild.Core,Configuration,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Configuration' IWorker
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JsBuild.Core,IWorker,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\IWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IWorker' Configuration' Joiner' Configuration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JsBuild.Core,Joiner,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\Joiner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Joiner' Configuration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JsBuild.Core,Minifier,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\Minifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Minifier' Configuration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,JsBuild.Core,Minifier,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\Minifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Minifier' Configuration' IWorker' Configuration
Rebellious Hierarchy,JsBuild.Core,Minifier,C:\repos\lcnvdl_jsbuild\Project\JsBuild.Core\Minifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Configure' Run
