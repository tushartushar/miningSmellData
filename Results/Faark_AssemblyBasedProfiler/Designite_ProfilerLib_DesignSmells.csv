Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ProfilerLib,Profiler,C:\repos\Faark_AssemblyBasedProfiler\ProfilerLib\Profiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProfilerLib,MethodEventBase,C:\repos\Faark_AssemblyBasedProfiler\ProfilerLib\ProfilingEvents\MehodEventBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' time' threadId
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProfilerLib,IProfilingEvent,C:\repos\Faark_AssemblyBasedProfiler\ProfilerLib\ProfilingEvents\IProfilingEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProfilerLib,ProfilingCallSite,C:\repos\Faark_AssemblyBasedProfiler\ProfilerLib\ProfilingCallSite.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MethodId' NumberOfCalls' RunDuration' SubCalls' Parent
Unutilized Abstraction,ProfilerLib,DictionaryExpands,C:\repos\Faark_AssemblyBasedProfiler\ProfilerLib\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ProfilerLib,CaptureStateEvent,C:\repos\Faark_AssemblyBasedProfiler\ProfilerLib\ProfilingEvents\CaptureStateEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
