Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,IChromosomeOperator,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Chromosomes\IChromosomeOperator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsOrdered
Unutilized Abstraction,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,ChromosomeExtensions,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Chromosomes\ChromosomeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GeneticSharp.Domain.Randomizations,RandomizationExtensions,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Randomizations\RandomizationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GeneticSharp.Domain,IGeneticAlgorithm,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\IGeneticAlgorithm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GenerationsNumber' BestChromosome' TimeEvolving
Wide Hierarchy,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,ChromosomeBase,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Chromosomes\ChromosomeBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.BinaryChromosomeBase' GeneticSharp.Extensions.AutoConfig.AutoConfigChromosome' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Checkers.CheckersChromosome' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Ghostwriter.GhostwriterChromosome' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Mathematic.FunctionBuilderChromosome' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Mathematic.EquationChromosome' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Tsp.TspChromosome' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Drawing.BitmapChromosome' GeneticSharp.Domain.UnitTests.ChromosomeStub' GeneticSharp.Domain.UnitTests.OrderedChromosomeStub
Rebellious Hierarchy,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,ChromosomeBase,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Chromosomes\ChromosomeBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GenerateGene' CreateNew
Rebellious Hierarchy,GeneticSharp.Domain.Populations,TrackingGenerationStrategy,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Populations\TrackingGenerationStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RegisterNewGeneration
Wide Hierarchy,GeneticSharp.Domain.Fitnesses,IFitness,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Fitnesses\IFitness.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: GeneticSharp.Domain.Fitnesses.FuncFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.AutoConfig.AutoConfigFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Checkers.CheckersFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Ghostwriter.GhostwriterFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Mathematic.EqualityFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Mathematic.EquationSolverFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Mathematic.FunctionBuilderFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Tsp.TspFitness' GeneticSharp.Extensions.Drawing.BitmapEqualityFitness' GeneticSharp.Domain.UnitTests.FitnessStub
Rebellious Hierarchy,GeneticSharp.Domain.Randomizations,RandomizationBase,C:\repos\giacomelli_GeneticSharp\src\GeneticSharp.Domain\Randomizations\RandomizationBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetInt' GetFloat' GetDouble
