Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,GeneticSharp.Domain(netstandard2.0),GeneticSharp.Domain,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: GeneticSharp.Domain' GeneticSharp.Domain.Terminations,GeneticSharp.Domain.DefaultOperatorsStrategy' GeneticSharp.Domain.GeneticAlgorithm' GeneticSharp.Domain.Terminations.AndTermination,GeneticSharp.Domain.DefaultOperatorsStrategy' GeneticSharp.Domain.GeneticAlgorithm' GeneticSharp.Domain.Terminations.AndTermination
Unstable Dependency,GeneticSharp.Domain(netstandard2.0),GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): GeneticSharp.Domain.Randomizations,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.RandomizationProvider,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.RandomizationProvider
Unstable Dependency,GeneticSharp.Domain(netstandard2.0),GeneticSharp.Domain,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): GeneticSharp.Domain.Reinsertions' GeneticSharp.Domain.Selections,GeneticSharp.Domain.ElitistReinsertion' GeneticSharp.Domain.IReinsertion' GeneticSharp.Domain.ISelection,GeneticSharp.Domain.ElitistReinsertion' GeneticSharp.Domain.IReinsertion' GeneticSharp.Domain.ISelection
Unstable Dependency,GeneticSharp.Domain(netstandard2.0),GeneticSharp.Domain.Terminations,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): GeneticSharp.Domain,GeneticSharp.Domain.Terminations.IGeneticAlgorithm,GeneticSharp.Domain.Terminations.IGeneticAlgorithm
Feature Concentration,GeneticSharp.Domain(netstandard2.0),GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BinaryChromosomeBase' ChromosomeBase' FloatingPointChromosome' Gene' IBinaryChromosome' IChromosome' IntegerChromosome' ChromosomeExtensions]' [IChromosomeOperator]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IChromosomeOperator,GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.BinaryChromosomeBase' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.ChromosomeBase' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.ChromosomeExtensions' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.FloatingPointChromosome' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.Gene' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IBinaryChromosome' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IChromosome' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IChromosomeOperator' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IntegerChromosome
Scattered Functionality,GeneticSharp.Domain(netstandard2.0),GeneticSharp.Domain.Mutations,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: GeneticSharp.Domain.Randomizations' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes,GeneticSharp.Domain.Randomizations.IRandomization' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IBinaryChromosome' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IChromosome,GeneticSharp.Domain.Randomizations.IRandomization' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IBinaryChromosome' GeneticSharp.Domain.Chromosomes.IChromosome
