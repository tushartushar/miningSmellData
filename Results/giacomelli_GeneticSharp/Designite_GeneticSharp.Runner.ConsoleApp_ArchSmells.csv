Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.94  All the dependencies among components: from: GeneticSharp.Runner.ConsoleApp' to: GeneticSharp.Runner.ConsoleApp.Samples' from: GeneticSharp.Runner.ConsoleApp' to:
