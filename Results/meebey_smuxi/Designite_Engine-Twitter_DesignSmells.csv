Duplicate Abstraction,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterChatType,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TwitterChatType (C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs' [1219' 1238])' TwitterChatType (C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs' [1251' 1270])' TwitterChatType (C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs' [1283' 1302])
Imperative Abstraction,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterSearchStream,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterSearchStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 181
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Smuxi.Engine.TwitterProtocolManager' Smuxi.Engine.TwitterSearchStream
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,TwitterSearchStream,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-Twitter\Protocols\Twitter\TwitterSearchStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Smuxi.Engine.TwitterSearchStream' Smuxi.Engine.TwitterProtocolManager
