Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Smuxi.Engine,IrcProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IrcProtocolManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs' [3102' 3125])' IrcProtocolManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs' [3147' 3170])
Duplicate Abstraction,Smuxi.Engine,IrcPersonModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcPersonModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IrcPersonModel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcPersonModel.cs' [7' 29])' IrcTextColor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcTextColor.cs' [7' 29])
Imperative Abstraction,Smuxi.Engine,IrcMessageBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcMessageBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: AppendMessage
Unexploited Encapsulation,Smuxi.Engine,IrcProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PersonChatModel' GroupChatModel (in method "_Say" of class "IrcProtocolManager").
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,IrcProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 65 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,IrcProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 132 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,IrcProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 526
Broken Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,IrcTextColor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcTextColor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Normal' White' Black' Blue' Green' Red' Brown' Purple' Orange' Yellow' LightGreen' Teal' LightCyan' LightBlue' LightPurple' Grey' LightGrey' _Normal' _White' _Black' _Blue' _Green' _Red' _Brown' _Purple' _Orange' _Yellow' _LightGreen' _Teal' _LightCyan' _LightBlue' _LightPurple' _Grey' _LightGrey
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,IrcProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Smuxi.Engine.IrcProtocolManager' Smuxi.Engine.IrcPersonModel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,IrcGroupPersonModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcGroupPersonModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Smuxi.Engine.IrcGroupPersonModel' Smuxi.Engine.IrcProtocolManager' Smuxi.Engine.IrcPersonModel
Unfactored Hierarchy,Smuxi.Engine,IrcGroupPersonModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcGroupPersonModel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  IrcGroupPersonModel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcGroupPersonModel.cs' [5' 29])' IrcPersonModel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Protocols\Irc\IrcPersonModel.cs' [11' 35])
Broken Hierarchy,Smuxi.Engine,IrcServerModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-IRC\Config\IrcServerModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Smuxi.Engine.ServerModel
