Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Smuxi.Engine,XmppResourceModel,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Config\XmppPersonModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Presence' Disco' Name' NicknameContactKnowsFromMe
Unexploited Encapsulation,Smuxi.Engine,XmppProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Protocols\Xmpp\XmppProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PersonChatModel' XmppGroupChatModel (in method "OnLogin" of class "XmppProtocolManager").
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,XmppProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Protocols\Xmpp\XmppProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,XmppProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Protocols\Xmpp\XmppProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 90 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,XmppProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Protocols\Xmpp\XmppProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 306
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,XmppProtocolManager,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Protocols\Xmpp\XmppProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Smuxi.Engine.XmppProtocolManager' Smuxi.Engine.XmppPersonModel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Smuxi.Engine,XmppPersonModel,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Config\XmppPersonModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Smuxi.Engine.XmppPersonModel' Smuxi.Engine.XmppProtocolManager
Broken Hierarchy,Smuxi.Engine,XmppGroupChatModel,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Protocols\Xmpp\XmppGroupChatModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Smuxi.Engine.GroupChatModel
Broken Hierarchy,Smuxi.Engine,XmppPersonModel,C:\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Engine-XMPP\Config\XmppPersonModel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Smuxi.Engine.PersonModel
