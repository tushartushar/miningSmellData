Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Smuxi.Frontend,NickCompleterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\NickCompleterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Smuxi.Frontend,NickCompleterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\NickCompleterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NickCompleterTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\NickCompleterTests.cs' [5' 24])' MockProtocolManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\Mocks\MockProtocolManager.cs' [4' 23])
Feature Envy,Smuxi.Frontend,NickCompleterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\NickCompleterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertNoMessagesOutput which is more interested in members of the type: MockChatView
Duplicate Abstraction,Smuxi.Frontend,MockChatView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\Mocks\MockChatView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MockChatView (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\Mocks\MockChatView.cs' [1' 22])' MockProtocolManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\Mocks\MockProtocolManager.cs' [1' 22])
Insufficient Modularization,Smuxi.Frontend,NickCompleterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\NickCompleterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Smuxi.Frontend,MockChatView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\Mocks\MockChatView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ScrollUp' ScrollDown' ScrollToStart' ScrollToEnd' Enable' Disable' Sync' Populate
Rebellious Hierarchy,Smuxi.Frontend,MockProtocolManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\meebey_smuxi\src\Frontend-Tests\Mocks\MockProtocolManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect' Disconnect' Reconnect' OpenChat' CloseChat' SetPresenceStatus
