Duplicate Abstraction,SetupTv.Sections,CMSetup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaPortal_MediaPortal-1\TvEngine3\TVLibrary\Plugins\ConflictsManager\CMSetup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CMSetup (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaPortal_MediaPortal-1\TvEngine3\TVLibrary\Plugins\ConflictsManager\CMSetup.cs' [1' 22])' ConflictsManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaPortal_MediaPortal-1\TvEngine3\TVLibrary\Plugins\ConflictsManager\ConflictsManager.cs' [1' 22])
Unutilized Abstraction,TvEngine,ConflictsManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MediaPortal_MediaPortal-1\TvEngine3\TVLibrary\Plugins\ConflictsManager\ConflictsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
