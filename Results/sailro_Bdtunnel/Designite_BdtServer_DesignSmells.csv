Duplicate Abstraction,Bdt.Server.Runtime,BdtServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Runtime\BdtServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BdtServer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Runtime\BdtServer.cs' [1' 22])' TimeoutObject (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TimeoutObject.cs' [1' 22])' TunnelSession (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TunnelSession.cs' [1' 22])' Tunnel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\Tunnel.cs' [1' 22])' TunnelConnection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TunnelConnection.cs' [1' 22])
Duplicate Abstraction,Bdt.Server.Service,TimeoutObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TimeoutObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TimeoutObject (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TimeoutObject.cs' [1' 24])' TunnelSession (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TunnelSession.cs' [1' 24])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Bdt.Server.Service,TunnelSession,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sailro_Bdtunnel\BdtServer\Service\TunnelSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Bdt.Server.Service.TunnelSession' Bdt.Server.Service.Tunnel
