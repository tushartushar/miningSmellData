Unnecessary Abstraction,BugNET.DAL,DataProviderCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.DAL\DataProviderCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,BugNET.DAL,DataProviderConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.DAL\DataProviderConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Providers' DefaultProvider
Unutilized Abstraction,BugNET.DAL,DataProviderManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.DAL\DataProviderManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,BugNET.DAL,DataProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.DAL\DataProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 187 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BugNET.DAL,DataProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.DAL\DataProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 187 methods
Insufficient Modularization,BugNET.DAL,DataProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.DAL\DataProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 187
