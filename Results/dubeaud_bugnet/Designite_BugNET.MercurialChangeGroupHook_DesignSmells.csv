Unnecessary Abstraction,BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook,AppSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook\AppSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BugNetUsername' BugNetPassword' IssueIdRegEx' BugNetServicesUrl' BugNetWindowsAuthentication
Unnecessary Abstraction,BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' BugNET_MercurialChangeGroupHook_WebServices_BugNetServices' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook,AppSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook\AppSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BugNetUsername' BugNetPassword' IssueIdRegEx' BugNetServicesUrl' BugNetWindowsAuthentication
Insufficient Modularization,BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.WebServices,BugNetServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook\Web References\WebServices\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 53 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.WebServices,BugNetServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook\Web References\WebServices\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 71 methods
Insufficient Modularization,BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.WebServices,BugNetServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dubeaud_bugnet\src\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook\Web References\WebServices\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
