Scattered Functionality,BugNET.BLL,BugNET.BLL,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: BugNET.DAL' BugNET.Common,BugNET.DAL.DataProvider' BugNET.Common.ResourceStrings
Scattered Functionality,BugNET.BLL,BugNET.BLL,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: BugNET.DAL' BugNET.BLL.Notifications,BugNET.DAL.DataProvider' BugNET.BLL.Notifications.CultureNotificationContent' BugNET.BLL.Notifications.CultureContent' BugNET.BLL.Notifications.IMailDeliveryService
