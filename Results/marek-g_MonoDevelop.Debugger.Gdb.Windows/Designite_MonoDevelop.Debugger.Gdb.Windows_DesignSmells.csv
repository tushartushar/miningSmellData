Deficient Encapsulation,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbEvent,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Reason
Deficient Encapsulation,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbCommandResult,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbCommandResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Status' ErrorMessage
Insufficient Modularization,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbSession,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbSession,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbSession,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GdbSession' GdbBacktrace
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbSession,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GdbSession' GdbDissassemblyBuffer' GdbBacktrace
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb,GdbDissassemblyBuffer,C:\repos\marek-g_MonoDevelop.Debugger.Gdb.Windows\GdbBacktrace.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
