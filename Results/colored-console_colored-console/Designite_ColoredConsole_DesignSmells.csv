Unutilized Abstraction,ColoredConsole,ColorConsole,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\colored-console_colored-console\src\ColoredConsole\ColorConsole.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ColoredConsole,ColorConsole,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\colored-console_colored-console\src\ColoredConsole\ColorConsole.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Write which is more interested in members of the type: IConsole
Unutilized Abstraction,ColoredConsole,ColorTokenExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\colored-console_colored-console\src\ColoredConsole\ColorTokenExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ColoredConsole,ValidatedNotNullAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\colored-console_colored-console\src\ColoredConsole\Guard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ColoredConsole,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\colored-console_colored-console\src\ColoredConsole\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
