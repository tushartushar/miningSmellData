Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,MIME,MimeDSN,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeDSN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadBody
Unutilized Abstraction,MIME,MimeDSN,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeDSN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MIME,MimeCodeManager,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeCodeManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MimeCodeManager' MimeFieldCodeBase
Insufficient Modularization,MIME,MimeHeader,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MIME,MimeHeader,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Cyclic Hierarchy,MIME,MimeBody,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeBody.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MimeMessage
Broken Hierarchy,MIME,MimeBody,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeBody.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MimeHeader
Broken Hierarchy,MIME,MimeDSNRecipient,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeDSNRecipient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MimeHeader
Broken Hierarchy,MIME,MimeMessage,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\MIME.NET\MimeMessage.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MimeBody
