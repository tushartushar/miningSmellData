Duplicate Abstraction,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,IEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IEmitter[5' 30]' ICalUtil[4' 29]' Parser[6' 31]' ParserError[2' 27]' Triple[2' 27]' TripleEmitter[4' 29]

Duplicate Abstraction,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,IEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IEmitter[458' 483]' TripleEmitter[83' 108]
Multifaceted Abstraction,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,RQLEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Unutilized Abstraction,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,ICalUtil,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\ICalUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Duplicate Abstraction,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,ParserError,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\ParserError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ParserError[1' 20]' Triple[1' 20]
Insufficient Modularization,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,RQLEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,RQLEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,RQLEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\Emitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: doIntro
Rebellious Hierarchy,Semaview.Shared.ICalParser,TripleEmitter,C:\repos\dblock_sncore\ICalParser.Net\TripleEmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: doIntro' doOutro' emit
