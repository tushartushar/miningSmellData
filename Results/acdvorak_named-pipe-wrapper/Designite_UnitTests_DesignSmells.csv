Unutilized Abstraction,UnitTests,SerializableTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acdvorak_named-pipe-wrapper\UnitTests\SerializableTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,UnitTests,SerializableTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acdvorak_named-pipe-wrapper\UnitTests\SerializableTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SerializableTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acdvorak_named-pipe-wrapper\UnitTests\SerializableTests.cs' [175' 194])' DataTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\acdvorak_named-pipe-wrapper\UnitTests\DataTests.cs' [348' 367])
