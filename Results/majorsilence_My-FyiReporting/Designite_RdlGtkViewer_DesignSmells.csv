Feature Envy,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,ReportArea,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\ReportArea.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetSelectedItemRectangle which is more interested in members of the type: PageItem

Unexploited Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,RenderCairo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\RenderCairo.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageTextHtml' PageLine' PageImage (in method "ProcessPage" of class "RenderCairo").
Unexploited Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,RenderCairo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\RenderCairo.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageText' PageRectangle (in method "ProcessPage" of class "RenderCairo").
Unexploited Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,ReportArea,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\ReportArea.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageText' PageTextHtml (in method "OnButtonPressEvent" of class "ReportArea").
Unexploited Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,ReportArea,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\ReportArea.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy.

Deficient Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,ReportViewer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\ReportViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DataSourceReferencePassword
Insufficient Modularization,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,CairoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\Extensions\CairoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,fyiReporting.RdlGtkViewer,CairoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlGtkViewer\RdlGtkViewer\Extensions\CairoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
