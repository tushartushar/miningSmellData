Unexploited Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlAsp,RdlSilverViewer,C:\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlAsp\RdlSilverViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageTextHtml' PageLine' PageImage' PageEllipse' PagePolygon (in method "ProcessPage" of class "RdlSilverViewer").
Unexploited Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlAsp,RdlSilverViewer,C:\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlAsp\RdlSilverViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageText' PageRectangle' PageCurve (in method "ProcessPage" of class "RdlSilverViewer").
Deficient Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlAsp,RdlListReports,C:\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlAsp\RdlListReports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Frame' RunPage' SilverlightViewer
Deficient Encapsulation,fyiReporting.RdlAsp,RdlSession,C:\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlAsp\RdlSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Count
Insufficient Modularization,fyiReporting.RdlAsp,RdlSilverViewer,C:\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlAsp\RdlSilverViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,fyiReporting.RdlAsp,RdlSilverViewer,C:\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlAsp\RdlSilverViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
