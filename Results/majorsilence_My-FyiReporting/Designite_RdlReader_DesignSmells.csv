Duplicate Abstraction,fyiReporting.RdlReader,DialogAbout,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\DialogAbout.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DialogAbout (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\DialogAbout.cs' [2' 24])' MDIChild (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\MDIChild.cs' [1' 23])' RdlReader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\RdlReader.cs' [1' 23])' ZoomTo (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\ZoomTo.cs' [1' 23])

Insufficient Modularization,fyiReporting.RdlReader,RdlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\RdlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,fyiReporting.RdlReader,RdlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlViewer\RdlReader\RdlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 140
