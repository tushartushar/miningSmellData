Duplicate Abstraction,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,PageDrawing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PageDrawing (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs' [388' 408])' PageDrawing (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs' [469' 489])

Unutilized Abstraction,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,ReportViewer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\ReportViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,ReportViewer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\ReportViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveAs which is more interested in members of the type: Report
Unexploited Encapsulation,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,PageDrawing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageTextHtml' PageLine' PageCurve' PageImage' PageEllipse' PagePolygon (in method "ProcessPage" of class "PageDrawing").
Unexploited Encapsulation,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,PageDrawing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageText' PageRectangle' PagePolygon (in method "ProcessPage" of class "PageDrawing").
Unexploited Encapsulation,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,PageDrawing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PagePie' PageCurve (in method "ProcessPage" of class "PageDrawing").
Unexploited Encapsulation,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,RenderXwt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\RenderXwt.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageTextHtml' PageLine' PageImage (in method "ProcessPage" of class "RenderXwt").
Unexploited Encapsulation,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,RenderXwt,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\RenderXwt.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: PageText' PageRectangle (in method "ProcessPage" of class "RenderXwt").
Deficient Encapsulation,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,ReportViewer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\ReportViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DataSourceReferencePassword
Insufficient Modularization,LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer,PageDrawing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\LibRdlCrossPlatformViewer\PageDrawing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
