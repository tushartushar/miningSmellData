Feature Envy,DataTests,Form1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlTests\DataTests\DataTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: bPageDown_Click which is more interested in members of the type: RdlViewer
Deficient Encapsulation,DataTests,Contact,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\majorsilence_My-FyiReporting\RdlTests\DataTests\DataTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
