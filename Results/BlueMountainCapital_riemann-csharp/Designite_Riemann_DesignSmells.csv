Duplicate Abstraction,Riemann,Event,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Riemann.Event' Riemann.Proto.Event
Duplicate Abstraction,Riemann,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Riemann.State' Riemann.Proto.State
Duplicate Abstraction,Riemann.Proto,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Riemann.pb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
