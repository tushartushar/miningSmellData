Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Riemann,Event,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Riemann.Event' Riemann.Proto.Event
Duplicate Abstraction,Riemann,State,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Riemann.State' Riemann.Proto.State
Unutilized Abstraction,Riemann.Proto,State,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Riemann.pb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Riemann.Proto,State,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Riemann.pb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  State (C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Riemann.pb.cs' [17' 57])' State (C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Riemann.pb.cs' [98' 138])
Unutilized Abstraction,Riemann.Proto,Attribute,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Riemann.pb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Riemann,Client,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectionState
Deficient Encapsulation,Riemann,TickDisposable,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NextTick' RemoveRequested
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Riemann,Client,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Riemann.Client' Riemann.RiemannTags
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Riemann,RiemannTags,C:\repos\BlueMountainCapital_riemann-csharp\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Riemann.RiemannTags' Riemann.Client
