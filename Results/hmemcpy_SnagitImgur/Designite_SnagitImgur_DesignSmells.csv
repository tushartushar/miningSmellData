Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,SnagitImgur.Plugin.ImageService,TokenInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\ImageService\IImageService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SnagitImgur.Plugin.ImageService,ImgurService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\ImageService\ImgurService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateAuthenticator which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
Unnecessary Abstraction,SnagitImgur.Plugin.ImageService,ImageInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\ImageService\ImgurService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Url' DeleteHash
Unutilized Abstraction,SnagitImgur.Plugin.Extensions,AsyncExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\Extensions\AsyncExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SnagitImgur.Plugin,ShareController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\ShareController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShareImage
Feature Envy,SnagitImgur.Plugin,ShareController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\ShareController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleResult which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
Unutilized Abstraction,SnagitImgur.Plugin,Package,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\Package.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SnagitImgur.Plugin,PackageOutput,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\PackageOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IconPath
Deficient Encapsulation,SnagitImgur.Plugin,PackageOutput,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hmemcpy_SnagitImgur\src\SnagitImgur\Plugin\PackageOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields.
