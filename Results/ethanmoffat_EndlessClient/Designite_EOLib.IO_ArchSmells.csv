Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,EOLib.IO,EOLib.IO.Repositories,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EOLib.IO.Map' EOLib.IO.Pub
Unstable Dependency,EOLib.IO,EOLib.IO.Services,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EOLib.IO.Pub' EOLib.IO.Map' EOLib.IO.Services.Serializers
Ambiguous Interface,EOLib.IO,EOLib.IO,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: IODependencyContainer
Feature Concentration,EOLib.IO,EOLib.IO,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [EquipLocation]' [IODependencyContainer]' [NumericConstants]' [PubFileNameConstants]' [ItemSize]' [ItemSpecial]' [ItemSubType]' [ItemType]' [NPCType]' [PubRecordProperty]' [SpellTarget]' [SpellTargetRestrict]' [SpellType]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
Feature Concentration,EOLib.IO,EOLib.IO.Services,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ClassFileLoadService' INumberEncoderService' IPubLoadService' ItemFileLoadService' NPCFileLoadService' NumberEncoderService' PubFileSaveService' SpellFileLoadService' IPubFileSaveService]' [IMapFileLoadService' MapFileLoadService]' [IMapFileSaveService' MapFileSaveService]' [IMapStringEncoderService' MapStringEncoderService]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.27
Scattered Functionality,EOLib.IO,EOLib.IO.Services.Serializers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: EOLib.IO.Map' EOLib.IO.Services
