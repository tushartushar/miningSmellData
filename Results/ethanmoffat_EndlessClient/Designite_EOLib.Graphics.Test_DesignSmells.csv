Unutilized Abstraction,EOLib.Graphics.Test,LibraryGraphicPairTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Graphics.Test\LibraryGraphicPairTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EOLib.Graphics.Test,NativeGraphicsLoaderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Graphics.Test\NativeGraphicsLoaderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EOLib.Graphics.Test,NativeGraphicsManagerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Graphics.Test\NativeGraphicsManagerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,EOLib.Graphics.Test,PEFileCollectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Graphics.Test\PEFileCollectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Constructor_FillsCollection_WithExpectedPEFiles which is more interested in members of the type: IPEFileCollection
Feature Envy,EOLib.Graphics.Test,PEFileCollectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Graphics.Test\PEFileCollectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Dispose_DisposesAllFiles which is more interested in members of the type: IPEFileCollection
Unutilized Abstraction,EOLib.Graphics.Test,RectangleExtensionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Graphics.Test\RectangleExtensionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
