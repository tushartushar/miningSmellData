Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EOLib.Config.Test,ConfigFileLoadActionsTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Config.Test\ConfigFileLoadActionsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,EOLib.Config.Test,ConfigFileLoadActionsTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Config.Test\ConfigFileLoadActionsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InvalidConfigFileThatExists_UsesConfigurationValueDefaults which is more interested in members of the type: IConfigurationRepository

Insufficient Modularization,EOLib.Config.Test,IniReaderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib.Config.Test\IniReaderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
