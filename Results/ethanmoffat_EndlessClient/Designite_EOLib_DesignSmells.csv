Rebellious Hierarchy,EOLib.Domain.Notifiers,NoOpNPCActionNotifier,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Domain\Notifiers\INPCActionNotifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StartNPCWalkAnimation' StartNPCAttackAnimation' RemoveNPCFromView' ShowNPCSpeechBubble
Multipath Hierarchy,EOLib.Net.Communication,SafeBlockingNetworkOperation<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\Communication\SafeBlockingNetworkOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ISafeNetworkOperation
Broken Hierarchy,EOLib.Net,EmptyPacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\EmptyPacket.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EOLib.Net.Packet
Rebellious Hierarchy,EOLib.Net.Handlers,DefaultAsyncPacketHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\Handlers\DefaultAsyncPacketHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: HandlePacket
Wide Hierarchy,EOLib.Net.Handlers,InGameOnlyPacketHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\Handlers\InGameOnlyPacketHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: EOLib.PacketHandlers.AdminHideHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.AdminShowHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.DoorOpenHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.EndPlayerWarpHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.ItemPickupHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.MainPlayerWalkHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.NPCActionHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.NPCEnterMapHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.NPCLeaveMapHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerAttackHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerAvatarChangeHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerDirectionHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerEnterMapHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerLeaveMapHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerRecoverHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.PlayerWalkHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.BeginPlayerWarpHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.RecoverStatListHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.RefreshMapStateHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.StatTrainingHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Chat.MuteHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Chat.PlayerChatByNameBase' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Chat.ServerMessageHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Chat.PlayerChatByIDHandler' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Chat.PrivateMessageTargetNotFound' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Commands.FindCommandHandlerBase' EOLib.PacketHandlers.Commands.PingResponseHandler
Missing Hierarchy,EOLib.Net.Handlers,FamilyActionPair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\Handlers\FamilyActionPair.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: FamilyActionPair' FamilyActionPair (in method "Equals" of class "FamilyActionPair").
Rebellious Hierarchy,EOLib.Net.Translators,CharacterDisplayPacketTranslator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\Translators\CharacterDisplayPacketTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TranslatePacket
Rebellious Hierarchy,EOLib.Net.Translators,MapStatePacketTranslator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ethanmoffat_EndlessClient\EOLib\Net\Translators\MapStatePacketTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TranslatePacket
