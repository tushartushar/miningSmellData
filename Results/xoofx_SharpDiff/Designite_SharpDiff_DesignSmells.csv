Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDiff,Diff3,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\Diff3.FrontEnd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDiff,Diff3Change,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\Diff3Change.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDiff,Diff3ChangeType,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\Diff3ChangeType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDiff,EnumerableExtensions,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\EnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDiff,LongestCommonSubstring,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\LongestCommonSubstring.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpDiff,Diff3Change,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\Diff3Change.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Base' From1' From2
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpDiff,Diff2,C:\repos\xoofx_SharpDiff\SharpDiff\Diff2.FrontEnd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Diff2' AlignedDiff
