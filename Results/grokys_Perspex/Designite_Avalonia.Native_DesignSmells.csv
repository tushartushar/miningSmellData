Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Native,AvaloniaNativeMacOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\AvaloniaNativePlatform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Native,Helpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Avalonia.Native,WindowBaseEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\WindowImplBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Paint which is more interested in members of the type: WindowBaseImpl
Feature Envy,Avalonia.Native,WindowBaseEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\WindowImplBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Resized which is more interested in members of the type: WindowBaseImpl
Feature Envy,Avalonia.Native,WindowBaseEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\WindowImplBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ScalingChanged which is more interested in members of the type: WindowBaseImpl
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia,AvaloniaNativePlatformExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\AvaloniaNativePlatformExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia,AvaloniaNativePlatformOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\AvaloniaNativePlatformExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UseDeferredRendering' UseGpu' OverlayPopups' AvaloniaNativeLibraryPath
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia,MacOSPlatformOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\AvaloniaNativePlatformExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ShowInDock
Insufficient Modularization,Avalonia.Native,WindowBaseImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\WindowImplBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,MenuActionCallback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\AvaloniaNativeMenuExporter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Native.CallbackBase
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,PredicateCallback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\AvaloniaNativeMenuExporter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Native.CallbackBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,OsxManagedPopupPositionerPopupImplHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\OsxManagedPopupPositionerPopupImplHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TranslatePoint' TranslateSize
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,TimerCallback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\PlatformThreadingInterface.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Native.CallbackBase
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,SignaledCallback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\PlatformThreadingInterface.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Native.CallbackBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,PopupImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\PopupImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreatePopup
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,SystemDialogEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\SystemDialogs.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Native.CallbackBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,WindowImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\WindowImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreatePopup
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Native,WindowBaseEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Native\WindowImplBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Native.CallbackBase
