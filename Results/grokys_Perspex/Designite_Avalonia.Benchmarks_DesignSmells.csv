Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,AvaloniaObjectInitializationBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\AvaloniaObjectInitializationBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,DirectPropertyBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\DirectPropertyBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,DirectClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\DirectPropertyBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IntValue' IntValueSimple' _intValue' IntValueProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,AvaloniaObjectBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\Properties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,AvaloniaObjectBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\Properties.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ClearAndSetIntProperty which is more interested in members of the type: Class1
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\Properties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' IntProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Data,BindingsBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Data\BindingsBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Data,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Data\BindingsBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IntValue' BoundValue' IntValueProperty' BoundValueProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Layout,Measure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Layout\Measure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Markup,Parsing,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Markup\Parsing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Styling,ApplyStyling,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Styling\ApplyStyling.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Traversal,VisualTreeTraversal,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Traversal\VisualTreeTraversal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Visuals.Media,PathMarkupParserTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Visuals\Media\PathMarkupParserTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,DirectClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\DirectPropertyBenchmark.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.AvaloniaObject
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Base,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Base\Properties.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.AvaloniaObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Benchmarks,NullRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\NullRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddDirty' HitTest' Paint' RecalculateChildren' Resized' Start' Stop
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Benchmarks.Data,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Benchmarks\Data\BindingsBenchmark.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.AvaloniaObject
