Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.LeakTests,AvaloniaObjectTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\AvaloniaObjectTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.LeakTests,ControlTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\ControlTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.LeakTests,Node,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\ControlTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Children
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.LeakTests,ExpressionObserverTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\ExpressionObserverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.LeakTests,NonIntegerIndexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\ExpressionObserverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _storage
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.LeakTests,TransitionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\TransitionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.LeakTests,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\AvaloniaObjectTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.AvaloniaObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.LeakTests,NullRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\ControlTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddDirty' HitTest' Paint' RecalculateChildren' Resized' Start' Stop
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.LeakTests,NonIntegerIndexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.LeakTests\ExpressionObserverTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.UnitTests.NotifyingBase
