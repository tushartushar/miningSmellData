Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,IInteractive,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\IInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventRegistry' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,IInteractive,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\IInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventRegistry' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Interactivity,NopTraverse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\Interactive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
Cyclic Hierarchy,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Wide Hierarchy,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Avalonia.Controls.CalendarDateChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.CalendarModeChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.NumericUpDownValueChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.RequestBringIntoViewEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.SpinEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.Primitives.TemplateAppliedEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.DragEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.GotFocusEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.KeyEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.PointerEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.PointerCaptureLostEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.ScrollGestureEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.ScrollGestureEndedEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.TextInputEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.VectorEventArgs
