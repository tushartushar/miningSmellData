Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.Interactivity,EventSubscription,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\EventSubscription.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Handler' Routes' AlsoIfHandled
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Interactivity,InteractiveExtensions,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\InteractiveExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,IInteractive,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\IInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,IInteractive,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\IInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,IInteractive,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\IInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,IInteractive,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\IInteractive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventArgs,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventArgs,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEventArgs' Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent' Avalonia.Interactivity.IInteractive
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEvent<TEventArgs>,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEvent.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.Interactivity.RoutedEvent
Wide Hierarchy,Avalonia.Interactivity,RoutedEventArgs,C:\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Interactivity\RoutedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Avalonia.Controls.CalendarDateChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.CalendarModeChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.RequestBringIntoViewEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.Primitives.TemplateAppliedEventArgs' Avalonia.Controls.Html.HtmlRendererRoutedEventArgs<T>' Avalonia.Input.GotFocusEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.KeyEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.PointerEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.TextInputEventArgs' Avalonia.Input.VectorEventArgs
