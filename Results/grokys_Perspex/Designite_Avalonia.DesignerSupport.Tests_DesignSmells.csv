Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,DesignerSupportTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\DesignerSupportTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Designer_In_Win32_Mode_Should_Provide_Valid_Hwnd
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,DesignerSupportTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\DesignerSupportTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,RemoteProtocolTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\RemoteProtocolTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,ExtendedMeasureViewportMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\RemoteProtocolTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Width' SomeNewProperty' SomeArrayProperty' SubObjectProperty' Height
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,SubObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\RemoteProtocolTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Foo
Broken Modularization,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,ExtendedMeasureViewportMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\RemoteProtocolTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Width' SomeNewProperty' SomeArrayProperty' SubObjectProperty' Height
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests,DisabledSyncContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.DesignerSupport.Tests\RemoteProtocolTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Post' Send
