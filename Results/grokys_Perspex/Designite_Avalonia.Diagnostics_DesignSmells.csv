Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia,DevToolsExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\DevTools.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Diagnostics,VisualTreeDebug,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\VisualTreeDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels,IDevToolViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\ViewModels\IDevToolViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Feature Envy,Avalonia.Diagnostics.Views,EventsView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\Views\EventsView.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RecordedEvents_CollectionChanged which is more interested in members of the type: ListBox
Unutilized Abstraction,Avalonia.Diagnostics.Views,PropertyChangedExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\Views\PropertyChangedExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels,EventOwnerTreeNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\ViewModels\EventOwnerTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventOwnerTreeNode' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventsViewModel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels,EventTreeNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\ViewModels\EventTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventTreeNode' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventOwnerTreeNode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels,EventOwnerTreeNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\ViewModels\EventOwnerTreeNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventOwnerTreeNode' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventsViewModel' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventTreeNode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Avalonia.Diagnostics,DevTools,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\DevTools.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Avalonia.Diagnostics.DevTools' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventTreeNode' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventOwnerTreeNode' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.EventsViewModel' Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels.DevToolsViewModel
Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Diagnostics.ViewModels,BoolToBrushConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\src\Avalonia.Diagnostics\ViewModels\EventsViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ConvertBack
