Rebellious Hierarchy,Avalonia.Layout.UnitTests,FormattedTextMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Layout.UnitTests\FullLayoutTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetLines' HitTestPoint' HitTestTextPosition' HitTestTextRange
Multipath Hierarchy,Avalonia.Layout.UnitTests,LayoutTestRoot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Layout.UnitTests\LayoutTestRoot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ILayoutable
Broken Hierarchy,Avalonia.Layout.UnitTests,ShapeLayoutTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\grokys_Perspex\tests\Avalonia.Layout.UnitTests\ShapeLayoutTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Avalonia.UnitTests.TestWithServicesBase
