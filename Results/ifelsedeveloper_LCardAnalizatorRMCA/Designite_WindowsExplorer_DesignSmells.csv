Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,WindowsExplorer,ExplorerTree,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Unutilized Abstraction,WindowsExplorer,ExplorerTree,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,WindowsExplorer,ExplorerTree,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ExplorerTree[803' 826]' ExplorerTree[1063' 1086]
Unnecessary Abstraction,WindowsExplorer,SHQUERYRBINFO,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' cbSize' i64Size' i64NumItems
Multifaceted Abstraction,WindowsExplorer,frmOptions,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\frmOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Deficient Encapsulation,WindowsExplorer,SHQUERYRBINFO,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cbSize' i64Size' i64NumItems
Deficient Encapsulation,WindowsExplorer,frmOptions,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\frmOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: myDocument' myFavorite' myNetwork' myAddressbar' myToolbar
Insufficient Modularization,WindowsExplorer,ExplorerTree,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,WindowsExplorer,ExplorerTree,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\Explorer Tree\ExplorerTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 162
