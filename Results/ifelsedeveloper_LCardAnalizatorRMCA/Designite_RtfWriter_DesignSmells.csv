Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,DW.RtfWriter,WMETA8,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\WMETA8.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: WMETA8[212' 256]' WMETA8[281' 325]
Unnecessary Abstraction,DW.RtfWriter,DefaultValue,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfBasics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' FontSize' Font' MarginLarge' MarginSmall
Imperative Abstraction,DW.RtfWriter,RtfImage,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: imageToByteArray
Deficient Encapsulation,DW.RtfWriter,DefaultValue,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfBasics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FontSize' Font' MarginLarge' MarginSmall
Deficient Encapsulation,DW.RtfWriter,DefaultValue,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfBasics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: FontSize' Font' MarginLarge' MarginSmall
Broken Modularization,DW.RtfWriter,RtfBlock,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfAbstract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Alignment' Margins' DefaultCharFormat' StartNewPage' BlockHead' BlockTail
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DW.RtfWriter,CellMergeInfo,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfBasics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CellMergeInfo' RtfTableCell
Insufficient Modularization,DW.RtfWriter,RtfTable,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 121
Broken Hierarchy,DW.RtfWriter,RtfDocument,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfDocument.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RtfBlockList
Broken Hierarchy,DW.RtfWriter,RtfFootnote,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfFootnote.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RtfBlockList
Broken Hierarchy,DW.RtfWriter,RtfHeaderFooter,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfHeaderFooter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RtfBlockList
Unfactored Hierarchy,DW.RtfWriter,RtfImage,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfImage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: RtfImage[87' 107]' RtfTable[56' 76]
Broken Hierarchy,DW.RtfWriter,RtfTableCell,C:\repos\ifelsedeveloper_LCardAnalizatorRMCA\RtfWriter\RtfTableCell.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RtfBlockList
