Imperative Abstraction,CreateShortcut,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rscustom_rocksmith-custom-song-toolkit\CreateToolkitShortcut\CreateToolkitShortcut\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unutilized Abstraction,CreateShortcut,IShellLinkW,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rscustom_rocksmith-custom-song-toolkit\CreateToolkitShortcut\CreateToolkitShortcut\ShellLinkNative.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CreateShortcut,ShellLink,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rscustom_rocksmith-custom-song-toolkit\CreateToolkitShortcut\CreateToolkitShortcut\ShellLinkNative.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
