Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Downtify.GUI,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\GUI\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TransferConfig which is more interested in members of the type: XmlConfiguration
Unutilized Abstraction,Downtify.GUI,PlaceholderTextBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\GUI\PlaceholderTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Downtify.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Downtify.GUI,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\GUI\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: configuration' lang
Deficient Encapsulation,Downtify.GUI,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\GUI\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: configuration' lang
Insufficient Modularization,Downtify,SpotifyDownloader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\SpotifyDownloader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Downtify,SpotifyDownloader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\SpotifyDownloader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Downtify.GUI,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\GUI\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Downtify.GUI.frmMain' Downtify.SpotifyDownloader
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Downtify.GUI,frmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Shawak_downtify\Downtify\GUI\frmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Downtify.GUI.frmMain' Downtify.SpotifyDownloader' Downtify.TrackItem
