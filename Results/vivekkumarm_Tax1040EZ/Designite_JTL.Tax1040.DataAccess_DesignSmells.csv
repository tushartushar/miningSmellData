Unnecessary Abstraction,JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess.DataService,EFileDataService,C:\repos\vivekkumarm_Tax1040EZ\Feature\Code\JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess\DataService\EFileDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess.DataService,EFileDataService,C:\repos\vivekkumarm_Tax1040EZ\Feature\Code\JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess\DataService\EFileDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess,PaymentDataService,C:\repos\vivekkumarm_Tax1040EZ\Feature\Code\JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess\DataService\PaymentDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PaymentDataService[62' 99]' PaymentDataService[172' 209]
Duplicate Abstraction,JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess,PersonalInfoDataService,C:\repos\vivekkumarm_Tax1040EZ\Feature\Code\JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess\DataService\PersonalInfoDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PersonalInfoDataService[701' 732]' PersonalInfoDataService[797' 828]
Duplicate Abstraction,JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess,UserDataService,C:\repos\vivekkumarm_Tax1040EZ\Feature\Code\JTL.Tax1040.DataAccess\DataService\UserDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
