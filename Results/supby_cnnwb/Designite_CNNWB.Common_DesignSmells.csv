Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,HSL,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\ColorSpaceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HSL[39' 77]' HSL[708' 746]
Duplicate Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,HSL,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\ColorSpaceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HSL[1315' 1340]' HSL[1373' 1398]
Unutilized Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,ColorSpaceHelper,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\ColorSpaceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,Deque,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Deque.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: CNNWB.Common.Deque' LSCollections.Deque
Duplicate Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,Deque,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Deque.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Deque[13' 852]' Deque[13' 852]
Unnecessary Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,Weight,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Value' DiagonalHessian' D1Err
Unnecessary Abstraction,CNNWB.Common,Neuron,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Output' D1ErrX
Deficient Encapsulation,CNNWB.Common,Mappings,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Mapping
Deficient Encapsulation,CNNWB.Common,Connection,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ToNeuronIndex' ToWeightIndex
Deficient Encapsulation,CNNWB.Common,Weight,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value' DiagonalHessian' D1Err
Deficient Encapsulation,CNNWB.Common,Neuron,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\Enums.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Output' D1ErrX
Insufficient Modularization,CNNWB.Common,ColorSpaceHelper,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\ColorSpaceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 66 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,CNNWB.Common,ColorSpaceHelper,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\ColorSpaceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 69 methods
Insufficient Modularization,CNNWB.Common,ColorSpaceHelper,C:\repos\supby_cnnwb\CNNWB.Common\ColorSpaceHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 158
