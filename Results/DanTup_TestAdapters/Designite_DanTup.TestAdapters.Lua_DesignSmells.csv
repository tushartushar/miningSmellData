Unutilized Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Lua,LuaTestContainerDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Lua\LuaTestContainerDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Lua,LuaTestDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Lua\LuaTestDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ExtensionFolder' ExternalTestExecutor' ExecutorUri' extensionFolder' executor
