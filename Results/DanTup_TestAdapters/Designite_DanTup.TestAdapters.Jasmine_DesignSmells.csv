Unnecessary Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasminTestContentTypeDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasminTestContentTypeDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IJasminTestContentType' JasminTestFileExtension' JasminTestFileExtension2' JasminTestContentType
Unutilized Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasminTestContentTypeDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasminTestContentTypeDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestContainerDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestContainerDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ExtensionFolder' ExternalTestExecutor' ExecutorUri' extensionFolder' executor
Unutilized Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestExecutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ExternalTestExecutor' ExecutorUri' TestExecutorUriString' TestExecutorUri' executor
Deficient Encapsulation,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestExecutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestExecutorUri
Deficient Encapsulation,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestExecutor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TestExecutorUri
Broken Modularization,DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine,JasmineTestDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanTup_TestAdapters\DanTup.TestAdapters.Jasmine\JasmineTestDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ExtensionFolder' ExternalTestExecutor' ExecutorUri' extensionFolder' executor
