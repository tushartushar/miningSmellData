Duplicate Abstraction,GameRes.Formats.Microsoft,CabEntry,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\Cabinet\ArcCAB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CabEntry (C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\Cabinet\ArcCAB.cs' [4' 26])' IgsDatOpener (C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\CellWorks\ArcDB.cs' [4' 26])' WebPMetaData (C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\WebP\ImageWEBP.cs' [4' 26])' OpusAudio (C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\Opus\AudioOPUS.cs' [4' 26])

Deficient Encapsulation,GameRes.Formats.Google,WebPMetaData,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\WebP\ImageWEBP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Flags' IsLossless' HasAlpha' DataOffset' DataSize' AlphaOffset' AlphaSize
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameRes.Formats.CellWorks,IgsDatOpener,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\CellWorks\ArcDB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameRes.Formats.CellWorks.IgsDatOpener' GameRes.Formats.CellWorks.IgsDbReader
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GameRes.Formats.CellWorks,IgsDbReader,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\CellWorks\ArcDB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GameRes.Formats.CellWorks.IgsDbReader' GameRes.Formats.CellWorks.IgsDatOpener
Broken Modularization,GameRes.Formats.Google,WebPMetaData,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\WebP\ImageWEBP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Flags' IsLossless' HasAlpha' DataOffset' DataSize' AlphaOffset' AlphaSize
Broken Hierarchy,GameRes.Formats.Microsoft,CabEntry,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\Cabinet\ArcCAB.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GameRes.Entry
Rebellious Hierarchy,GameRes.Formats.Google,WebPFormat,C:\repos\morkt_GARbro\Experimental\WebP\ImageWEBP.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write
