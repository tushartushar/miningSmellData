Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,FaceMouse,FirstTimeRun,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\FirstTimeRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,FaceMouse,Main,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Multifaceted Abstraction,FaceMouse,MyPipeline,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.85
Multifaceted Abstraction,gma.System.Windows,UserActivityHook,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\UserActivityHook.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Duplicate Abstraction,gma.System.Windows,UserActivityHook,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\UserActivityHook.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: UserActivityHook[235' 256]' UserActivityHook[627' 648]' UserActivityHook[707' 728]
Unnecessary Abstraction,FaceMouse.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,FaceMouse,Main,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: pipeline' player' isRunning' ollYValues' actHook
Deficient Encapsulation,FaceMouse,MyPipeline,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: takeRecoSnapshot' canClick
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FaceMouse,Main,C:\repos\a-delrio_FaceMouse-en\facereco_test\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Main' MyPipeline
