Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLua,DynamicLibraryPath,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\DynamicLibraryPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLua,Lua,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLua,LuaState,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\LuaState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLua,LuaTag,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\LuaTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,KeraLua,LuaDebug,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\LuaDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: eventCode' currentline' linedefined' lastlinedefined' short_src
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,Lua,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 77 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,Lua,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 77 methods
Broken Modularization,KeraLua,LuaDebug,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\LuaDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: name' namewhat' source' shortsrc' eventCode' pname' pnamewhat' pwhat' psource' currentline' linedefined' lastlinedefined' nups' nparams' isvararg' istailcall' short_src' i_ci
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,NativeMethods,C:\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\KeraLua\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 77 methods
