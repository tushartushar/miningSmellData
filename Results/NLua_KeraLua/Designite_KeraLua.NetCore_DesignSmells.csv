Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLua,DelegateExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\DelegateExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,KeraLua,LuaRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\LuaRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name' function
Deficient Encapsulation,KeraLua,LuaDebug,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\LuaDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Event' CurrentLine' LineDefined' LastLineDefined' NumberUpValues' NumberParameters' IsVarArg' IsTailCall
Deficient Encapsulation,KeraLua,LuaRegister,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\LuaRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name' function
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,Lua,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 174 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,Lua,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 178 methods
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,Lua,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\Lua.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 211
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,NativeMethods,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 121 methods
Insufficient Modularization,KeraLua,NativeMethods,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\src\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 121
