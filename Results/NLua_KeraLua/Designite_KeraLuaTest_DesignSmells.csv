Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLua.Tests,Core,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,KeraLua.Tests,Core,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertFile which is more interested in members of the type: Lua
Unutilized Abstraction,KeraLuaTest.Tests,Interop,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Interop.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,KeraLuaTest.Tests,Interop,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Interop.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Interop (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Interop.cs' [211' 237])' Interop (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Interop.cs' [256' 282])
Deficient Encapsulation,KeraLua.Tests,Core,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: func_print
Deficient Encapsulation,KeraLua.Tests,Core,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: func_print
Deficient Encapsulation,KeraLuaTest.Tests,Interop,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLua_KeraLua\tests\Tests\Interop.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
