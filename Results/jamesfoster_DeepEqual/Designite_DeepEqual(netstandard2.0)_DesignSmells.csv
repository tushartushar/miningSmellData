Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual,ComparisonContextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\ComparisonContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual,ComparisonResultExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\ComparisonResultExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,DeepEqual,ComplexObjectComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\ComplexObjectComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CompareObjects
Feature Envy,DeepEqual,ComplexObjectComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\ComplexObjectComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SourceAndDestinationPresent which is more interested in members of the type: PropertyPair
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeepEqual,PropertyReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\PropertyReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Read' DeclaringType
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual.Syntax,ObjectExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Syntax\ObjectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Wide Hierarchy,DeepEqual,IComparison,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\IComparison.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: DeepEqual.ComplexObjectComparison' DeepEqual.CompositeComparison' DeepEqual.DefaultComparison' DeepEqual.DictionaryComparison' DeepEqual.EnumComparison' DeepEqual.FloatComparison' DeepEqual.ListComparison' DeepEqual.SetComparison' DeepEqual.Benchmark.CustomComparison' DeepEqual.Test.RegexComparison' DeepEqual.Test.Helper.EchoComparison' DeepEqual.Test.Helper.MockComparison
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeepEqual.Formatting,DifferenceFormatterBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Formatting\DifferenceFormatterBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Format
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeepEqual.Syntax,CompareSyntax<TActual;TExpected>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Syntax\CompareSyntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create' GetFormatterFactory
