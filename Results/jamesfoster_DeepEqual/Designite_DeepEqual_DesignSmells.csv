Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DeepEqual,ComplexObjectComparer,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\ComplexObjectComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CompareObjects
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual,ComparisonResultExtensions,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Extensions\ComparisonResultExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual,ComparisonContextExtensions,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Extensions\ComparisonContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeepEqual,PropertyReader,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\PropertyReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Read' DeclaringType
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual.Syntax,DeepEqualException,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Syntax\DeepEqualException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepEqual.Syntax,ObjectExtensions,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Syntax\ObjectExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,DeepEqual.Formatting,DifferenceFormatterFactory,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Formatting\DifferenceFormatterFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MissingEntryDifference' SetDifference (in method "GetFormatter" of class "DifferenceFormatterFactory").
Broken Hierarchy,DeepEqual,MissingEntryDifference,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\MissingEntryDifference.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DeepEqual.Difference
Broken Hierarchy,DeepEqual,SetDifference,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\SetDifference.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DeepEqual.Difference
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeepEqual.Formatting,DifferenceFormatterBase,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Formatting\DifferenceFormatterBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Format
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeepEqual.Syntax,CompareSyntax<TActual;TExpected>,C:\repos\jamesfoster_DeepEqual\src\DeepEqual\Syntax\CompareSyntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create
