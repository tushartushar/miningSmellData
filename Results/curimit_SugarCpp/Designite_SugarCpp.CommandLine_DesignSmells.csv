Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SugarCpp.CommandLine,CompilerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\curimit_SugarCpp\src\SugarCpp.CommandLine\Compile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Command' AdditionalArgs' OutputArg
Imperative Abstraction,SugarCpp.CommandLine,Translate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\curimit_SugarCpp\src\SugarCpp.CommandLine\Translate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Deficient Encapsulation,SugarCpp.CommandLine,CompilerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\curimit_SugarCpp\src\SugarCpp.CommandLine\Compile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Command' AdditionalArgs' OutputArg
