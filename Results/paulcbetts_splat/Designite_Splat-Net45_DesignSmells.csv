Insufficient Modularization,Splat,IFullLogger,C:\repos\paulcbetts_splat\src\Splat\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Splat,WrappingFullLogger,C:\repos\paulcbetts_splat\src\Splat\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 62 public methods
