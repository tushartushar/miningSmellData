Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spike.Network,IEntity,C:\repos\Kelindar_spike-bench\Stress.Client\spike-sdk.csharp.src.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IEntity' PacketReader
Insufficient Modularization,Spike.Network,PacketReader,C:\repos\Kelindar_spike-bench\Stress.Client\spike-sdk.csharp.src.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Spike.Network,PacketReader,C:\repos\Kelindar_spike-bench\Stress.Client\spike-sdk.csharp.src.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Spike.Network,PacketReader,C:\repos\Kelindar_spike-bench\Stress.Client\spike-sdk.csharp.src.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PacketReader' IEntity' PacketWriter' IEntity
Insufficient Modularization,Spike.Network,PacketWriter,C:\repos\Kelindar_spike-bench\Stress.Client\spike-sdk.csharp.src.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
