Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Excel,Excel.Core.BinaryFormat,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Excel.Core.BinaryFormat' Excel
Unstable Dependency,Excel,Excel.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Excel.Log
Unstable Dependency,Excel,Excel,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Excel.Core.BinaryFormat' Excel.Core.OpenXmlFormat
Ambiguous Interface,Excel,Excel.Core.OpenXmlFormat,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: XlsxDimension
God Component,Excel,Excel.Core.BinaryFormat,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 41
Feature Concentration,Excel,Excel.Core.OpenXmlFormat,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [XlsxDimension' XlsxWorksheet' XlsxNumFmt' XlsxStyles' XlsxWorkbook' XlsxXf' XlsxSST]' [XmlReaderExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25
Scattered Functionality,Excel,Excel,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Excel.Core.BinaryFormat' Excel.Log
