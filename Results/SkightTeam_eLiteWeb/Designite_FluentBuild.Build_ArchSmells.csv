Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Ambiguous Interface,FluentBuild.Build,Build.Samples,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: MultiTargetingSample,Build.Samples.MultiTargetingSample
Feature Concentration,FluentBuild.Build,Build.Samples,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
