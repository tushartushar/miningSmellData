Multifaceted Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,Engine,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Duplicate Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,Engine,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Engine[1' 28]' InflowAtNode[1' 28]' Program[1' 28]' LinkableComponent[1' 28]
Duplicate Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,Engine,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Engine[1' 30]' LinkableComponent[1' 30]
Duplicate Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,InflowAtNode,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\ExchangeItems.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: InflowAtNode[1' 29]' Program[1' 29]
Unutilized Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,LinkableComponent,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\LinkableComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexloited Encapsulation,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,LinkableComponent,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\LinkableComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ItemInBase' InflowAtNode (in method "EngineUpdateFromTargets" of class "LinkableComponent").
Insufficient Modularization,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,Engine,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,InflowAtNode,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\ExchangeItems.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ItemInDoubleBase
Broken Hierarchy,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,GroundWaterLevelAtNode,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\ExchangeItems.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ItemInDoubleBase
Broken Hierarchy,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleCSharpRiver2,FlowAlongBranch,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleCSharpRiver2\ExchangeItems.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ItemOutDoubleBase
