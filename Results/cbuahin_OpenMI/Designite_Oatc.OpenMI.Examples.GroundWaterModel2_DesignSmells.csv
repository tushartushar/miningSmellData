Imperative Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleGroundModel2,GridInfo,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleGroundWaterModel2\GridInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleGroundModel2,LinkableComponent,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleGroundWaterModel2\LinkableComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexloited Encapsulation,Oatc.OpenMI.Examples.SimpleGroundModel2,LinkableComponent,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\SimpleGroundWaterModel2\LinkableComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ItemInBase' Inflow (in method "EngineUpdateFromTargets" of class "LinkableComponent").
