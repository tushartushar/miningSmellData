Duplicate Abstraction,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,Controller,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\Controller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Controller[1' 29]' IterationController[1' 29]' OptimizationController[1' 29]' ParameterDescriptor[1' 29]' SumSquaredDifference[1' 29]
Duplicate Abstraction,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,IterationController,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\IterationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IterationController[1' 30]' ParameterDescriptor[1' 30]' SumSquaredDifference[1' 30]' OptimizationController[1' 30]
Duplicate Abstraction,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,ParameterDescriptor,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\ParameterDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Deficient Encapsulation,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,Solution,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\OptimizationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _values' _minimum' _maximum' _cost' random
Deficient Encapsulation,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,Solution,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\OptimizationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: _minimum' _maximum
Broken Hierarchy,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,Controller,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\Controller.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LinkableComponent
Rebellious Hierarchy,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,IterationController,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\IterationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Prepare' Finish
Unfactored Hierarchy,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,IterationController,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\IterationController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: IterationController[1' 31]' OptimizationController[1' 31]
Rebellious Hierarchy,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,OptimizationController,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\OptimizationController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Prepare' Finish
Unfactored Hierarchy,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,OptimizationController,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\OptimizationController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: OptimizationController[91' 129]' SumSquaredDifference[77' 115]
Rebellious Hierarchy,org.OpenMI.Utilities.AdvancedControl,SumSquaredDifference,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Examples\AdvancedControl\SumSquaredDifference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
