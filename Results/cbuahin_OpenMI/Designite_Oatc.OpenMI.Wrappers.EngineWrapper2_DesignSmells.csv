Duplicate Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Wrappers.EngineWrapper2.SourceAdapters,Factory1,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Wrappers\EngineWrapper2\AdapterFactories.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Factory1[1' 29]' AddapterBase[1' 29]' Linear[1' 29]' Point2D[1' 29]' ItemBase[1' 29]' ItemInBase[1' 29]' ItemInDoubleArrayBase[1' 29]' ItemInDoubleBase[1' 29]' LinkableComponent[1' 29]' ItemOutBase[1' 29]' ItemOutDoubleArrayBase[1' 29]' ItemOutDoubleBase[1' 29]
Multifaceted Abstraction,Oatc.OpenMI.Wrappers.EngineWrapper2,LinkableComponent,C:\repos\cbuahin_OpenMI\Source\csharp\Oatc.OpenMI\Wrappers\EngineWrapper2\LinkableComponent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.96
