Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MapControl,LocationCollectionConverter,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\LocationCollectionConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MapControl,LocationConverter,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\LocationConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,MapControl,MapItemsControl,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapItemsControl.WPF.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MapControl,IMapElement,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ParentMap
Unutilized Abstraction,MapControl,Pushpin,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\Pushpin.WPF.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MapControl,TileLayerCollection,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\TileLayerCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,MapControl,TileSource,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\TileSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetUri
Unutilized Abstraction,MapControl,TileSourceConverter,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\TileSourceConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AnimationDuration' AnimationEasingFunction
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AnimationDuration' AnimationEasingFunction
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,Tile,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\Tile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AnimationDuration
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,Tile,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\Tile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AnimationDuration
Insufficient Modularization,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MapControl,TileLayer,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\TileLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TileLayer' TileImageLoader
Cyclic Hierarchy,MapControl,MapPanel,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MapBase
Broken Hierarchy,MapControl,ImageTileSource,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\ImageTileSource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TileSource
