Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,MapControl,TileSource,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\TileSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetUri
Unutilized Abstraction,MapControl,TileSourceConverter,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\TileSourceConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AnimationDuration' AnimationEasingFunction
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,MapBase,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AnimationDuration' AnimationEasingFunction
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,MapGraticule,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapGraticule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LineSpacings
Deficient Encapsulation,MapControl,MapGraticule,C:\repos\mikeyoon_WPFCodingTest\MapControl\MapGraticule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LineSpacings
