Duplicate Abstraction,GadrocsWorkshop.Eos,EosBusCommands,C:\repos\Gadroc_EosSharp\EosSharp\EosBusCommands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EosBusCommands[1' 20]' EosBusStatistics[1' 20]' EosOutput[1' 20]' EosParserError[1' 20]' EosParserErrorEventArgs[1' 20]
Multifaceted Abstraction,GadrocsWorkshop.Eos,EosBusInterfaceSerial,C:\repos\Gadroc_EosSharp\EosSharp\EosBusInterfaceSerial.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83

Unnecessary Abstraction,GadrocsWorkshop.Eos,EosBusStatistics,C:\repos\Gadroc_EosSharp\EosSharp\EosBusStatistics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PacketErrors' Overruns' Collisions' Timeouts
Unutilized Abstraction,GadrocsWorkshop.Eos,EosCommandProcessor,C:\repos\Gadroc_EosSharp\EosSharp\EosCommandProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
