Unutilized Abstraction,HtmlElements.Tests,AnnotatedHtmlElementPageTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\AnnotatedHtmlElementPageTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HtmlElements.Tests,FormFillingTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\FormFillingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,HtmlElements.Tests,FormFillingTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\FormFillingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: FormFieldsShouldBeFilledCorrectly which is more interested in members of the type: MockedForm
Unutilized Abstraction,HtmlElements.Tests,HtmlElementInitializationTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\HtmlElementInitializationTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HtmlElements.Tests,UsingSelectTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\UsingSelectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,HtmlElements.Tests,RegisterForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\UsingSelectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: country

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequestInput' SearchButton' SuggestList' requestInput' searchButton' suggestList
Broken Modularization,HtmlElements.Tests.TestElements,SearchArrowData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\TestElements\SearchArrowData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SearchArrowName' SearchArrowClass' RequestInputName' RequestInputClass' SearchButtonClass' SuggestClass' SearchRequestSampleClass
Broken Hierarchy,HtmlElements.Tests,RegisterForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\UsingSelectTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Yandex.HtmlElements.Elements.HtmlElement
Broken Hierarchy,HtmlElements.Tests.TestElements,MockedForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\TestElements\MockedForm.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Yandex.HtmlElements.Elements.Form
Broken Hierarchy,HtmlElements.Tests.TestElements,SearchArrow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yandex-qatools_htmlelements-dotnet\HtmlElements-DotNet\HtmlElements-Tests\Tests\TestElements\SearchArrow.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Yandex.HtmlElements.Elements.HtmlElement
