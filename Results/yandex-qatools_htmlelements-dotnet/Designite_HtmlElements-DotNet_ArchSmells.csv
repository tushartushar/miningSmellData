Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,HtmlElements-DotNet,Yandex.HtmlElements.Loaders.Decorators,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Yandex.HtmlElements.Loaders.Decorators' Yandex.HtmlElements.Loaders.Decorators.ProxyHandlers
Unstable Dependency,HtmlElements-DotNet,Yandex.HtmlElements.Elements,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Yandex.HtmlElements.Utils
Unstable Dependency,HtmlElements-DotNet,Yandex.HtmlElements.Loaders.Decorators,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Yandex.HtmlElements.Loaders.Decorators.ProxyHandlers
