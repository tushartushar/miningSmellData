Unnecessary Abstraction,NHapiTools.Model.V281,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,NHapiTools.Model.V281,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Group,GroupExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Message,MessageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Message\MessageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Segment,SegmentExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Segment\SegmentExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Group,GroupExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 4881 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Group,GroupExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 4881 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Group,GroupExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 8135
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Message,MessageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Message\MessageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 2118 public methods

Total methods in the class: 2118 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Message,MessageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Message\MessageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 3530
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V281.Segment,SegmentExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V281\Segment\SegmentExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 1611 public methods
