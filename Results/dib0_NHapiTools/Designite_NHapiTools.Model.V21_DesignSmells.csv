Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V21.Group,GroupExtensions,C:\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V21\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 66 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V21.Group,GroupExtensions,C:\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V21\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 66 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NHapiTools.Model.V21.Group,GroupExtensions,C:\repos\dib0_NHapiTools\Model.V21\Group\GroupExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 132
