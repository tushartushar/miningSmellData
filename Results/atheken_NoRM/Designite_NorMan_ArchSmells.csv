Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.48  All the dependencies among components: from: Norm' to: Norm.BSON.DbTypes' from: Norm' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm' to: Norm.Collections' from: Norm' to: Norm.Commands.Modifiers' from: Norm' to: Norm.Protocol.Messages' from: Norm' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Requests' from: Norm' to: Norm.Responses' from: Norm' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages' from: Norm' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm' to: Norm.Commands' from: Norm' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Request' from: Norm' to: Norm.Commands.Qualifiers' from: Norm.BSON' to: Norm' from: Norm.BSON' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.BSON' to: Norm.BSON.DbTypes' from: Norm.BSON' to: Norm.Attributes' from: Norm.BSON.DbTypes' to: Norm' from: Norm.BSON.DbTypes' to: Norm.Collections' from: Norm.BSON.DbTypes' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.BSON.TypeConverters' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Attributes' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Commands.Modifiers' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Responses' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Protocol.Messages' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Linq' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Protocol' from: Norm.Collections' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Requests' from: Norm.Commands.Modifiers' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Commands.Modifiers' to: Norm' from: Norm.Commands.Qualifiers' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Commands' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Configuration' to: Norm.BSON.TypeConverters' from: Norm.Configuration' to: Norm' from: Norm.Configuration' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Configuration' to: Norm.BSON.DbTypes' from: Norm.GridFS' to: Norm' from: Norm.GridFS' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.GridFS' to: Norm.Attributes' from: Norm.GridFS' to: Norm.Collections' from: Norm.Linq' to: Norm' from: Norm.Linq' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Linq' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.Linq' to: Norm.Protocol.Messages' from: Norm.Linq' to: Norm.Responses' from: Norm.Linq' to: Norm.Collections' from: Norm.Protocol' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.Protocol' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages' from: Norm.Protocol' to: Norm' from: Norm.Protocol' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm.Responses' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm.Attributes' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm.Protocol' from: Norm.Protocol.Messages' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Request' to: Norm.Collections' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Request' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Request' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Requests' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Requests' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Requests' to: Norm.Protocol' from: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages.Requests' to: Norm.Protocol.SystemMessages' from: Norm.Responses' to: Norm.Configuration' from: Norm.Responses' to: Norm.BSON' from: Norm.Responses' to: Norm' from: Norm.Responses' to: Norm.Collections' from: NoRM.Tests.CollectionFindTests' to: Norm.Tests' from: Norm.Tests.CollectionUpdateTests' to: Norm.Tests' from: NoRM.Tests.DBTypeTests' to: Norm.Tests' from: NoRM.Tests' to: Norm.Tests' from: NoRM.Tests.GridFS' to: Norm.Tests.,Norm.ObjectId' Norm.MongoCollectionExtensions' Norm.MongoCollectionExtensions' Norm.MongoCollectionExtensions' Norm.MongoCollectionExtensions' Norm.ConnectionProvider' Norm.ConnectionProvider' Norm.IMongoDatabase' Norm.MapReduceOptions<T>' Norm.M' Norm.MongoDatabase' Norm.Q,
