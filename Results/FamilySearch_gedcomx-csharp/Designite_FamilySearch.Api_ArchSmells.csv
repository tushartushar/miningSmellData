Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Feature Concentration,FamilySearch.Api,FamilySearch.Api.Util,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ChangeEntry' ChangeHistoryPage]' [ExperimentsFilter]' [FamilySearchOptions' MergeAnalysisFilter]' [RequestUtil]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.41  All the dependencies among components: from: FamilySearch.Api' to: Gx.Fs.Discussions' from: FamilySearch.Api' to: Gx.Rs.Api.Util' from: FamilySearch.Api' to: Gx.Links' from:
