Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Chess,AsciiBoardBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erikdietrich_ChessTDD\Chess\AsciiBoardBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Chess,ThreatEvaluator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erikdietrich_ChessTDD\Chess\ThreatEvaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DoesSquareAttack which is more interested in members of the type: Board
Unutilized Abstraction,Chess,PiecePositioner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erikdietrich_ChessTDD\Chess\PiecePositioner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Chess,PiecePositioner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erikdietrich_ChessTDD\Chess\PiecePositioner.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetupStandardPawns which is more interested in members of the type: Board
