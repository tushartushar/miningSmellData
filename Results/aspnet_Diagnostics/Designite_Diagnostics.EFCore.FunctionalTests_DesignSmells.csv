Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.Tests,DatabaseErrorPageMiddlewareTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\DatabaseErrorPageMiddlewareTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.Tests,DatabaseErrorPageMiddlewareTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\DatabaseErrorPageMiddlewareTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DatabaseErrorPageMiddlewareTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\DatabaseErrorPageMiddlewareTest.cs' [36' 56])' MigrationsEndPointMiddlewareTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\MigrationsEndPointMiddlewareTest.cs' [32' 52])

Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.FunctionalTests.Helpers,PlatformHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\Helpers\PlatformHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsMono
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.FunctionalTests.Helpers,NullScope,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\Helpers\TestLoggerProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.FunctionalTests.Helpers,NullScope,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\Helpers\TestLoggerProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Instance
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.Tests,MigrationOne,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Diagnostics.EFCore.FunctionalTests\TestModels\BloggingContextWithMigrations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Up' Up
