Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,DefaultHealthCheckService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\DefaultHealthCheckService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CheckHealthAsync
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckServiceOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\HealthCheckServiceOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Registrations
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,HealthChecksBuilderAddCheckExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\DependencyInjection\HealthChecksBuilderAddCheckExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,HealthChecksBuilderDelegateExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\DependencyInjection\HealthChecksBuilderDelegateExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,HealthCheckServiceCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\DependencyInjection\HealthCheckServiceCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,EventIds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\DefaultHealthCheckService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HealthCheckProcessingBegin' HealthCheckProcessingEnd' HealthCheckBegin' HealthCheckEnd' HealthCheckError' HealthCheckData' HealthCheckPublisherProcessingBegin' HealthCheckPublisherProcessingEnd' HealthCheckPublisherProcessingError' HealthCheckPublisherBegin' HealthCheckPublisherEnd' HealthCheckPublisherError' HealthCheckPublisherTimeout
