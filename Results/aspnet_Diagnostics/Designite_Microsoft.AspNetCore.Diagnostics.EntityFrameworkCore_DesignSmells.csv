Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,DatabaseErrorPageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\DatabaseErrorPageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,DatabaseErrorPageOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\DatabaseErrorPageOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MigrationsEndPointPath
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,MigrationsEndPointExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\MigrationsEndPointExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,MigrationsEndPointOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\MigrationsEndPointOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path' DefaultPath
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore,MigrationsEndPointMiddleware,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\MigrationsEndPointMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Invoke
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.Internal,DiagnosticsEntityFrameworkCoreLoggerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\Internal\DiagnosticsEntityFrameworkCoreLoggerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.Internal,DiagnosticsEntityFrameworkCoreLoggerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\Internal\DiagnosticsEntityFrameworkCoreLoggerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.DiagnosticsViewPage.Views,BaseView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\shared\BaseView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,MigrationsEndPointOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\MigrationsEndPointOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultPath
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,MigrationsEndPointOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\MigrationsEndPointOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultPath
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,MigrationsEndPointOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore\MigrationsEndPointOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.MigrationsEndPointOptions' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore.MigrationsEndPointMiddleware
