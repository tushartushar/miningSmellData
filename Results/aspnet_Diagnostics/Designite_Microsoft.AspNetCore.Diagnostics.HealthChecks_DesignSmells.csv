Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs' [72' 93])' HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs' [102' 123])
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder,HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs' [142' 161])' HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\Builder\HealthCheckApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs' [175' 194])
Feature Envy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckMiddleware,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\HealthCheckMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InvokeAsync which is more interested in members of the type: HealthCheckOptions
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\HealthCheckOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Predicate' ResultStatusCodes' ResponseWriter' AllowCachingResponses
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckMiddleware,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks\HealthCheckMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthCheckMiddleware' Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthCheckOptions
