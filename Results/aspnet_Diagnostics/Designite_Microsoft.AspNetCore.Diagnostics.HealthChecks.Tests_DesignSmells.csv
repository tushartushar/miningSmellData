Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckMiddlewareSampleTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Tests\HealthCheckMiddlewareSampleTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckMiddlewareTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Tests\HealthCheckMiddlewareTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckMiddlewareTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Tests\HealthCheckMiddlewareTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HealthCheckMiddlewareTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Tests\HealthCheckMiddlewareTests.cs' [525' 546])' HealthCheckMiddlewareTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Tests\HealthCheckMiddlewareTests.cs' [587' 608])
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckMiddlewareTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\test\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Tests\HealthCheckMiddlewareTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
