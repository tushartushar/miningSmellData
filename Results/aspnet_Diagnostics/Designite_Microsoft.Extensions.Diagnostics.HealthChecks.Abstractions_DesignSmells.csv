Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Abstractions\HealthCheckContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Registration
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,IHealthCheckPublisher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Abstractions\IHealthCheckPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Abstractions\HealthCheckContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthCheckContext' Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.IHealthCheck
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks,HealthCheckContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Diagnostics\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Abstractions\HealthCheckContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
