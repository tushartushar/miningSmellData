Insufficient Modularization,Conference.IntegrationTests.ConferenceServiceFixture,given_an_existing_conference_with_a_seat,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mspnp_cqrs-journey-code\source\Conference\Conference.IntegrationTests\ConferenceServiceFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Conference.IntegrationTests.OrderEventHandlerFixture,given_an_order,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mspnp_cqrs-journey-code\source\Conference\Conference.IntegrationTests\OrderEventHandlerFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Conference.IntegrationTests.ConferenceServiceFixture.given_an_existing_conference_with_a_seat
