Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,AspNetLogSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetLogSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,CommContextExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\CommContextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,OpenRastaHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\OpenRastaHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,OpenRastaModule,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\OpenRastaModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,OpenRastaModuleLoader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\OpenRastaModuleLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.AspNetHttpListener,HttpListenerController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetHttpListener\HttpListenerController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,AspNetHost,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConfigurationSourceLocator
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet,AspNetHost,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ConfigurationSourceLocator
Insufficient Modularization,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.AspNetHttpListener,HttpListenerWorkerRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetHttpListener\HttpListenerWorkerRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.AspNetHttpListener,HttpListenerWorkerRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetHttpListener\HttpListenerWorkerRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.AspNetHttpListener,HttpListenerWorkerRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet\AspNetHttpListener\HttpListenerWorkerRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CloseConnection
