Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,Customer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CustomerID' FirstName' LastName
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,finding_types,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\finding_types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,SeekedType,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\finding_types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Deficient Encapsulation,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,aspnet_server_context,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\aspnet_server_context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TheResponse' TheResponseAsString' _port
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,aspnet_server_context,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\aspnet_server_context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration.aspnet_server_context' OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration.context
Broken Hierarchy,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,aspnet_server_context,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\aspnet_server_context.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration.context
Cyclic Hierarchy,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,context,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: aspnet_server_context
Broken Hierarchy,OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration,exception_thrown,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\openrasta_openrasta-core\src\OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration\exception_thrown.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNet.Tests.Integration.aspnet_server_context
