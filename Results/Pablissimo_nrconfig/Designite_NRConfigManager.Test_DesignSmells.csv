Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NRConfigManager.Test.Extensions,TypeDefinitionMemberExtensionsTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Extensions\TypeDefinitionMemberExtensionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetInstrumentationSet_UsesSuppliedPredicateToFilterTypes which is more interested in members of the type: TestInstrumentationDiscoverer
Feature Envy,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetInstrumentationSet_UsesSuppliedInitialContext which is more interested in members of the type: TestInstrumentationDiscoverer
Feature Envy,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetInstrumentationSet_UsesAssemblyLevelContext_IfNoneExplicitlySupplied which is more interested in members of the type: TestInstrumentationDiscoverer
Feature Envy,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetInstrumentationSet_MergesInitialAndAssemblyLevelContext_IfBothSupplied which is more interested in members of the type: TestInstrumentationDiscoverer
Unutilized Abstraction,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationTargetTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationTargetTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,OutputComparisonTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\OutputComparisonTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NRConfigManager.Test.Rendering,ExactMethodMatcherTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Rendering\ExactMethodMatcherTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NRConfigManager.Test.Rendering,ExtensionTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Rendering\ExtensionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationDiscovererBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Modularization,NRConfigManager.Test.Infrastructure,DummyIMethodDetails,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Infrastructure\InstrumentationTargetTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ContainsGenericParameters' GenericArguments' Parameters' Name' DeclaringType' InstrumentationContext' IsCompilerGenerated
Insufficient Modularization,NRConfigManager.Test.Rendering.DiscovererSpecific,RendererCorrectnessTestBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Pablissimo_nrconfig\src\NRConfigManager.Test\Rendering\DiscovererSpecific\RendererCorrectnessTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
