Unnecessary Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Entities,NotificationRecipient,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Entities\NotificationRecipient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Notification' Recipient' ReadDate
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Entities,NotificationRecipient,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Entities\NotificationRecipient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Enums,NotificationType,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Enums\NotificationType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications,NinjectRegistration,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\NinjectRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Specifications,INotification,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Specifications\INotification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Message' Type
Unnecessary Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Specifications,INotificationRecipient,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Specifications\INotificationRecipient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Recipient' ReadDate
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Specifications,INotificationRecipient,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Specifications\INotificationRecipient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Specifications,IRecipientSearchQuery,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Specifications\IRecipientSearchQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FluentNHibernate.Automapping,EntityExtensions,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\T4FluentNH.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Multipath Hierarchy,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Entities,Notification,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Entities\Notification.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: INotification
Broken Hierarchy,PowerArhitecture.Notifications.Entities,NotificationRecipient,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\Entities\NotificationRecipient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): VersionedEntity' INotificationRecipient
Rebellious Hierarchy,PowerArhitecture.Notifications,NinjectRegistration,C:\repos\maca88_PowerArhitecture\Source\PowerArhitecture.Notifications\NinjectRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Load
