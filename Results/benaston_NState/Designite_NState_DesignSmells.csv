Unnecessary Abstraction,NState,IStateTransition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\IStateTransition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartStates' EndStates' TransitionAction' Condition
Unutilized Abstraction,NState,NullStateMachine<TState;TTransitionActionStatus>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\NullStateMachine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NState,StateMachineSerializationHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\StateMachineSerializationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NState,TransitionActionStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\TransitionActionStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NState.Exceptions,TransitionActionException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\Exceptions\TransitionActionException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NState,StateMachineTransitionHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\StateMachineTransitionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NState.StateMachineTransitionHelper' NState.StateMachine<TState'TTransitionActionStatus>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NState,IStateMachine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benaston_NState\src\NState\IStateMachine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NState.IStateMachine' NState.TransitionAction<TState'TTransitionActionStatus>' NState.IStateTransition
