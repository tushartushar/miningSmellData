Duplicate Abstraction,Combot,Bot,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Bot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Bot[813' 833]' Bot[852' 872]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Combot,Constants,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LOGFILEEXT
Unnecessary Abstraction,Combot,BotError,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Message
Duplicate Abstraction,Combot.Configurations,Config,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Configurations\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Config[79' 101]' Config[115' 137]
Unutilized Abstraction,Combot.Configurations,IPAddressConverter,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Configurations\JsonHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Combot.Configurations,IPEndPointConverter,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Configurations\JsonHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Combot,Bot,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Bot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServerConfig' IRC' Database' Modules' Connected' LoggedIn' ConnectionTime' LoadTime' PrivilegeModeMapping' ChannelModeMapping
Unexploited Encapsulation,Combot,Bot,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Bot.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ServerReplyMessage' ServerErrorMessage (in method "HandleReplyEvent" of class "Bot").
Insufficient Modularization,Combot,Bot,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Bot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Combot,Bot,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Bot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 187
Hub-like Modularization,Combot,Bot,D:\newReposJune17\uncled1023_Combot\Combot\Bot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class has high number of incoming as well as outgoing dependencies. Incoming dependecies: Controller' Module' Console_Interface' MainViewModel' About' Channel_Rules' Configuration' Custom_Commands' Decide' Fun' Github' Help' Introductions' Invite' Logging' Messaging' Moderation' Owner_Control' Ping_Me' Quotes' Relay' Search' Sed' Seen' Spam_Control' Timer' Url_Parsing' Version' Weather_Information' Whois' Wolfram_Alpha' YouTube  Outgoing dependencies: ServerConfig' IRC' Database' Module' AccessType' PrivilegeMode' ChannelMode' SpamSession' ErrorType' Channel' Nick' UserMode' MessageType' Command' SpamSourceType' ChannelConfig' JoinChannelInfo' KickInfo' ChannelModeChangeInfo' ServerReplyMessage' ServerErrorMessage' IRCReplyCode' IRCErrorCode' IReply' ChannelMessage' PrivateMessage' PrivateNotice' CommandMessage' UserModeInfo' CommandArgument' BotError' Logger
