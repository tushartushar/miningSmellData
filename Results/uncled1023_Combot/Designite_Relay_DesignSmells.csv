Duplicate Abstraction,Combot.Modules.Plugins,Relay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_Combot\Modules\Relay\Relay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Relay (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_Combot\Modules\Relay\Relay.cs' [89' 114])' Relay (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_Combot\Modules\Relay\Relay.cs' [131' 156])
Feature Envy,Combot.Modules.Plugins,Relay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_Combot\Modules\Relay\Relay.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetRelayList which is more interested in members of the type: Bot

Unutilized Abstraction,Combot.Modules.Plugins,RelayMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_Combot\Modules\Relay\RelayMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Combot.Modules.Plugins,Relay,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\uncled1023_Combot\Modules\Relay\Relay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
