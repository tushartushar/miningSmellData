(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Linq.Dynamic,DynamicOrdering,C:\repos\ezeroone_he\eHorakelle\eZeroOne.Common\DynamicQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Selector' Ascending
Imperative Abstraction,System.Linq.Dynamic,ClassFactory,C:\repos\ezeroone_he\eHorakelle\eZeroOne.Common\DynamicQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetDynamicClass
Multifaceted Abstraction,System.Linq.Dynamic,ExpressionParser,C:\repos\ezeroone_he\eHorakelle\eZeroOne.Common\DynamicQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Linq.Dynamic,DynamicOrdering,C:\repos\ezeroone_he\eHorakelle\eZeroOne.Common\DynamicQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Selector' Ascending
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Linq.Dynamic,Signature,C:\repos\ezeroone_he\eHorakelle\eZeroOne.Common\DynamicQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
