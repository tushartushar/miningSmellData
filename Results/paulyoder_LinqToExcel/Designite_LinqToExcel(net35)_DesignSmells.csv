Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinqToExcel,IAllowFieldTypeConversionExceptions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Domain\IAllowFieldTypeConversionExceptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FieldTypeConversionExceptions
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinqToExcel,IContainsUnmappedCells,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Domain\IContainsUnmappedCells.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UnmappedCells
Unutilized Abstraction,LinqToExcel.Extensions,CommonExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Extensions\CommonExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,LinqToExcel.Query,ExcelQueryExecutor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Query\ExcelQueryExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetWorksheetName which is more interested in members of the type: ExcelQueryArgs
Feature Envy,LinqToExcel.Query,ExcelQueryExecutor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Query\ExcelQueryExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CheckIfInvalidColumnNameUsed which is more interested in members of the type: ExcelQueryArgs
Feature Envy,LinqToExcel.Query,SqlGeneratorQueryModelVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Query\SqlGeneratorQueryModelVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SqlGeneratorQueryModelVisitor which is more interested in members of the type: ExcelQueryArgs
Insufficient Modularization,LinqToExcel,ExcelQueryFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\ExcelQueryFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 49 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LinqToExcel,ExcelQueryFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\ExcelQueryFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LinqToExcel,IExcelQueryFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\IExcelQueryFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,LinqToExcel.Query,ProjectorBuildingExpressionTreeVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Query\ProjectorBuildingExpressionTreeVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: VisitSubQuery
Rebellious Hierarchy,LinqToExcel.Query,SqlGeneratorQueryModelVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Query\SqlGeneratorQueryModelVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: VisitGroupJoinClause' VisitJoinClause
Rebellious Hierarchy,LinqToExcel.Query,WhereClauseExpressionTreeVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulyoder_LinqToExcel\src\LinqToExcel\Query\WhereClauseExpressionTreeVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateUnhandledItemException
