Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.ClientEngine,DataEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Core\DataEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Data' Offset' Length
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.ClientEngine,SslStreamTcpSession,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Core\SslStreamTcpSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Collections.Concurrent,ConcurrentQueue<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Core\ConcurrentQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,System.Net.Security,AsyncResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Core\SslStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AsyncState' AsyncWaitHandle' CompletedSynchronously' IsCompleted' Callback' Exception
Rebellious Hierarchy,SuperSocket.ClientEngine,ClientSession,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Core\ClientSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect' TrySend' TrySend' Close
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Net,NetworkStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Core\NetworkStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength
