Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,SuperSocket.ClientEngine.Proxy,HttpConnectProxy,F:\newReposMay17\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Proxy\HttpConnectProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Connect
Duplicate Abstraction,SuperSocket.ClientEngine.Proxy,HttpConnectProxy,F:\newReposMay17\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Proxy\HttpConnectProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HttpConnectProxy[83' 105]' ReceiveState[101' 123]' Socks5Connector[123' 145]
Duplicate Abstraction,SuperSocket.ClientEngine.Proxy,Socks4aConnector,F:\newReposMay17\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Proxy\Socks4aConnector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Socks4aConnector[89' 112]' ReceiveState[178' 201]
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.ClientEngine.Proxy,ReceiveState,F:\newReposMay17\kerryjiang_SuperSocket.ClientEngine\Proxy\Socks4Connector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
