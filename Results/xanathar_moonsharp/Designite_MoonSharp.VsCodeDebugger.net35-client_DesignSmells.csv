Duplicate Abstraction,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,Message,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Message (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs' [1' 28])' ProtocolMessage (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\Protocol.cs' [1' 28])' Utilities (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\Utilities.cs' [1' 28])
Unutilized Abstraction,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,StackFrame,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,Capabilities,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' supportsConfigurationDoneRequest' supportsFunctionBreakpoints' supportsConditionalBreakpoints' supportsEvaluateForHovers' exceptionBreakpointFilters
Unnecessary Abstraction,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,ResponseBody,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\Protocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,Capabilities,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: supportsConfigurationDoneRequest' supportsFunctionBreakpoints' supportsConditionalBreakpoints' supportsEvaluateForHovers' exceptionBreakpointFilters
Deficient Encapsulation,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,ProtocolMessage,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\Protocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: seq
Deficient Encapsulation,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,Request,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\Protocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: command' arguments
Deficient Encapsulation,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,ProtocolServer,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\Protocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TRACE' TRACE_RESPONSE
Broken Modularization,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,Capabilities,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' supportsConfigurationDoneRequest' supportsFunctionBreakpoints' supportsConditionalBreakpoints' supportsEvaluateForHovers' exceptionBreakpointFilters
Insufficient Modularization,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.SDK,DebugSession,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\SDK\DebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.DebuggerLogic,AsyncDebugger,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\AsyncDebugger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RefreshBreakpoints' SetByteCode
Unfactored Hierarchy,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.DebuggerLogic,EmptyDebugSession,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\EmptyDebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  EmptyDebugSession (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\EmptyDebugSession.cs' [39' 59])' MoonSharpDebugSession (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\MoonSharpDebugSession.cs' [51' 71])
Unfactored Hierarchy,MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger.DebuggerLogic,EmptyDebugSession,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\EmptyDebugSession.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  EmptyDebugSession (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\EmptyDebugSession.cs' [90' 110])' MoonSharpDebugSession (C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\MoonSharp.VsCodeDebugger\DebuggerLogic\MoonSharpDebugSession.cs' [90' 110])
