Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MoonSharp.Debugger,Ext_Methods,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\Ext_Methods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MoonSharp.Debugger,SourceCodeDebugControl,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\SourceCodeDebugControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetBreakpoint
Imperative Abstraction,MoonSharp.Debugger,ValueBrowser,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\ValueBrowser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: StartBrowse
Imperative Abstraction,MoonSharp.Debugger,WatchInputDialog,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\WatchInputDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetNewWatchName
Unnecessary Abstraction,MoonSharp.Debugger.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,MoonSharp.Debugger,MainForm,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 49 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MoonSharp.Debugger,SourceCodeDebugControl,C:\repos\xanathar_moonsharp\src\DevTools\MoonSharp.VmDebugger\SourceCodeDebugControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnPaintBackground
