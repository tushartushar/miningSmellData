Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Prediction_Machine,SettingsForm,C:\repos\Thought-Weaver_Envisage\SettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CloseThis
Unnecessary Abstraction,Prediction_Machine,globalvariables,C:\repos\Thought-Weaver_Envisage\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DefaultBackgroundColor' ToPredict
Unnecessary Abstraction,Prediction_Machine.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\Thought-Weaver_Envisage\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Prediction_Machine,globalvariables,C:\repos\Thought-Weaver_Envisage\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultBackgroundColor' ToPredict
Deficient Encapsulation,Prediction_Machine,globalvariables,C:\repos\Thought-Weaver_Envisage\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultBackgroundColor' ToPredict
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Prediction_Machine,SettingsForm,C:\repos\Thought-Weaver_Envisage\SettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SettingsForm' MainForm
