Duplicate Abstraction,RaidarGadget,CircularLogBuffer,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\CircularLogBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CircularLogBuffer[1' 23]' MessageEventArgs[1' 23]
Duplicate Abstraction,RaidarGadget,CircularLogBuffer,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\CircularLogBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CircularLogBuffer[1' 22]' App[1' 22]' MessageEventArgs[1' 22]
Duplicate Abstraction,RaidarGadget,CircularLogBuffer,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\CircularLogBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CircularLogBuffer[4' 23]' Status[5' 24]' RaidarGadgetPage[5' 24]' MessageEventArgs[4' 23]
Duplicate Abstraction,RaidarGadget,Status,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Status[1' 23]' RaidarGadgetPage[1' 23]
Unutilized Abstraction,RaidarGadget,Criticality,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,RaidarGadget,RaidInfo,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Multifaceted Abstraction,RaidarGadget,RaidarGadgetPage,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidarGadgetPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,RaidarGadget,RaidarGadgetPage,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidarGadgetPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RaidarGadget.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' MyIP' PollNasRate' defaultInstance
Missing Hierarchy,RaidarGadget,RaidStatusMap,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: RaidDisk' RaidVolume' RaidUPS (in method "GetStatusString" of class "RaidStatusMap").
Missing Hierarchy,RaidarGadget,RaidStatusMap,C:\repos\TheGarf_RaidarGadget\RaidInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: RaidTemperature' RaidFan (in method "GetStatusString" of class "RaidStatusMap").
