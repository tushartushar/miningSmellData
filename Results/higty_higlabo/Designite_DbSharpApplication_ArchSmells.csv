Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,DbSharpApplication,HigLabo.DbSharpApplication,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: HigLabo.DbSharpApplication' HigLabo.DbSharpApplication.Core
Unstable Dependency,DbSharpApplication,HigLabo.DbSharpApplication.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): HigLabo.DbSharpApplication
Feature Concentration,DbSharpApplication,HigLabo.DbSharpApplication,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DeleteObjectWindow' MainWindow' MainWindowState' ManageConnectionStringWindow' ManageIgnoreObjectWindow' MessageWindow' ProgressWindow' SchemaFileInfo' StoredProcedureFilter' EditConnectionStringWindow' EditConnectionStringWindowSavedEventArgs' EditSettingsWindow' GenerateSourceCodeWindow' GenerateSqlScriptWindow' ImportObjectGenerateFileWindow' ImportObjectWindow]' [App]' [DataTypeLengthConverter]' [ProgressListBoxDataTemplateSelector].
