Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Mime,TransferEncodingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Core\TransferEncoding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,HigLabo.Mime,MailHeaderCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mail\MailHeaderCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Duplicate Abstraction,HigLabo.Mime,MimeContent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeContent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MimeContent (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeContent.cs' [18' 62])' MimeMessage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeMessage.cs' [81' 125])
Feature Envy,HigLabo.Mime,MimeParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeParser.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MimeParser which is more interested in members of the type: MimeParserDefaultSettings
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Mime.Internal,EncodingExtentions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\Internal\EncodingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Mime,MimeParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 118
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HigLabo.Mime,MailMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mail\MailMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HigLabo.Mime.MailMessage' HigLabo.Mime.MimeMessage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HigLabo.Mime,MimeParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HigLabo.Mime.MimeParser' HigLabo.Mime.Internal.MimeStreamBuffer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HigLabo.Mime,MailMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mail\MailMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HigLabo.Mime.MailMessage' HigLabo.Mime.MimeContent' HigLabo.Mime.MimeMessage
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Mime,MailMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mail\MailMessage.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Mime.MimeMessage
Cyclic Hierarchy,HigLabo.Mime,MimeMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\MimeMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MailMessage
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Mime.Internal,MimeHeaderBufferByteArray,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mime\Mime\Internal\MimeHeaderBufferByteArray.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Converter.BufferByteArray
