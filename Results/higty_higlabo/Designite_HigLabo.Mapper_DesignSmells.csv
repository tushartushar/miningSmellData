Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Core,ILGeneratorExtensions,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ILGeneratorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,HigLabo.Core,ObjectMapConfigMethodAttribute,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ObjectMapConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Core,ObjectMapExtensions,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ObjectMapExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Core,ObjectMapFailureException,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ObjectMapFailureException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Core,ObjectMapConfig,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ObjectMapConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Core,ObjectMapConfig,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ObjectMapConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Core,ObjectMapConfig,C:\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Mapper\Core\ObjectMapConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 149
