Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Net.Ftp,FtpClient,F:\newReposMay17\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Net.Ftp\Core\FtpClient.Async.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 89 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Net.Ftp,FtpClient,F:\newReposMay17\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Net.Ftp\Core\FtpClient.Async.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 99 methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Net.Ftp,FtpClient,F:\newReposMay17\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Net.Ftp\Core\FtpClient.Async.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 176
