Imperative Abstraction,HigLabo.CodeGenerator.Json,JsonParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator.Json\Core\Internal\JsonParser.ClassInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.CodeGenerator.Json,JsonParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator.Json\Core\Internal\JsonParser.ClassInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,HigLabo.CodeGenerator.Json,RegexList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator.Json\Core\JsonParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ElementChars
