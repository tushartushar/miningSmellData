Imperative Abstraction,HigLabo.Data,CommandErrorEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandErrorEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Duplicate Abstraction,HigLabo.Data,CommandErrorEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandErrorEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CommandErrorEventArgs (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandErrorEventArgs.cs' [12' 35])' CommandExecutedEventArgs (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandExecutedEventArgs.cs' [12' 35])
Imperative Abstraction,HigLabo.Data,CommandExecutedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandExecutedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Imperative Abstraction,HigLabo.Data,CommandExecutingEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandExecutingEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Data,CommandResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\CommandResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,HigLabo.Data.SqlServer,CreateDatabaseStatement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Database\CreateDatabaseStatement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateStatement
Unutilized Abstraction,HigLabo.Data.SqlServer,CreateDatabaseStatement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Database\CreateDatabaseStatement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Data,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.Data,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Common\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,ConnectionException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\ConnectionException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,DeadLockException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\DeadLockException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,ForeignKeyException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\ForeignKeyException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,LockTimeoutException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\LockTimeoutException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,LoginException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\LoginException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,TimeoutException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\TimeoutException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
Broken Hierarchy,HigLabo.Data,UniqueConstraintException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.Data\Exception\UniqueConstraintException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HigLabo.Data.DatabaseException
