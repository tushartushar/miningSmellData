Duplicate Abstraction,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CSharpSourceCodeGenerator (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs' [269' 292])' CSharpSourceCodeGenerator (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs' [540' 563])
Deficient Encapsulation,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,SourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\SourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NewLine
Deficient Encapsulation,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,SourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\SourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NewLine
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,SourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\SourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 45 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,SourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\SourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.

Insufficient Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,VisualBasicSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\VisualBasicSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HigLabo.CodeGenerator.CSharpSourceCodeGenerator' HigLabo.CodeGenerator.SourceCodeGenerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,VisualBasicSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\VisualBasicSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HigLabo.CodeGenerator.VisualBasicSourceCodeGenerator' HigLabo.CodeGenerator.SourceCodeGenerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HigLabo.CodeGenerator.CSharpSourceCodeGenerator' HigLabo.CodeGenerator.SourceCodeGenerator' HigLabo.CodeGenerator.VisualBasicSourceCodeGenerator
Cyclic Hierarchy,HigLabo.CodeGenerator,SourceCodeGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\higty_higlabo\HigLabo.CodeGenerator\CodeGenerator\SourceCodeGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CSharpSourceCodeGenerator
