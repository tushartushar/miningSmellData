Deficient Encapsulation,MonkeyWrench.Test,Runner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TemporaryTestDirectory' SourceDirectory' MonkeyWrenchXml_FileName' TEST_DATABASE_PORT' TEST_DB_ROOT_DIR' TEST_DATA_DIR' TEST_DATABASE_DIR' Assertions
Deficient Encapsulation,MonkeyWrench.Test,Runner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TemporaryTestDirectory' SourceDirectory' MonkeyWrenchXml_FileName' TEST_DATABASE_PORT' TEST_DB_ROOT_DIR' TEST_DATA_DIR' TEST_DATABASE_DIR' Assertions
Deficient Encapsulation,MonkeyWrench.Test,CommitObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\VCTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Files' Contents' Message' Author' EMail
Broken Modularization,MonkeyWrench.Test,CommitObject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\VCTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Files' Contents' Message' Author' EMail
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonkeyWrench.Test,Database,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MonkeyWrench.Test.Database' MonkeyWrench.Test.TestBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonkeyWrench.Test,Runner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MonkeyWrench.Test.Runner' MonkeyWrench.Test.Database
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MonkeyWrench.Test,Check,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\Attributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MonkeyWrench.Test.Check' MonkeyWrench.Test.TestBase' MonkeyWrench.Test.Database' MonkeyWrench.Test.Runner
Broken Hierarchy,MonkeyWrench.Test,VCTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_monkeywrench\MonkeyWrench.Test\VCTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MonkeyWrench.Test.TestBase
