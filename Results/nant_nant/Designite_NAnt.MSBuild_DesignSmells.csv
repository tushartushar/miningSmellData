Feature Envy,NAnt.MSBuild,MSBuildEngine,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\MSBuildEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateMSEngine which is more interested in members of the type: Engine
Imperative Abstraction,NAnt.MSBuild,NAntLogger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\NAntLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Deficient Encapsulation,NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine,Loader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\BuildEngine\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: framework' engine
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NAnt.MSBuild,MSBuildAssemblyReference,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\MSBuildAssemblyReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildAssemblyReference' NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildProject
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NAnt.MSBuild,MSBuildConfiguration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\MSBuildConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildConfiguration' NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildProject
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NAnt.MSBuild,MSBuildAssemblyReference,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\MSBuildAssemblyReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildAssemblyReference' NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildProject' NAnt.MSBuild.MSBuildConfiguration
Rebellious Hierarchy,NAnt.MSBuild,DummyTask,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\NAntLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteTask
Unfactored Hierarchy,NAnt.VSNet,WhidbeySolution,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2005\WhidbeySolution.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  WhidbeySolution (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2005\WhidbeySolution.cs' [1' 21])' OrcasSolution (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2008\OrcasSolution.cs' [1' 21])
Broken Hierarchy,NAnt.VSNet,WhidbeySolution,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2005\WhidbeySolution.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NAnt.VSNet.SolutionBase
Unfactored Hierarchy,NAnt.VSNet,WhidbeySolutionProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2005\WhidbeySolutionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  WhidbeySolutionProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2005\WhidbeySolutionProvider.cs' [3' 26])' OrcasSolutionProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2008\OrcasSolutionProvider.cs' [3' 26])' RosarioSolutionProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2010\RosarioSolutionProvider.cs' [3' 26])
Unfactored Hierarchy,NAnt.VSNet,OrcasSolutionProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2008\OrcasSolutionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  OrcasSolutionProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2008\OrcasSolutionProvider.cs' [1' 21])' RosarioSolutionProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nant_nant\src\NAnt.MSBuild\VS2010\RosarioSolutionProvider.cs' [1' 21])
