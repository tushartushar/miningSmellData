Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Feature Concentration,NAnt.MSBuild,NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BuildItem' BuildItemGroup' BuildItemEnumerator' Project' Engine' Loader]' [BuildPropertyGroup]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29,NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine.BuildPropertyGroup

Scattered Functionality,NAnt.MSBuild,NAnt.MSBuild,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine' NAnt.Core,NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine.Engine' NAnt.Core.Task' NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine.Project' NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine.BuildPropertyGroup' NAnt.Core.Project' NAnt.Core.Element' NAnt.MSBuild.BuildEngine.BuildItem
