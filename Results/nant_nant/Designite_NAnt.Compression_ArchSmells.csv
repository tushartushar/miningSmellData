Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Feature Concentration,NAnt.Compression,NAnt.Compression.Tasks,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ExpandBaseTask' UnTarTask' UnZipTask]' [GUnzip]' [TarTask]' [ZipTask]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67,NAnt.Compression.Tasks.GUnzip' NAnt.Compression.Tasks.TarTask' NAnt.Compression.Tasks.ZipTask
