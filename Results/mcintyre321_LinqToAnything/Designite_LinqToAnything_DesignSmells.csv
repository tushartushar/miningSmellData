Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,LinqToAnything,DelegateQueryable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\DelegateQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinqToAnything,SelectCallMatch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\ExpressionUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MethodCall' Source' Lambda' LambdaBody
Unutilized Abstraction,LinqToAnything,QueryInfoExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\QueryInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LinqToAnything,SwitchoutArgumentVisitor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\SwitchoutArgumentVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LinqToAnything,SwitchoutVisitor<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\SwitchoutVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LinqToAnything,DelegateQueryable<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\DelegateQueryable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LinqToAnything.DelegateQueryable<T>' LinqToAnything.QueryProvider<T>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LinqToAnything.HelperTypes,Grouping,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\HelperTypes\Grouping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LinqToAnything.HelperTypes.Grouping' LinqToAnything.HelperTypes.Grouping<TKey'TElement>
Cyclic Hierarchy,LinqToAnything.HelperTypes,Grouping,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mcintyre321_LinqToAnything\LinqToAnything\HelperTypes\Grouping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Grouping<TKey'TElement>
