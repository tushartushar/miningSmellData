Unnecessary Abstraction,Demo.IronSharpConsole,SampleClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,Demo.IronSharpConsole,SampleClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
