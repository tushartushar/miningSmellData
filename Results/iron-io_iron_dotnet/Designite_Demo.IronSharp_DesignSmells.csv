Unnecessary Abstraction,Demo.IronSharpConsole,SampleClass,C:\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,Demo.IronSharpConsole,SampleClass,C:\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Demo.IronSharpConsole.Tests,IntegrationTests,C:\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Duplicate Abstraction,Demo.IronSharpConsole.Tests,IntegrationTests,C:\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IntegrationTests (C:\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Tests\IntegrationTests.cs' [13' 44])' LongRunningIntegrationTests (C:\repos\iron-io_iron_dotnet\src\Demo.IronSharp\Tests\LongRunningIntegrationTests.cs' [15' 46])
