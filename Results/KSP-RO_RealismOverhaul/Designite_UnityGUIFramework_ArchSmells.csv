Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,UnityGUIFramework,UnityGUIFramework.Controls,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: UnityGUIFramework.Controls' UnityGUIFramework,UnityGUIFramework.Controls.LayoutControl' UnityGUIFramework.GUIFramework
Unstable Dependency,UnityGUIFramework,UnityGUIFramework.Controls,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): UnityGUIFramework,UnityGUIFramework.Controls.LayoutDirection
Feature Concentration,UnityGUIFramework,UnityGUIFramework,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DebugHelper' GUIFramework' GUIWindow' PropertyTypeInitializerContainer]' [LayoutDirection' LayoutHelper]' [ObservableList<T>]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.43,UnityGUIFramework.LayoutDirection' UnityGUIFramework.LayoutHelper' UnityGUIFramework.ObservableList<T>
