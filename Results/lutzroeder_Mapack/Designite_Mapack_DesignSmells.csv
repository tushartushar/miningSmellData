Imperative Abstraction,Mapack,CholeskyDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\CholeskyDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Solve
Unutilized Abstraction,Mapack,CholeskyDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\CholeskyDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mapack,EigenvalueDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\EigenvalueDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Mapack,EigenvalueDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\EigenvalueDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EigenvalueDecomposition[926' 951]' QrDecomposition[237' 262]
Duplicate Abstraction,Mapack,EigenvalueDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\EigenvalueDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EigenvalueDecomposition[930' 951]' Matrix[718' 739]' SingularValueDecomposition[510' 531]' QrDecomposition[241' 262]
Imperative Abstraction,Mapack,LuDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\LuDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Solve
Duplicate Abstraction,Mapack,Matrix,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\Matrix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Matrix[434' 459]' Matrix[484' 509]
Imperative Abstraction,Mapack,QrDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\QrDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Solve
Unutilized Abstraction,Mapack,SingularValueDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\SingularValueDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Mapack,EigenvalueDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\EigenvalueDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 167
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mapack,LuDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\LuDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LuDecomposition' Matrix
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mapack,LuDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\LuDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LuDecomposition' Matrix' QrDecomposition' Matrix
Insufficient Modularization,Mapack,Matrix,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\Matrix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mapack,QrDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\QrDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QrDecomposition' Matrix
Insufficient Modularization,Mapack,SingularValueDecomposition,C:\repos\lutzroeder_Mapack\Source\SingularValueDecomposition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 115
