Cyclic Hierarchy,System.Windows,DependencyObject,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\DependencyObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: UIElement
Cyclic Hierarchy,System.Windows,DependencyObject,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\DependencyObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: FrameworkElement
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows,FrameworkElement,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\FrameworkElement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Draw
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows,Window,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\Window.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnGotFocus
Missing Hierarchy,System.Windows.Markup,XamlReader,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\Markup\XamlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ResourceDictionary' ResourceDictionary' ContentControl (in method "ReadElement" of class "XamlReader").
Broken Hierarchy,System.Windows.Media.Animation,Timeline,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\Media\Animation\Timeline.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Windows.DependencyObject
Cyclic Hierarchy,System.Windows.Media,Brush,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\Media\Brush.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SolidColorBrush
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows.Media,ImageBrush,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\Media\ImageBrush.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetPixel
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Windows.Media,RadialGradientBrush,C:\repos\ronnycsharp_WPFLight\WPFLight\System\Windows\Media\RadialGradientBrush.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
