Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Karcero.Engine.Contracts,IBaseCell,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Contracts\IBaseCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Row' Column
Unnecessary Abstraction,Karcero.Engine.Contracts,IBinaryCell,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Contracts\IBinaryCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsOpen' Sides
Unnecessary Abstraction,Karcero.Engine.Contracts,ICell,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Contracts\ICell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Terrain
Feature Envy,Karcero.Engine.Helpers,DungeonConfigurationGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Helpers\DungeonConfigurationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DungeonOfSize which is more interested in members of the type: DungeonConfiguration
Feature Envy,Karcero.Engine.Helpers,DungeonConfigurationGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Helpers\DungeonConfigurationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WithRoomSize which is more interested in members of the type: DungeonConfiguration
Feature Envy,Karcero.Engine.Helpers,DungeonConfigurationGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Helpers\DungeonConfigurationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WrapUp which is more interested in members of the type: DungeonConfiguration
Unnecessary Abstraction,Karcero.Engine.Models,Cell,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Models\Cell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Row' Column' Terrain
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Engine.Models,Extensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Models\Cell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Karcero.Engine.Helpers,DungeonConfigurationGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Helpers\DungeonConfigurationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Karcero.Engine.Helpers,DungeonConfigurationGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\Helpers\DungeonConfigurationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Karcero.Engine,DungeonGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Engine\DungeonGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Karcero.Engine.DungeonGenerator<T>' Karcero.Engine.Helpers.DungeonConfigurationGenerator<T>
