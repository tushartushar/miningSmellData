Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,BenchmarkTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\BenchmarkTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,DeadendsRemoverTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\DeadendsRemoverTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,DoorGeneratorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\DoorGeneratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,DungeonConfigurationGeneratorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\DungeonConfigurationGeneratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,DungeonGeneratorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\DungeonGeneratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,MapDoublerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\MapDoublerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,MazeGeneratorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\MazeGeneratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,RandomizerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\RandomizerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,RoomGeneratorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\RoomGeneratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Karcero.Tests,RoomGeneratorTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\RoomGeneratorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProcessMap_GenerateRooms_AllRoomSizesAreInRange which is more interested in members of the type: DungeonConfiguration
Unutilized Abstraction,Karcero.Tests,SparsenessReducerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\SparsenessReducerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Karcero.Tests,BenchmarkResultsHtmlWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OdedW_karcero\Karcero.Tests\BenchmarkTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteTotalRunningTime
