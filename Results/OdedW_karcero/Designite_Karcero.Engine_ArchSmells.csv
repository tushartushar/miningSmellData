Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Karcero.Engine' Karcero.Engine.Helpers
Unstable Dependency,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine.Helpers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Karcero.Engine
Unstable Dependency,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine.Models,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Karcero.Engine.Helpers
Feature Concentration,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine.Contracts,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IBaseCell' IBinaryCell' ICell]' [IMapConverter' IRandomizer' IMapPreProcessor' IMapProcessor]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29
Feature Concentration,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine.Models,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Size' Room' BinaryCell' Direction' Extensions' Map]' [Tuple]' [Cell' TerrainType]' [DungeonConfiguration]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.4
Feature Concentration,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine.Processors,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DeadendsRemover]' [DoorGenerator]' [MapDoubler]' [MazeGenerator]' [RoomGenerator]' [SparsenessReducer]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1
Scattered Functionality,Karcero.Engine,Karcero.Engine.Processors,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Karcero.Engine.Contracts' Karcero.Engine.Models
