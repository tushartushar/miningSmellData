Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Squirrel.Update,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: executeCommandLine which is more interested in members of the type: StartupOption
Feature Envy,Mono.Options,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Deficient Encapsulation,Squirrel.Update,WINTRUST_FILE_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\AuthenticodeTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cbStruct' pcwszFilePath' hFile' pgKnownSubject
Deficient Encapsulation,Squirrel.Update,WINTRUST_DATA,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\AuthenticodeTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: cbStruct' pPolicyCallbackData' pSIPCallbackData' dwUIChoice' fdwRevocationChecks' dwUnionChoice' pInfoStruct' dwStateAction' hWVTStateData' dwProvFlags' dwUIContext
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Options,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 114
Rebellious Hierarchy,Mono.Options,Category,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Squirrel_Squirrel.Windows\src\Update\Mono.Options\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnParseComplete
