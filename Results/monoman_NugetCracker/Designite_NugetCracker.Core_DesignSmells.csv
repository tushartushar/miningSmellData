Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NugetCracker.Interfaces,IFile,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Components\IFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FullPath' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,NugetCracker.Interfaces,INugetPackage,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Interfaces\INugetPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Source
Unutilized Abstraction,NugetCracker.Interfaces,INugetSource,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Interfaces\INugetSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NugetCracker.Interfaces,IReference,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Interfaces\IReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Version' Platform
Unutilized Abstraction,NugetCracker.Data,LayeredDependencies,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Data\ComponentsList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NugetCracker,Extensions,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,NugetCracker.Commands,BumpVersionCommand,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Commands\BumpVersionCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IVersionable' IProject (in method "BumpVersion" of class "BumpVersionCommand").
Unexploited Encapsulation,NugetCracker.Utilities,BuildHelper,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Utilities\BuildHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IProject' INugetSpec (in method "Build" of class "BuildHelper").
Insufficient Modularization,NugetCracker.Components.CSharp,CSharpProject,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Components\CSharp\CSharpProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NugetCracker.Components.CSharp,CSharpProject,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Components\CSharp\CSharpProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Cyclic Hierarchy,NugetCracker.Components.CSharp,CSharpProject,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Components\CSharp\CSharpProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: CSharpNugetProject
Rebellious Hierarchy,NugetCracker.Components.CSharp,CSharpWebsite,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Components\CSharp\CSharpWebsite.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdatePackageReferencesOnProject' ReplaceProjectByNuget
Rebellious Hierarchy,NugetCracker.Components,Solution,C:\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\NugetCracker.Core\Components\Solution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: InstallPackageDependencyFromSources
