Feature Envy,NuGet.Dialog,PackageManagerWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\Dialog10\PackageManagerWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetupProviders which is more interested in members of the type: IProviderSettings
Imperative Abstraction,NuGet.Dialog.Providers,PackageItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\Dialog10\PackageItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateEnabledStatus
Insufficient Modularization,NuGet.Dialog.Providers,PackagesProviderBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\Dialog10\Providers\PackagesProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,NuGet.Dialog.Providers,RecentProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\Dialog10\Providers\RecentProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  RecentProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\Dialog10\Providers\RecentProvider.cs' [37' 107])' SolutionRecentProvider (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\Dialog10\Providers\SolutionRecentProvider.cs' [34' 104])
