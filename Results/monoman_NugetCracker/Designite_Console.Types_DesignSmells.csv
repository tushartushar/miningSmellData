Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGetConsole,DisplayNameAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\DisplayNameAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGetConsole,HostNameAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\HostNameAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGetConsole,ICommandTokenizerProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\ICommandTokenizerProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGetConsole,IConsoleInitializer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\IConsoleInitializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetConsole,IAsyncHost,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\IHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetConsole,IHostMetadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\IHostMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HostName' DisplayName
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGetConsole,IHostMetadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\IHostMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetConsole,IConsoleStatus,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\IConsoleStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsBusy
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NuGetConsole,IConsole,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\src\VsConsole\Console.Types\IConsole.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NuGetConsole.IConsole' NuGetConsole.IHost
