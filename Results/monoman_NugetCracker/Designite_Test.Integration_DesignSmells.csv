Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.Test.Integration,CommandRunner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\test\Test.Integration\CommandRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGet.Test.Integration.NuGetCommandLine,NuGetCommandLineTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\monoman_NugetCracker\Nuget\test\Test.Integration\NuGetCommandLine\NuGetCommandLineTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
