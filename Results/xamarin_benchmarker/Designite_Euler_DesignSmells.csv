Deficient Encapsulation,Euler,Tunnel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: size' datasizes' machff' secondOrderDamping' fourthOrderDamping' ntime' scale' error
Deficient Encapsulation,Euler,Statevector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: a' b' c' d
Deficient Encapsulation,Euler,Vector2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ihat' jhat
Broken Hierarchy,Euler,Euler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Euler.Tunnel
