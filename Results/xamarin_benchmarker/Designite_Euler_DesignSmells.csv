Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Euler,Tunnel,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Euler,Tunnel,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: size' datasizes' machff' secondOrderDamping' fourthOrderDamping' ntime' scale' error
Deficient Encapsulation,Euler,Statevector,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: a' b' c' d
Deficient Encapsulation,Euler,Vector2,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ihat' jhat
Broken Hierarchy,Euler,Euler,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tests\csgrande\Euler\Euler\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Euler.Tunnel
