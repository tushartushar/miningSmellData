Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DbTool,MainClass,D:\newReposJune17\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\dbtool\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarker.Models,RunMetric,D:\newReposJune17\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Metric' Value' PhaseName' MetricName' ApiValue
Deficient Encapsulation,Benchmarker.Models,RunSet,D:\newReposJune17\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\RunSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DATETIME_FORMAT' DATETIME_PRETTY
Deficient Encapsulation,Benchmarker.Models,RunSet,D:\newReposJune17\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\RunSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DATETIME_FORMAT' DATETIME_PRETTY
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Benchmarker.Models,Commit,D:\newReposJune17\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Commit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Commit' RunSet
Broken Modularization,Benchmarker.Models,RunMetric,D:\newReposJune17\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Metric' Value' PhaseName' MetricName' ApiValue
