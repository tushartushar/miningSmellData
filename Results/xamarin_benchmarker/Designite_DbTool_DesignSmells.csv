Imperative Abstraction,DbTool,MainClass,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\dbtool\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarker,Value,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libpostgres\PostgresInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' type' v
Unnecessary Abstraction,Benchmarker.Models,RunMetric,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Metric' Value' PhaseName' MetricName' ApiValue
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmarker.Models,MetricType,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmarker.Models,TrustAllCertificatePolicy,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\HttpApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Benchmarker,Value,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libpostgres\PostgresInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: type' v
Deficient Encapsulation,Benchmarker.Models,RunSet,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\RunSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DATETIME_FORMAT' DATETIME_PRETTY
Deficient Encapsulation,Benchmarker.Models,RunSet,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\RunSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DATETIME_FORMAT' DATETIME_PRETTY
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Benchmarker.Models,Commit,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Commit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Benchmarker.Models.Commit' Benchmarker.Models.RunSet
Broken Modularization,Benchmarker.Models,RunMetric,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Metric' Value' PhaseName' MetricName' ApiValue
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Benchmarker.Models,RunSet,C:\repos\xamarin_benchmarker\tools\libdbmodel\RunSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Benchmarker.Models.RunSet' Benchmarker.Models.Commit
