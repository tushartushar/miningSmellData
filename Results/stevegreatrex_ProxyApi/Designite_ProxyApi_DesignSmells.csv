Unnecessary Abstraction,ProxyApi,IProxyGeneratorConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\IProxyGeneratorConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InclusionRule' PathUtility' AssemblyProvider
Unutilized Abstraction,ProxyApi,JSDocTypeExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\JSDocTypeExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ProxyApi,ApiBootstrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ApiBootstrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ProxyApi,ValidateHttpAntiForgeryTokenAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ValidateHttpAntiForgeryToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProxyApi.ElementDefinitions,ParameterDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ElementDefinitions\ParameterDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Index' Type
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProxyApi.ElementDefinitions,IParameterDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ElementDefinitions\IParameterDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Index' Type
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProxyApi.ElementDefinitions,IActionMethodDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ElementDefinitions\IActionMethodDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' Url' UrlParameters' BodyParameter
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProxyApi.ElementDefinitions,IControllerDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ElementDefinitions\IControllerDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ActionMethods' Name' UrlName' Type
Unutilized Abstraction,ProxyApi.Reflection,ReflectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\Reflection\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ProxyApi.Factories,ActionMethodDefinitionFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\Factories\ActionMethodDefinitionFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetUrl which is more interested in members of the type: IPathUtility
Imperative Abstraction,ProxyApi.Templates,ProxyTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\Templates\ProxyTemplate.Parameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: TransformText
Broken Modularization,ProxyApi.ElementDefinitions,IActionMethodDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\ElementDefinitions\IActionMethodDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Name' Url' UrlParameters' BodyParameter
Broken Hierarchy,ProxyApi.Templates,ProxyTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\stevegreatrex_ProxyApi\ProxyApi\Templates\ProxyTemplate.Parameters.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ProxyApi.Templates.ProxyTemplateBase
