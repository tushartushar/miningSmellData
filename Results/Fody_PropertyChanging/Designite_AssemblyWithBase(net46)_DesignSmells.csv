Duplicate Abstraction,AssemblyWithBase.BaseWithGenericParent,BaseClass1<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_PropertyChanging\TestAssemblies\AssemblyWithBase\BaseWithGenericParent\BaseClass1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: AssemblyWithBase.BaseWithGenericParent.BaseClass1<T>' AssemblyWithBase.GenericFromAbove.BaseClass1<T>
Unnecessary Abstraction,AssemblyWithBase.BaseWithGenericParent,BaseClass2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_PropertyChanging\TestAssemblies\AssemblyWithBase\BaseWithGenericParent\BaseClass2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AssemblyWithBase.BaseWithGenericParent,BaseClass2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_PropertyChanging\TestAssemblies\AssemblyWithBase\BaseWithGenericParent\BaseClass2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
