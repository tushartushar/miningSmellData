Unexloited Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Entity3D,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Entity3D.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Vector3D' Quaternion (in method "SetWithoutInterpolation" of class "Entity3D").
Unexloited Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Entity3D,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Entity3D.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Vector3D' Quaternion (in method "Set" of class "Entity3D").
Deficient Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,MeshAnimationFrameData,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\MeshAnimationFrameData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TransformsOfBones
Deficient Encapsulation,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D.Cameras,CameraPath,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Cameras\CameraPath.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ViewMatrices
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Billboard,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Billboard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Billboard' BillboardRenderer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Model,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Model.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Model' ModelRenderer
Broken Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Billboard,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Billboard.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Entity3D
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Mesh,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Mesh.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DisposeData
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,MeshAnimation,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\MeshAnimation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DisposeData
Broken Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,Model,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\Model.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HierarchyEntity3D
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering3D,ModelData,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Rendering3D\ModelData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
