Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Graphics.OpenTK20,OpenTKShader,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Graphics\OpenTK20\OpenTKShader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Insufficient Modularization,DeltaEngine.Graphics.OpenTK20,OpenTK20Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Graphics\OpenTK20\OpenTK20Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DeltaEngine.Graphics.OpenTK20,OpenTK20Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Graphics\OpenTK20\OpenTK20Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 47 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Graphics.OpenTK20,OpenTK20Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.OpenTK\Graphics\OpenTK20\OpenTK20Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OpenTK20Device' OpenGL20CircularBuffer
