Unnecessary Abstraction,AMClasses,MessageForDebug,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jestonedev_ActivityManager\AmClasses\MessageForDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AMClasses,MessageForDebug,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jestonedev_ActivityManager\AmClasses\MessageForDebug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AMClasses,PlugActionHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jestonedev_ActivityManager\AmClasses\PlugActionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AMClasses,PlugIncludeRule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jestonedev_ActivityManager\AmClasses\PlugIncludeRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AMClasses,PlugInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jestonedev_ActivityManager\AmClasses\PlugInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AMClasses.PlugInfo' AMClasses.PlugActionInfo
