Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Azure,ConsoleExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\AzureSupport\Console.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Azure,ConsoleExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\AzureSupport\Console.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConsoleExtensionMethods (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\AzureSupport\Console.cs' [1' 20])' NamespaceDoc (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\AzureSupport\Storage.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Azure,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\AzureSupport\Storage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
