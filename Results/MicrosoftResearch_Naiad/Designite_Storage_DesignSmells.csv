Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs.NamespaceDoc' Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.NamespaceDoc
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NamespaceDoc (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs' [1' 21])' NamespaceDoc (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Storage.cs' [1' 21])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,DfsBlock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' path' fileLength' offset' length' dataNodeAddress
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,DfsFileCoordinator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,DfsTextCoordinator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,DfsTextWorker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage,NamespaceDoc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Storage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage,Utils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Storage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,DfsBlock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: path' fileLength' offset' length' dataNodeAddress
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Frameworks.Storage.Dfs,DfsBlock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\Frameworks\Storage\Dfs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' path' fileLength' offset' length' dataNodeAddress
