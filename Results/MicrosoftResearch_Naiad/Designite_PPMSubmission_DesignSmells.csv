Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Cluster,ClusterSubmission,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\ClusterSubmission\NaiadPeloponneseSupport\ClusterSubmission.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ClusterSubmission (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\ClusterSubmission\NaiadPeloponneseSupport\ClusterSubmission.cs' [1' 24])' PPMSubmission (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\ClusterSubmission\NaiadPeloponneseSupport\PPMSubmission.cs' [1' 24])

Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Util,Flags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\ClusterSubmission\NaiadPeloponneseSupport\Flags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Research.Naiad.Util,Flag,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MicrosoftResearch_Naiad\ClusterSubmission\NaiadPeloponneseSupport\Flags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _boolValue' IsSet
