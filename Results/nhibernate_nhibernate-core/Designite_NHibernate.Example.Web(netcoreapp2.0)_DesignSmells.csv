Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.Example.Web.Models,Item,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Models\Item.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Price' Description
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,ErrorModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\Error.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,IndexModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\Index.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,InsertItemModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\InsertItem.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,InsertItemModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\InsertItem.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnPost which is more interested in members of the type: ISession
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,InsertItemEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\InsertItem.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Feature Envy,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,ViewDataModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\ViewData.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnGet which is more interested in members of the type: ISession
Feature Envy,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,ViewDataModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\ViewData.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnPostDelete which is more interested in members of the type: ISession
Feature Envy,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,ViewDataModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\ViewData.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnPostUpdate which is more interested in members of the type: ISession
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.Example.Web.Pages,UpdateItemEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nhibernate_nhibernate-core\src\NHibernate.Example.Web\Pages\ViewData.cshtml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
