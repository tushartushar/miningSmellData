Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,OpenSSL.CLI,CmdCipher,F:\newReposMay17\lachesis_scallion\openssl-net-0.5\cli\CmdCipher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenSSL.CLI,CmdGenRSA,F:\newReposMay17\lachesis_scallion\openssl-net-0.5\cli\CmdGenRSA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CmdGenRSA[1' 28]' CmdRSA[1' 28]' CmdDH[1' 28]' CmdGenDH[1' 28]' Option[1' 28]' ICommand[1' 28]
