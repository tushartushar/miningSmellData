Unnecessary Abstraction,XDMessaging.Config,Settings,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\Config\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IoStreamMessageTimeoutInMilliseconds
Unutilized Abstraction,XDMessaging.Entities,Broadcasters,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\Entities\Broadcasters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XDMessaging.Entities,Listeners,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\Entities\Listeners.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XDMessaging,IXDBroadcaster,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\IXDBroadcaster.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XDMessaging,RegisterWithClient,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\Transport\IOStream\RegisterWithClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XDMessaging,XDMessageEventArgs,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\XDMessageEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XDMessaging,XDMessagingClient,D:\newReposJune17\TheCodeKing_XDMessaging.Net\src\XDMessaging.Lite\XDMessagingClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
