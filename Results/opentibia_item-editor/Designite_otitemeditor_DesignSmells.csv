Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: loadClient
Duplicate Abstraction,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  otitemeditor (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs' [72' 96])' otitemeditor (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs' [102' 126])
Feature Envy,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: createItem which is more interested in members of the type: OtbList
Unnecessary Abstraction,Types,Plugin,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\PluginServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance' AssemblyPath' myInstance' myAssemblyPath
Unnecessary Abstraction,otitemeditor.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: currentPlugin' currentOtbVersion' previousPlugin
Deficient Encapsulation,otitemeditor,UpdateForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\UpdateForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: mainForm' selectedPlugin' updateClient' lblDescription
Deficient Encapsulation,otitemeditor,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: plugins
Deficient Encapsulation,otitemeditor,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: plugins
Deficient Encapsulation,otitemeditor,ProgressForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\ProgressForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: bar' progressLbl
Deficient Encapsulation,otitemeditor,UpdateSettingsForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\UpdateSettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: createNewItemsCheck' reloadItemAttributesCheck' generateSignatureCheck' reassignUnmatchedSpritesCheck
Insufficient Modularization,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 146
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: otitemeditor.otitemeditor' otitemeditor.UpdateForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,otitemeditor,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: otitemeditor.Program' otitemeditor.otitemeditor
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,otitemeditor,otitemeditor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\opentibia_item-editor\Source\otitemeditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: otitemeditor.otitemeditor' otitemeditor.Program' otitemeditor.UpdateForm
