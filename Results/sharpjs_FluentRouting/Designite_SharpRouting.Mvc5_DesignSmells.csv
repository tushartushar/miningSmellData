Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpRouting,ConstraintExtensions,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\ConstraintExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SharpRouting,RouteScope,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\RouteScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Configure
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpRouting,TypeExtensions,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpRouting,Require,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\Require.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Require' RouteScope
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpRouting,RouteBuilder,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\RouteBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RouteBuilder' UrlRouteBuilder
Cyclic Hierarchy,SharpRouting,RouteBuilder,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\RouteBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: UrlRouteBuilder
Cyclic Hierarchy,SharpRouting,RouteBuilder,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\RouteBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ParameterRouteBuilder
Broken Hierarchy,SharpRouting,RouteBuilder,C:\repos\sharpjs_FluentRouting\SharpRouting.Mvc5\..\SharpRouting\RouteBuilder.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RouteScope' IRouteBuilder
