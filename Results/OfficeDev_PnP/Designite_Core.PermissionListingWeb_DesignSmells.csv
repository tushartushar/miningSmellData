Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Core.PermissionListingWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.PermissionListing\Core.PermissionListingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Core.PermissionListingWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.PermissionListing\Core.PermissionListingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Core.PermissionListingWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.PermissionListing\Core.PermissionListingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Core.PermissionListingWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.PermissionListing\Core.PermissionListingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
