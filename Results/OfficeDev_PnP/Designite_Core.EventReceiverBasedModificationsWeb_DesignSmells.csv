Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.EventReceiversBasedModifications\Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.EventReceiversBasedModifications\Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Contoso.Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb.Services,AppEventReceiver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.EventReceiversBasedModifications\Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb\Services\AppEventReceiver.svc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.EventReceiversBasedModifications\Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.EventReceiversBasedModifications\Core.EventReceiverBasedModificationsWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
