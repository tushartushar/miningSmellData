Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid.SiteManager,ISiteManagerChannel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\Service References\SiteManager\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid.SharePointContextProvider' Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Provisioning.Hybrid\Provisioning.Hybrid.Console\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Contoso.Provisioning.Hybrid.SharePointContextProvider
