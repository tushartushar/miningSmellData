Imperative Abstraction,SupportTickets.React,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,SupportTickets.React,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,SupportTickets.React,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SupportTickets.React,Utilities,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: serverRelativeUrl
Deficient Encapsulation,SupportTickets.React,Utilities,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: serverRelativeUrl
Insufficient Modularization,SupportTickets.React,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SupportTickets.React,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Hierarchy,SupportTickets.React,SharePointAcsContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SupportTickets.React.SharePointContext
Broken Hierarchy,SupportTickets.React,SharePointHighTrustContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\SharePoint.React.SupportTicket\deploy\SupportTickets.React\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SupportTickets.React.SharePointContext
