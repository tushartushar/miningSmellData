Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,ExternalShare,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\ExternalShare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TokenHelper (C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs' [219' 240])' TokenHelper (C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs' [265' 286])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,JsonMetadataDocument,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: serviceName' endpoints' keys
Unnecessary Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,JsonEndpoint,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,JsonKeyValue,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,JsonKey,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,ExternalShare,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\ExternalShare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' UniqueIdentifier' SiteCollectionUrl' LoginName' InvitedBy' OriginalSharedDate' RefreshSharedDate' LastProcessedDate' UserId
Broken Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,ExternalShareDetails,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AcceptedAs' DisplayName' InvitedAs' InvitedBy' UserId' WhenCreated
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer,ExternalSharingDataEntities,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\ExternalSharingDataModel.Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnModelCreating
