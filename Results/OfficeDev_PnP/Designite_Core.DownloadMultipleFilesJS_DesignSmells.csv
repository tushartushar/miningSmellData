Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Insufficient Modularization,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointContextProvider' Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,SharePointAcsContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointAcsContextProvider' Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointContextProvider' Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\Core.DownloadMultipleFilesJS\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointAcsContextProvider
