Unutilized Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,Global,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,Default,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\Pages\Default.aspx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TokenHelper (C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs' [207' 228])' TokenHelper (C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs' [253' 274])
Unnecessary Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,JsonMetadataDocument,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: serviceName' endpoints' keys
Unnecessary Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,JsonEndpoint,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,JsonKeyValue,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,JsonKey,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Hierarchy,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,SharePointAcsContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb.SharePointContext
Broken Hierarchy,OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb,SharePointHighTrustContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\OD4B.NavLinksInjection\OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OD4B.NavLinksInjectionWeb.SharePointContext
