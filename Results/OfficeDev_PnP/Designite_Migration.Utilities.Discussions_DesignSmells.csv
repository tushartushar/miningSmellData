Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SP_Discussion_Migrator,ProgressInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\DetailsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TotalItems' Completed' TotalItems' Completed' Failed
Unnecessary Abstraction,SP_Discussion_Migrator,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' fetchedFields' nullableFields
Duplicate Abstraction,SP_Discussion_Migrator,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SP_Discussion_Migrator.Settings' SP_Discussion_Migrator.Properties.Settings
Unutilized Abstraction,SP_Discussion_Migrator,StartupForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\StartupForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SP_Discussion_Migrator.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,SP_Discussion_Migrator,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: fetchedFields' nullableFields
Broken Modularization,SP_Discussion_Migrator,ProgressInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\DetailsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TotalItems' Completed' TotalItems' Completed' Failed
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SP_Discussion_Migrator,ConnectionForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\ConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SP_Discussion_Migrator.ConnectionForm' SP_Discussion_Migrator.Program
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SP_Discussion_Migrator,ConnectionForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\ConnectionForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SP_Discussion_Migrator.ConnectionForm' SP_Discussion_Migrator.Program' SP_Discussion_Migrator.DetailsForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SP_Discussion_Migrator,MigrateForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Migration.Utilities.Discussions\Migration.Utilities.Dsicussions\MigrateForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SP_Discussion_Migrator.MigrateForm' SP_Discussion_Migrator.ConnectionForm' SP_Discussion_Migrator.Program
