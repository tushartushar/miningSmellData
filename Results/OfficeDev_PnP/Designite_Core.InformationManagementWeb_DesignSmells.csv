List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TokenHelper (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs' [207' 228])' TokenHelper (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs' [253' 274])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,JsonMetadataDocument,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: serviceName' endpoints' keys
Unnecessary Abstraction,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,JsonEndpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,JsonKeyValue,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,JsonKey,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,SharePointAcsContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider' Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Contoso.Core.InformationManagementWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.InformationManagement\Core.InformationManagementWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointAcsContextProvider
