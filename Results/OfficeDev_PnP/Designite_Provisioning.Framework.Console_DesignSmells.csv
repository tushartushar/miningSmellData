Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Provisioning.Framework,JsonKeyValue,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Provisioning.Framework,JsonKey,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Provisioning.Framework,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Provisioning.Framework,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Insufficient Modularization,Provisioning.Framework,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Provisioning.Framework,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Provisioning.Framework,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Provisioning.Framework.SharePointContextProvider' Provisioning.Framework.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Provisioning.Framework,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Provisioning.Framework.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Provisioning.Framework.SharePointContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Provisioning.Framework,SharePointAcsContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Provisioning.Framework.SharePointAcsContextProvider' Provisioning.Framework.SharePointContextProvider' Provisioning.Framework.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Provisioning.Framework,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.Framework.Console\Provisioning.Framework.Console\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointAcsContextProvider
