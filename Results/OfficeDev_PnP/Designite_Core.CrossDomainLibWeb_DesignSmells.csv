Following fields and properties are declared in this class: serviceName' endpoints' keys
Unnecessary Abstraction,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,JsonEndpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,JsonKeyValue,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,JsonKey,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Core.CrossDomainLib.Controllers,HomeController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\Controllers\HomeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,SharePointAcsContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider' Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Core.CrossDomainLibWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Core.CrossDomainLibWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.CrossDomainLib\Core.CrossDomainLibWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointAcsContextProvider
