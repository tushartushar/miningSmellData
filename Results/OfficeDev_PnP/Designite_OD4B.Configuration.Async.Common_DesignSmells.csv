Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,JsonKeyValue,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,JsonKey,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,SiteModificationConfig,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\SiteModificationConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SiteUrl' JSFile' ThemeName' ThemeColorFile' ThemeFontFile' ThemeBGFile
Insufficient Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.Async.Common\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
