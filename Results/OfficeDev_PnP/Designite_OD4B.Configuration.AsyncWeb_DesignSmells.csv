Imperative Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb.Pages,Customizer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\Pages\Customizer.aspx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb.SharePointContextProvider' OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\OD4B.Configuration.Async\OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' OD4B.Configuration.AsyncWeb.SharePointContextProvider
