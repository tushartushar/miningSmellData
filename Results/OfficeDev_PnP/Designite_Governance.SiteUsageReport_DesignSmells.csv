Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Governance.SiteUsageReport,JsonKeyValue,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Governance.SiteUsageReport,JsonKey,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Governance.SiteUsageReport,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Governance.SiteUsageReport,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Governance.SiteUsageReport,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.SiteUsageReport,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.SiteUsageReport,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.SiteUsageReport\Governance.SiteUsageReport\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
