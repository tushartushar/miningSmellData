(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web.Controllers,ExternalSharesController,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web.Controllers,ExternalSharesController,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ExternalSharesController (C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs' [43' 62])' ExternalSharesController (C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs' [72' 91])
Broken Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,ExternalShare,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\ExternalShare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' UniqueIdentifier' SiteCollectionUrl' LoginName' InvitedBy' OriginalSharedDate' RefreshSharedDate' LastProcessedDate' UserId
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,ExternalSharingDataEntities,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\ExternalSharingDataModel.Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnModelCreating
