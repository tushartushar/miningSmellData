Imperative Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web.Controllers,ExternalSharesController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web.Controllers,ExternalSharesController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ExternalSharesController (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs' [43' 62])' ExternalSharesController (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs' [72' 91])
Feature Envy,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web.Controllers,ExternalSharesController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Extend which is more interested in members of the type: ExternalSharingDataEntities
Feature Envy,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web.Controllers,ExternalSharesController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\Controllers\ExternalSharesController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Revoke which is more interested in members of the type: ExternalSharingDataEntities
Broken Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,ExternalShare,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\ExternalShare.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' UniqueIdentifier' SiteCollectionUrl' LoginName' InvitedBy' OriginalSharedDate' RefreshSharedDate' LastProcessedDate' UserId
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web,ExternalSharingDataEntities,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Solutions\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer\Governance.ExternalSharingTimer.Web\ExternalSharingDataModel.Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnModelCreating
