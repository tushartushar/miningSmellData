Unnecessary Abstraction,Core.FileUploadWeb,JsonEndpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Core.FileUploadWeb,JsonKeyValue,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Core.FileUploadWeb,JsonKey,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Core.FileUploadWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Core.FileUploadWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Insufficient Modularization,Core.FileUploadWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Core.FileUploadWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.FileUploadWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.FileUploadWeb,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Core.FileUploadWeb,SharePointAcsContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider' Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Core.FileUploadWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Core.FileUploadWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Core.FileUpload\Core.FileUploadWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointAcsContextProvider
