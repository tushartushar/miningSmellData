Imperative Abstraction,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,WorkflowTemplateInfo,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\WorkflowTemplateInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PackageFilePath' PackageGuid' PackageName' FeatureId
Insufficient Modularization,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Hierarchy,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,SharePointAcsContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate.SharePointContext
Broken Hierarchy,Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate,SharePointHighTrustContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Provisioning.WorkflowTemplate.SharePointContext
