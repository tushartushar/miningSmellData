Unutilized Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,MvcApplication,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TokenHelper (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs' [207' 228])' TokenHelper (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs' [253' 274])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,JsonMetadataDocument,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: serviceName' endpoints' keys
Unnecessary Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,JsonEndpoint,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: location' protocol' usage
Unnecessary Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,JsonKeyValue,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: type' value
Unnecessary Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,JsonKey,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.Controllers,HomeController,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\Controllers\HomeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,TokenHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,SharePointHighTrustContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider' Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointContextProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,SharePointAcsContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointAcsContextProvider' Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointContextProvider' Diagnostics.LoggingWeb.SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointAcsContextProvider
Cyclic Hierarchy,Diagnostics.LoggingWeb,SharePointContextProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Samples\Diagnostics.Logging\Diagnostics.LoggingWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: SharePointHighTrustContextProvider
