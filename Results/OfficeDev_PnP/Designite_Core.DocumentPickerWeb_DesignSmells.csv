Following fields and properties are declared in this class: usage' keyValue
Imperative Abstraction,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,SharePointContextToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Imperative Abstraction,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MatchesKeyIdentifierClause
Unutilized Abstraction,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,MultipleSymmetricKeySecurityToken,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,TokenHelper,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\TokenHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Broken Hierarchy,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,SharePointAcsContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Core.DocumentPickerWeb.SharePointContext
Broken Hierarchy,Core.DocumentPickerWeb,SharePointHighTrustContext,C:\repos\OfficeDev_PnP\Components\Core.DocumentPicker\Core.DocumentPickerWeb\SharePointContext.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Core.DocumentPickerWeb.SharePointContext
