Unutilized Abstraction,AutofacContrib.NSubstitute.Tests,AutoSubstituteCollectionFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MRCollective_AutofacContrib.NSubstitute\AutofacContrib.NSubstitute.Tests\AutoSubstituteCollectionFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutofacContrib.NSubstitute.Tests,IServiceItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MRCollective_AutofacContrib.NSubstitute\AutofacContrib.NSubstitute.Tests\AutoSubstituteCollectionFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
