Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.8  All the dependencies among components: from: Metrics.SampleReporter' to: Metrics.Reporters' from: Metrics.SampleReporter' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.SampleReporter' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Samples' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.Samples' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.SamplesConsole' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.SamplesConsole' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.SamplesConsole' to: Metrics.Samples' from: Metrics.StupidBenchmarks' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.StupidBenchmarks' to: Metrics.Utils' from: NancyFx.Sample' to: Metrics.Utils' from: NancyFx.Sample' to: Metrics.Samples' from: NancyFx.Sample' to: Metrics' from: Owin.Sample' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Owin.Sample' to: Metrics.Samples' from: Owin.Sample' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.NLog' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.NLog' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.NLog' to: Metrics.Logging' from: Metrics.NLog' to: Metrics.Reporters' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Reports' from: Nancy.Metrics' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Nancy.Metrics' to: Metrics' from: Nancy.Metrics' to: Metrics.Visualization' from: Nancy.Metrics' to: Metrics.Reporters' from: Nancy.Metrics' to: Metrics.Json' from: Nancy.Metrics' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics' to: Nancy.Metrics' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Metrics' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Owin.Metrics' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Metrics.Visualization' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Metrics.Json' from: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' to: Metrics.Reporters' from: Owin.Metrics' to: Metrics' from: Owin.Metrics' to: Owin.Metrics.Middleware' from: Metrics.Central' to: Metrics' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Sampling' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Core' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.ElasticSearch' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Graphite' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Influxdb' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Json' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.Visualization' from: Metrics' to: Metrics.PerfCounters' from: Metrics.Logging' to: Metrics.Logging.LogProviders' from: Metrics.Logging.LogProviders' to: Metrics.Logging' from: Metrics.Core' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Core' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Core' to: Metrics.Sampling' from: Metrics.Core' to: Metrics.PerfCounters' from: Metrics.Core' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.ElasticSearch' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.ElasticSearch' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.ElasticSearch' to: Metrics.Json' from: Metrics.ElasticSearch' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Graphite' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Graphite' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.Graphite' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Influxdb' to: Metrics.Json' from: Metrics.Influxdb' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Influxdb' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Json' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Json' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.Json' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.MetricData' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.MetricData' to: Metrics.Sampling' from: Metrics.RemoteMetrics' to: Metrics.Json' from: Metrics.RemoteMetrics' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.RemoteMetrics' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.RemoteMetrics' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Reporters' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Reporters' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Reporters' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.Sampling' to: Metrics.Utils' from: Metrics.PerfCounters' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Reports' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Reports' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Reports' to: Metrics.Reporters' from: Metrics.Utils' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Utils' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Visualization' to: Metrics.MetricData' from: Metrics.Visualization' to: Metrics' from: Metrics.Visualization' to: Metrics.Json' from: Metrics.Visualization' to: Metrics.Reporters.
