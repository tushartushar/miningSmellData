Feature Envy,Nancy.Metrics,MetricsModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\etishor_Metrics.NET\Src\Adapters\Nancy.Metrics\MetricsModule.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MetricsModule which is more interested in members of the type: ModuleConfig
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Metrics,NancyModuleMetricExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\etishor_Metrics.NET\Src\Adapters\Nancy.Metrics\NancyModuleMetricExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
