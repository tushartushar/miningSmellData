Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ActorRefProvidersConfigSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ActorRefProvidersConfigSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ClusterDomainEventSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ClusterDomainEventSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Feature Envy,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ClusterSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ClusterSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: A_cluster_must_publish_initial_state_as_snapshot_to_subscribers which is more interested in members of the type: Cluster

Insufficient Modularization,Akka.Cluster.Tests,ClusterSpec,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Cluster.Tests\ClusterSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
