Unnecessary Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,StreamTestKit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\StreamTestKit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,GraphStageMessages,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestGraphStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,TestSinkStage<T;TMat>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestGraphStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,TestSourceStage<T;TMat>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestGraphStage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,TestPublisher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TestPublisher (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs' [132' 161])' TestSubscriber (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSubscriber.cs' [409' 438])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,IPublisherEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,ManualProbe<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ExpectNext which is more interested in members of the type: TestProbe
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,TestSink,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,TestSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,ISubscriberEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSubscriber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Streams.TestKit,TestUtils,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Akka.Streams.TestKit,PublisherProbeSubscription<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\StreamTestKit.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: CancelSubscription' RequestMore (in method "ExpectCancellation" of class "PublisherProbeSubscription<T>").
Insufficient Modularization,Akka.Streams.TestKit,ManualProbe<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 47 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Akka.Streams.TestKit,ManualProbe<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Akka.Streams.TestKit,StreamTestKit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\StreamTestKit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Akka.Streams.TestKit.StreamTestKit' Akka.Streams.TestKit.TestPublisher
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,LazyEmptyPublisher<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,LazyErrorPublisher<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestPublisher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,OnSubscribe,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSubscriber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,OnNext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSubscriber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,OnComplete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSubscriber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Streams.TestKit,OnError,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Streams.TestKit\TestSubscriber.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
