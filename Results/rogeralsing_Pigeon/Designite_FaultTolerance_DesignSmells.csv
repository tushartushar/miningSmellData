Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,FaultTolerance,CounterService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\examples\FaultTolerance\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ForwardOrPlaceInBacklog
Missing Hierarchy,FaultTolerance,CounterService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\examples\FaultTolerance\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Increment' Terminated (in method "OnReceive" of class "CounterService").
Missing Hierarchy,FaultTolerance,Counter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\examples\FaultTolerance\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: UseStorage' Increment (in method "OnReceive" of class "Counter").
Missing Hierarchy,FaultTolerance,Storage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\examples\FaultTolerance\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Store' Get (in method "OnReceive" of class "Storage").
