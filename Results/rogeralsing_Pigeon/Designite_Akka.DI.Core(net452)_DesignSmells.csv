Duplicate Abstraction,Akka.DI.Core,DIActorContextAdapter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\contrib\dependencyinjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIActorContextAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DIActorContextAdapter (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\contrib\dependencyinjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIActorContextAdapter.cs' [50' 73])' DIActorSystemAdapter (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\contrib\dependencyinjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIActorSystemAdapter.cs' [38' 61])
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.DI.Core,Extensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\contrib\dependencyinjection\Akka.DI.Core\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Akka.DI.Core,DIExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\contrib\dependencyinjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DIExtensionProvider
Deficient Encapsulation,Akka.DI.Core,DIExtension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\contrib\dependencyinjection\Akka.DI.Core\DIExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DIExtensionProvider
