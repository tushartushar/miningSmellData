Missing Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,AsyncWriteProxy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\AsyncWriteProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: InitTimeout' SetStore (in method "AroundReceive" of class "AsyncWriteProxy").
Missing Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,ReplayMediator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\AsyncWriteProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IPersistentRepresentation' ReplaySuccess' ReceiveTimeout (in method "Receive" of class "ReplayMediator").
Wide Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,IEventAdapter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\EventAdapters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Akka.Persistence.Journal.IdentityEventAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Journal.NoopWriteEventAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Journal.NoopReadEventAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Journal.CombinedReadEventAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.AEndToEndAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.NewAEndToEndAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.BEndToEndAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.NewBEndToEndAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.UserAgeTaggingAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.LoggingAdapter' Akka.Persistence.Tests.Journal.BaseTestAdapter
Cyclic Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,IReadEventAdapter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\EventAdapters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: IEventAdapter
Missing Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,PersistencePluginProxy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\PersistencePluginProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TargetLocation' InitTimeout (in method "Init" of class "PersistencePluginProxy").
Missing Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,PersistencePluginProxy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\PersistencePluginProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ActorIdentity' Terminated (in method "Identifying" of class "PersistencePluginProxy").
Missing Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,PersistencePluginProxy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\PersistencePluginProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TargetLocation' Terminated (in method "Active" of class "PersistencePluginProxy").
Missing Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,PersistencePluginProxy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\PersistencePluginProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IJournalRequest' AtomicWrite' TargetLocation (in method "InitTimedOut" of class "PersistencePluginProxy").
Broken Hierarchy,Akka.Persistence.Journal,WriteJournalBase,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\core\Akka.Persistence\Journal\WriteJournal.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Akka.Actor.ActorBase
