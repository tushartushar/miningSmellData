Missing Hierarchy,PersistenceExample,AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor,C:\repos\rogeralsing_Pigeon\src\examples\PersistenceExample\AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Message' Confirmation (in method "ReceiveRecover" of class "AtLeastOnceDeliveryExampleActor").
