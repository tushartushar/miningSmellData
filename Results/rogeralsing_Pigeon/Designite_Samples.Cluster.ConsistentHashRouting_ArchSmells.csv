Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Ambiguous Interface,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: StartCommand,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting.StartCommand
Feature Concentration,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BackendActor' FrontendCommand]' [FrontendActor' StartCommand' CommandComplete]' [Program]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting.BackendActor' Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting.FrontendCommand' Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting.Program
