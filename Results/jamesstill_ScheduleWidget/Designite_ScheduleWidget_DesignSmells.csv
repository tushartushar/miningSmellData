Unutilized Abstraction,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,WeekInRange,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\WeekInRange.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,Schedule,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\Schedule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Event
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,Schedule,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\Schedule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Event' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.EventFrequencyBuilder
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,Event,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Event' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,Event,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Event' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.EventFrequencyBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder,EventFrequencyBuilder,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\FrequencyBuilder\EventFrequencyBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.EventFrequencyBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Event
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder,EventFrequencyBuilder,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduledEvents\FrequencyBuilder\EventFrequencyBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.EventFrequencyBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Event
Broken Hierarchy,ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions,CollectionTE,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\CollectionTE.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.TemporalExpression
Broken Hierarchy,ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions,AnniversaryTE,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\AnniversaryTE.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.YearTE
Unfactored Hierarchy,ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions,DayInWeekTE,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\DayInWeekTE.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DayInWeekTE (C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\DayInWeekTE.cs' [52' 79])' DayOfWeekTE (C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\DayOfWeekTE.cs' [38' 65])
Cyclic Hierarchy,ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions,MonthTE,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\MonthTE.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DayInMonthTE
Wide Hierarchy,ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions,TemporalExpression,C:\repos\jamesstill_ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\ScheduleWidget\TemporalExpressions\TemporalExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.CollectionTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.DayInQuarterTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.DayIntervalTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.DayInWeekTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.DayOfWeekTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.DateTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.DifferenceTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.FixedHolidayTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.MonthTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.RangeEachYearTE' ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.YearTE
