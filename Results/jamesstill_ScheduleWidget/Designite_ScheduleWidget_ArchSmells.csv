Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,ScheduleWidget,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.DayOfWeekEnumComparer' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Schedule' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.EventFrequencyBuilder
Unstable Dependency,ScheduleWidget,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.IEventFrequencyBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.EventFrequencyBuilder
Feature Concentration,ScheduleWidget,ScheduleWidget.Enums,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [EnumExtensions' DayOfWeekEnum]' [FrequencyTypeEnum]' [MonthlyIntervalEnum]' [QuarterEnum]' [QuarterlyIntervalEnum]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.83,ScheduleWidget.Enums.FrequencyTypeEnum' ScheduleWidget.Enums.MonthlyIntervalEnum' ScheduleWidget.Enums.QuarterEnum' ScheduleWidget.Enums.QuarterlyIntervalEnum
Feature Concentration,ScheduleWidget,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Anniversary' Event' DateRange' ISchedule' Schedule' RangeInYear]' [DayOfWeekEnumComparer]' [Utilities]' [WeekInRange]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.DayOfWeekEnumComparer' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.Utilities' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.WeekInRange
Feature Concentration,ScheduleWidget,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DailyEventBuilder]' [OneTimeEventBuilder]' [MonthlyEventBuilder]' [QuarterlyEventBuilder]' [WeeklyEventBuilder]' [DailyEventWithFirstDateTimeBuilder]' [YearlyEventBuilder]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders.OneTimeEventBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders.MonthlyEventBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders.QuarterlyEventBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders.WeeklyEventBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders.DailyEventWithFirstDateTimeBuilder' ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders.YearlyEventBuilder
Scattered Functionality,ScheduleWidget,ScheduleWidget.ScheduledEvents.FrequencyBuilder.ConcreteBuilders,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions' ScheduleWidget.Enums,ScheduleWidget.TemporalExpressions.CollectionTE' ScheduleWidget.Enums.EnumExtensions
