Unnecessary Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests,IConventionData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\IConventionData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Description' HasData
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests,Convention,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\Convention.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests.ConventionData,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\ConventionData\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests.ConventionData,ProjectFileItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\ConventionData\ProjectFileItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FilePath' ReferenceType
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests.ConventionData,ProjectReference,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\ConventionData\ProjectReference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ReferencedPath
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests.Internal,LinqExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\Internal\LinqExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests.Internal,PredicateHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\Internal\PredicateHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestStack.ConventionTests.Internal,ReflectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\Internal\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TestStack.ConventionTests.Internal,IConventionFormatContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\Internal\IConventionFormatContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TestStack.ConventionTests.Internal.IConventionFormatContext' TestStack.ConventionTests.Reporting.ITestResultProcessor
Wide Hierarchy,TestStack.ConventionTests,IConvention,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\TestStack_ConventionTests\TestStack.ConventionTests\IConvention.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.ConfigurationHasSpecificValue' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.ViewModelShouldInheritFromINotifyPropertyChanged' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.MvcControllerNameAndBaseClassConvention' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.ClassTypeHasSpecificNamespace' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.AllMethodsAreVirtual' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.AllClassesHaveDefaultConstructor' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.FilesAreEmbeddedResources' TestStack.ConventionTests.Conventions.ProjectDoesNotReferenceDllsFromBinOrObjDirectories' TestStack.ConventionTests.Autofac.CanResolveAllRegisteredServices' TestStack.ConventionTests.Autofac.ServicesShouldOnlyHaveDependenciesWithLesserLifetime' TestStack.ConventionTests.Tests.CustomConventionWhichDoesNothing' TestStack.ConventionTests.Tests.TestConventions.CollectionsRelationsConvention
