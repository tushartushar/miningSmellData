Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,TypeNameFormatter,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\TypeHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TypeNameFormatter' TypeHelper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,UnitSetNamespace,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\UnitHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: UnitSetNamespace' NestedUnitSetNamespace
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,MetadataReaderHost,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\Core.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResolvingModuleReference
Multipath Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,SpecializedFieldDefinition,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\Members.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ISpecializedFieldReference
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,Matrix,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\Types.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ArrayType
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,ModifiedPointerType,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\Types.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PointerType' IModifiedTypeReference
Multipath Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,SpecializedNestedTypeDefinition,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ISpecializedNestedTypeReference
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,AggregatedScope,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\UnitHelper.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Scope
Cyclic Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,UnitSetNamespace,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\UnitHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: NestedUnitSetNamespace
Multipath Hierarchy,Microsoft.Cci,NestedUnitSetNamespace,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\MetadataHelper\UnitHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: INamespaceMember
