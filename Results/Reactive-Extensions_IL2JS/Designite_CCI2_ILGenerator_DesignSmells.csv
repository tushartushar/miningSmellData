Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Cci,ILGenerator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\CCI2\ILGenerator\ILGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 122
