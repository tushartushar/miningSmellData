Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Net.Browser,WebRequestCreator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\WebRequestCreator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BrowserHttp' ClientHttp
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.Browser,WebRequestCreator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\WebRequestCreator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.Browser,ClientHttpWebRequestCreator,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\WebRequestCreator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,System.Net.Browser,ClientHttpWebRequest,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\ClientHttpWebRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.84
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,DispatcherOperation,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\DispatcherOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,DispatcherOperation,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\DispatcherOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,DispatcherTimer,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\DispatcherTimer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,Dispatcher,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\\Dispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Net.Browser,ClientHttpWebResponse,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\ClientHttpWebResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Close
Broken Hierarchy,System.Net.Interop,AsyncResult,C:\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\Interop\AsyncResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AsyncResultNoResult
