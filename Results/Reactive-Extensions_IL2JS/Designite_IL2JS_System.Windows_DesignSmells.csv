Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Net.Browser,WebRequestCreator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\WebRequestCreator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BrowserHttp' ClientHttp
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.Browser,WebRequestCreator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\WebRequestCreator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,System.Net.Browser,ClientHttpWebRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\ClientHttpWebRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnStateChanged which is more interested in members of the type: XmlHttpRequest
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,DispatcherOperation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\DispatcherOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,DispatcherTimer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\DispatcherTimer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Windows.Threading,Dispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Windows\Threading\Dispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Net.Browser,ClientHttpWebResponse,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\ClientHttpWebResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Close
Broken Hierarchy,System.Net.Interop,AsyncResult<TResult>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_IL2JS\System.Windows\System\Net\Browser\Interop\AsyncResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Net.Interop.AsyncResultNoResult
