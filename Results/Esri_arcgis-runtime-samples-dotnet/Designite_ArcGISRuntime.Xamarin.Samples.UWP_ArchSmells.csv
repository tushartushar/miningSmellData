The participating components in the cycle are: ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Managers' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Managers.SampleManager' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.SampleModel
Unstable Dependency,ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.UWP,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Managers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Managers.SampleStructureMap' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Managers.Logger' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Managers.SampleModel
Unstable Dependency,ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.UWP,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ArcGISRuntimeXamarin,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.Logger
Ambiguous Interface,ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.UWP,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: SampleModelExtensions,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.SampleModelExtensions
Feature Concentration,ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.UWP,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CategoryModel]' [FeaturedModel]' [Reason]' [SampleModel' SampleModelExtensions' SampleStructureMap]' [SampleType]' [SubCategoryModel]' [SampleInfo]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.78,ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.CategoryModel' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.FeaturedModel' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.Reason' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.SampleType' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.SubCategoryModel' ArcGISRuntimeXamarin.Models.SampleInfo
