Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Samples.CSharp,ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Managers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Managers' ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models,ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Managers.ApplicationManager' ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models.SampleModel
Feature Concentration,ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Samples.CSharp,ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CategoryModel]' [FeaturedModel]' [Reason]' [Language' SampleModel' SampleModelExtensions' SampleStructureMap' SampleType]' [SubCategoryModel]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.56,ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models.CategoryModel' ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models.FeaturedModel' ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models.Reason' ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Models.SubCategoryModel
