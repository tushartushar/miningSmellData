Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,DD4TModelBuilder,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\DD4TModelBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Create
Unutilized Abstraction,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,ExtensionlessLinkFactory,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\ExtensionlessLinkFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,PublicationResolver,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\PublicationResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Statics,BinaryDistributionModule,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Statics\BinaryDistributionModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Statics,Dimensions,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Statics\BinaryFileManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Width' Height' NoStretch
Unutilized Abstraction,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Utils,ObjectExtension,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Utils\ObjectExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,DD4TModelBuilder,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\DD4TModelBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,DD4TModelBuilder,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\DD4TModelBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 139
Broken Modularization,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,MappingData,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\MappingData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TargetType' Content' Meta' TargetEntitiesByPrefix' SemanticSchema' EntityNames' ParentDefaultPrefix' EmbedLevel' SourceEntity
Missing Hierarchy,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,DD4TModelBuilder,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\DD4TModelBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IEntity' MediaItem (in method "CreateEntity" of class "DD4TModelBuilder").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Sdl.Web.DD4T.Mapping,DD4TContentProvider,C:\repos\bkoopman_tri\web-application\Sdl.Web.DD4T\Mapping\DD4TContentProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetEntityModel' GetEntityContent
