Unnecessary Abstraction,Monoscape.LoadBalancerController,RequestQueue,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.LoadBalancerController\RequestQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
