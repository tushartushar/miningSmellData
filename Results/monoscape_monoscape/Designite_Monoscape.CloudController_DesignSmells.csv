Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController,ControllerMain,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\ControllerMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ControllerMain[1' 20]' ControllerService[1' 20]' Settings[1' 20]' ApplicationService[1' 20]' CcDashboardService[1' 20]' ExternalSystemService[1' 20]' FileReceiveSocket[1' 20]
Duplicate Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController,ControllerMain,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\ControllerMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ControllerMain[1' 23]' Settings[1' 23]' ApplicationService[1' 23]' CcDashboardService[1' 23]' ExternalSystemService[1' 23]' FileReceiveSocket[1' 23]
Duplicate Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController.PersistenceStorage,PersistentDataContext,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\PersistentStorage\PersistentDataContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PersistentDataContext[224' 248]' PersistentDataContext[421' 445]
Duplicate Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController.PersistenceStorage,PersistentDataContext,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\PersistentStorage\PersistentDataContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PersistentDataContext[327' 351]' PersistentDataContext[498' 522]
Multifaceted Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController.PersistenceStorage,Subscription,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\PersistentStorage\PersistentDataContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Unnecessary Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController.Runtime,Settings,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\Runtime\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SQLiteConnectionString' DashboardServiceURL' ApplicationServiceURL' ExternalSystemServiceURL
Unutilized Abstraction,Monoscape.CloudController.Sockets,FileReceiveSocket,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\Sockets\FileReceiveSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Monoscape.CloudController.PersistenceStorage,Subscription,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\PersistentStorage\PersistentDataContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Subscription' SubscriptionItem
Broken Hierarchy,Monoscape.CloudController.Sockets,FileReceiveSocket,C:\repos\monoscape_monoscape\Monoscape.CloudController\Sockets\FileReceiveSocket.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractFileReceiveSocket
