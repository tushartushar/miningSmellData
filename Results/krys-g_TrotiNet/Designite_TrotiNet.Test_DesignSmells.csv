Unutilized Abstraction,TrotiNet.Test,TestDecompress,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Test\TestDecompress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TrotiNet.Test,TestHeaders,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Test\TestHeaders.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TrotiNet.Test,TestTCPv4,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Test\TestIo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet.Test,EchoSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Test\EchoSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: socket
Broken Hierarchy,TrotiNet.Test,TcpServerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Test\TcpCommon.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TrotiNet.TcpServer
Broken Hierarchy,TrotiNet.Test,DummyProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Test\TestDecompress.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TrotiNet.ProxyLogic
