Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrotiNet,IoBroken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\Exceptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,TrotiNet,BaseProxyLogic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\ProxyLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LogicLoop
Feature Envy,TrotiNet,ProxyLogic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\ProxyLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetChunkedContent which is more interested in members of the type: HttpSocket
Unutilized Abstraction,TrotiNet,SystemProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION_LIST,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' pszConnection' dwOptionCount' dwOptionError' pOptions
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwOption' Value
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION_UNION,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ft' i' iptr
Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet,SystemProxySettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxySettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ProxyOverride' ProxyServer' AutoConfigURL
Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet,RequestProcessingState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\ProxyLogic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: bPersistConnectionBP' bPersistConnectionPS' bRequestHasMessage' RequestMessageLength' bRequestMessageChunked' bUseDefaultPersistBP' OnResponseMessagePacket' NextStep
Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION_LIST,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwSize' pszConnection' dwOptionCount' dwOptionError' pOptions
Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwOption' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION_UNION,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ft' i' iptr
Deficient Encapsulation,TrotiNet,HttpSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\HttpSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: id
Broken Modularization,TrotiNet,INTERNET_PER_CONN_OPTION_LIST,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\SystemProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' pszConnection' dwOptionCount' dwOptionError' pOptions
Insufficient Modularization,TrotiNet,HttpSocket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\HttpSocket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,TrotiNet,ProxyLogic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\krys-g_TrotiNet\Lib\ProxyLogic.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TrotiNet.BaseProxyLogic
