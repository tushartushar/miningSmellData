Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MaxMind.Db.Test,DecoderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\DecoderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MaxMind.Db.Test,NetworkTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\NetworkTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MaxMind.Db.Test,PointerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\PointerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MaxMind.Db.Test,ReaderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\ReaderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MaxMind.Db.Test,ThreadingTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\ThreadingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MaxMind.Db.Test.Helper,NNInnerMapX,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\Helper\NoNetworkTypeHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NNInnerMapX (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\Helper\NoNetworkTypeHolder.cs' [88' 108])' InnerMapX (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\Helper\TypeHolder.cs' [103' 123])
Insufficient Modularization,MaxMind.Db.Test,ReaderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\ReaderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MaxMind.Db.Test.Helper,NonSeekableStreamWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db.Test\Helper\NonSeekableStreamWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek' SetLength
