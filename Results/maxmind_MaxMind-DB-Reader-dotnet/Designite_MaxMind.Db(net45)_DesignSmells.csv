Unnecessary Abstraction,MaxMind.Db,ConstructorAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\ConstructorAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,MaxMind.Db,Decoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\Decoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Decode
Feature Envy,MaxMind.Db,Decoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\Decoder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CtrlData which is more interested in members of the type: Buffer
Unutilized Abstraction,MaxMind.Db,Reader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\Reader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MaxMind.Db,NetNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\Reader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IPBytes' Bit' Pointer
Rebellious Hierarchy,MaxMind.Db,ArrayBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\ArrayBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReadOne' ReadString' Dispose
Rebellious Hierarchy,MaxMind.Db,MemoryMapBuffer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\maxmind_MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet\MaxMind.Db\MemoryMapBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReadOne
