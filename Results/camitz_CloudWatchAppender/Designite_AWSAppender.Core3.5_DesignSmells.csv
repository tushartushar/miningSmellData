Unutilized Abstraction,AWSAppender.Core.PatternConverter,InstanceIDPatternConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\PatternConverter\InstanceIDPatternConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,AWSAppender.Core.PatternConverter,NamedPatternConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\PatternConverter\NamedPatternConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ActivateOptions
Unnecessary Abstraction,AWSAppender.Core.Services,AppenderValue,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\Services\AppenderValue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' dValue' sValue' Time
Imperative Abstraction,AWSAppender.Core.Services,EventMessageParserBase<TDatum>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\Services\EventMessageParserBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Unutilized Abstraction,AWSAppender.Core.Services,EventProcessorBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\Services\EventProcessorBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AWSAppender.Core.Services,AppenderValue,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\Services\AppenderValue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' dValue' sValue' Time
Deficient Encapsulation,AWSAppender.Core.Services,ServiceTasks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\Services\ServiceTasks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Tasks
Deficient Encapsulation,AWSAppender.Core.Services,ServiceTasks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\Services\ServiceTasks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Tasks
Broken Modularization,AWSAppender.Core,IAWSAppender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\camitz_CloudWatchAppender\AWSAppender.Core\IAWSAppender.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
