Multifaceted Abstraction,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,IkvmLoader,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\lib\NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.IKVM\IkvmLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.98
Insufficient Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,IkvmLoader,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\lib\NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.IKVM\IkvmLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ICSharpCode.NRefactory.TypeSystem,IkvmLoader,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\lib\NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.IKVM\IkvmLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 307
Unfactored Hierarchy,ICSharpCode.NRefactory,StringConstantValue,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\lib\NRefactory\ICSharpCode.NRefactory.IKVM\StringConstantValue.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: StringConstantValue[3' 32]' IntConstantValue[3' 32]' StructConstantValue[3' 32]' ShortConstantValue[3' 32]
