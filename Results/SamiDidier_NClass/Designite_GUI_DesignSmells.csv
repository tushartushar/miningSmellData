Insufficient Modularization,NClass.GUI,MainForm,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\GUI\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 72 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NClass.GUI,MainForm,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\GUI\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Broken Modularization,NClass.GUI,WindowSettings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\GUI\WindowSettings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' WindowPosition' IsWindowMaximized' ClientSplitterDistance' ShowModelExplorer' ShowNavigator' WindowSize' ToolsSplitterDistance' defaultInstance
Rebellious Hierarchy,NClass.GUI.ModelExplorer,ProjectItemNode,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\GUI\ModelExplorer\ProjectItemNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: LabelModified
