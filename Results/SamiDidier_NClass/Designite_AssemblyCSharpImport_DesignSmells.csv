Unnecessary Abstraction,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport,TemplateList,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\ImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport,ImportSettings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\ImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Imperative Abstraction,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport,NETImport,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\NETImport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ImportAssembly
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport,NETImport,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\NETImport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: NETImport[221' 246]' Common[17' 42]
Unnecessary Abstraction,ICSharpCode.NRefactory,Declaration,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\Declaration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport.Lang,Strings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\Lang\Strings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Strings[43' 63]' Resources[43' 63]
Unnecessary Abstraction,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ImportSettingsTemplates' defaultInstance
Missing Hierarchy,NClass.AssemblyCSharpImport,ImportSettingsForm,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\AssemblyCSharpImport\ImportSettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: FilterModifiers' FilterElements (in method "StoreSettings" of class "ImportSettingsForm").
