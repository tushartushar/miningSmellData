Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NClass.CSharpCodeSourceImport,TemplateList,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\ImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,NClass.CSharpCodeSourceImport,ImportSettings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\ImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unnecessary Abstraction,NClass.CSharpCodeSourceImport.Lang,Strings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\Lang\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.CSharpCodeSourceImport.Lang,Strings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\Lang\Strings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: NClass.CSharpCodeSourceImport.Lang.Strings' NClass.CSharpSourceCodeImport.Lang.Strings
Unutilized Abstraction,NClass.CSharpSourceCodeImport.Lang,Strings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\Lang\Strings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NClass.CSharpSourceCodeImport.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ImportSettingsTemplates' defaultInstance
Missing Hierarchy,NClass.CSharpCodeSourceImport,ImportSettingsForm,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CSharpCodeSourceImport\ImportSettingsForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: FilterModifiers' FilterElements (in method "StoreSettings" of class "ImportSettingsForm").
