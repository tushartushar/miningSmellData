Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PDFExport,RegionExtend,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\RegionExtend.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PDFExport.Properties,Resources,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Resources[43' 63]' Strings[43' 63]
Unnecessary Abstraction,PDFExport.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' OnlySelectedElements' Padding' Unit' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,PDFExport,PDFGraphics,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\PDFGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,PDFExport,PDFGraphics,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\PDFGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PDFExport,PDFGraphics,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\PDFGraphics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 132
Broken Modularization,PDFExport.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\PDFExport\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' OnlySelectedElements' Padding' Unit' defaultInstance
