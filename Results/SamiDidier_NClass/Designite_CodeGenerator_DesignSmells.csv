Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,CSharpExtendedGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\CSharpExtendedGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,CSharpFormattingOptionsUI,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\CSharpFormattingOptionsUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CSharpFormattingOptionsUI[1467' 1664]' CSharpFormattingOptionsUI[1670' 1867]
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,FormattingOptionsFactoryUI,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\FormattingOptionsFactoryUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FormattingOptionsFactoryUI[54' 73]' FormattingOptionsFactoryUI[223' 242]
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,FormattingOptionsFactoryUI,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\FormattingOptionsFactoryUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FormattingOptionsFactoryUI[97' 124]' FormattingOptionsFactoryUI[269' 296]
Duplicate Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,VSSolutionGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\VSSolutionGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: VSSolutionGenerator[1' 20]' SolutionGenerator[1' 20]
Imperative Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,Dialog,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\Dialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowDialog
Imperative Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,SourceFileGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\SourceFileGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Generate
Multifaceted Abstraction,NClass.CodeGenerator,SourceFileGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\SourceFileGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unexloited Encapsulation,NClass.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceFileGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceFileGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: CompositeType' EnumType (in method "WriteType" of class "CSharpSourceFileGenerator").
Unexloited Encapsulation,NClass.CodeGenerator,CSharpSourceFileGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\CSharpSourceFileGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Property' Event (in method "WriteOperation" of class "CSharpSourceFileGenerator").
Unexloited Encapsulation,NClass.CodeGenerator,JavaSourceFileGenerator,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\JavaSourceFileGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: CompositeType' EnumType (in method "WriteType" of class "JavaSourceFileGenerator").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NClass.CodeGenerator,CSharpFormattingOptionsUI,C:\repos\SamiDidier_NClass\src\CodeGenerator\CSharpFormattingOptionsUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CSharpFormattingOptionsUI' FormattingOptionsFactoryUI
