Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,LogsearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: LogSearchShipper.Core' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog,LogSearchShipper.Core.LogSearchShipperProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.INxLogProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.NxLogProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.ServiceControllerEx,LogSearchShipper.Core.LogSearchShipperProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.INxLogProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.NxLogProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.ServiceControllerEx
Unstable Dependency,LogsearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): LogSearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.ProcessUtils,LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog.ProcessUtils
Feature Concentration,LogsearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConfigWatcher' LogSearchShipperProcessManager' EDBEnvironment' EDBServerGroup' EdbServer' EDBEnvironmentComparer' EDBFileWatchParser' EdbDataFormatter' EdbService]' [ISO8601DatePatternConverter]' [JSONFragmentPatternConverter]' [ProcessUtils]' [SearchExtensionMethods]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,LogSearchShipper.Core.ISO8601DatePatternConverter' LogSearchShipper.Core.JSONFragmentPatternConverter' LogSearchShipper.Core.ProcessUtils' LogSearchShipper.Core.SearchExtensionMethods,LogSearchShipper.Core.ConfigWatcher' LogSearchShipper.Core.ISO8601DatePatternConverter' LogSearchShipper.Core.JSONFragmentPatternConverter' LogSearchShipper.Core.EdbDataFormatter' LogSearchShipper.Core.ProcessUtils' LogSearchShipper.Core.LogSearchShipperProcessManager' LogSearchShipper.Core.EDBEnvironment' LogSearchShipper.Core.EDBServerGroup' LogSearchShipper.Core.EdbServer' LogSearchShipper.Core.EdbService' LogSearchShipper.Core.EDBEnvironmentComparer' LogSearchShipper.Core.SearchExtensionMethods' LogSearchShipper.Core.EDBFileWatchParser
Feature Concentration,LogsearchShipper.Core,LogSearchShipper.Core.NxLog,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [NativeMethods' ServiceAccessRights' ServiceBootFlag' ServiceError' ServiceControllerEx' ScmAccessRights' INxLogProcessManager' NxLogProcessManager' SyslogEndpoint]' [NxLogStartException].
