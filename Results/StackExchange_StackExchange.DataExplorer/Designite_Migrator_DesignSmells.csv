Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Migrator,ProgramExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertValid which is more interested in members of the type: OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,Option,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.Option' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionContext' NDesk.Options.Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,Option,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.Option' NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\StackExchange_StackExchange.DataExplorer\App\StackExchange.Migrator\lib\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NDesk.Options.OptionValueCollection' NDesk.Options.OptionSet' NDesk.Options.OptionContext' NDesk.Options.Option
