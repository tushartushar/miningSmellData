Unutilized Abstraction,Trinity.Network.Connectivity,PacketReceiverContracts,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Connectivity\IPacketReceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Trinity.Network,NetExtensions,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\NetExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Trinity.Network.Security,ConnectedPermission,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Security\ConnectedPermission.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Trinity.Network.Transmission,IPacket,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Transmission\IPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BaseStream' OpCode' Length' Position

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Trinity.Network.Connectivity.Sockets,TcpClient,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Connectivity\Sockets\TcpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Trinity.Network.Connectivity.Sockets.TcpClient' Trinity.Network.Connectivity.Sockets.TcpServer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Trinity.Network.Connectivity.Sockets,TcpServer,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Connectivity\Sockets\TcpServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Trinity.Network.Connectivity.Sockets.TcpServer' Trinity.Network.Connectivity.Sockets.TcpClient
Rebellious Hierarchy,Trinity.Network.Connectivity,ClientContracts,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Connectivity\IClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Disconnect
Rebellious Hierarchy,Trinity.Network.Connectivity,ServerContracts,C:\repos\Trinity-Encore_Encore\Trinity.Network\Connectivity\IServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Stop
