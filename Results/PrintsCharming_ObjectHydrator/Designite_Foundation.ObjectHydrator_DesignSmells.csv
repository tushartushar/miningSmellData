Deficient Encapsulation,Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators,FromListGetListGenerator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Generators\FromListGetListGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: list
Insufficient Modularization,Foundation.ObjectHydrator,Hydrator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Hydrator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 52 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Foundation.ObjectHydrator,Hydrator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Hydrator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 56 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Foundation.ObjectHydrator,Hydrator<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Hydrator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Hydrator<T>' Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators.TypeGenerator<T>' Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators.ListGenerator<T>
Broken Hierarchy,Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators,UnitedKingdomMobileGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Generators\UnitedKingdomPhoneNumberGenerator.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators.UnitedKingdomPhoneNumberGenerator
Broken Hierarchy,Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators,UnitedKingdomLandlineGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Generators\UnitedKingdomPhoneNumberGenerator.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Generators.UnitedKingdomPhoneNumberGenerator
Wide Hierarchy,Foundation.ObjectHydrator.Interfaces,IGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PrintsCharming_ObjectHydrator\Foundation.ObjectHydrator\Interfaces\IGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large.
