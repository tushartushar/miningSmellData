Unutilized Abstraction,Fixie.TestAdapter,LoggingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fixie_fixie\src\Fixie.TestAdapter\LoggingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixie.TestAdapter,TestAssembly,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fixie_fixie\src\Fixie.TestAdapter\TestAssembly.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Fixie.TestAdapter,VsTestDiscoverer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fixie_fixie\src\Fixie.TestAdapter\VsTestDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Fixie.TestAdapter,ExecutionRecorder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fixie_fixie\src\Fixie.TestAdapter\ExecutionRecorder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Fixie.TestAdapter.ExecutionRecorder' Fixie.TestAdapter.VsTestExecutor
