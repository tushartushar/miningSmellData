Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Threading,LocalDataStore,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Threading.Thread\src\System\Threading\Thread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Threading,ThreadExceptionEventArgs,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Threading.Thread\src\System\Threading\ThreadExceptionEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Threading,Thread,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Threading.Thread\src\System\Threading\Thread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 63 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Threading,Thread,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Threading.Thread\src\System\Threading\Thread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 68 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Threading,Thread,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Threading.Thread\src\System\Threading\Thread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetHashCode
