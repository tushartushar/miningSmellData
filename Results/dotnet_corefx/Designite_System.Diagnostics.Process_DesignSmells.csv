Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Collections.Specialized,StringDictionaryWrapper,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Collections\Specialized\StringDictionaryWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Diagnostics,Process,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\Process.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Diagnostics,ThreadPriorityLevel,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\ThreadPriorityLevel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Diagnostics,MonitoringDescriptionAttribute,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\MonitoringDescriptionAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Diagnostics,Process,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\Process.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Diagnostics,Process,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\Process.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Broken Modularization,System.Diagnostics,ThreadInfo,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\ThreadInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _threadId' _processId' _basePriority' _currentPriority' _startAddress' _threadState' _threadWaitReason
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Collections.Specialized,StringDictionaryWrapper,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Collections\Specialized\StringDictionaryWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clear' ContainsKey' ContainsValue' CopyTo' Remove
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Diagnostics,ProcessModule,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\ProcessModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
Broken Hierarchy,System.Diagnostics,ProcessModuleCollection,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\ProcessModuleCollection.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase
Broken Hierarchy,System.Diagnostics,ProcessThreadCollection,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Diagnostics.Process\src\System\Diagnostics\ProcessThreadCollection.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase
