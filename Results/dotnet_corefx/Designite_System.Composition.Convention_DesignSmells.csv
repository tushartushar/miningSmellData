Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Internal,EmptyArray<T>,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\Microsoft\Internal\EmptyArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Value
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Internal,EmptyArray<T>,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\Microsoft\Internal\EmptyArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Internal,AttributeServices,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\Microsoft\Internal\AttributeServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Internal,ReflectionServices,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\Microsoft\Internal\ReflectionServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Composition.Convention,ConventionBuilder,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\ConventionBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConventionBuilder (C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\ConventionBuilder.cs' [251' 271])' ConventionBuilder (C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\ConventionBuilder.cs' [311' 331])
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Composition.Convention,ParameterImportConventionBuilder,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\ParameterImportConventionBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Composition.Convention,PartConventionBuilder,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\PartConventionBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Composition.Convention,PartConventionBuilder,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\PartConventionBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Broken Hierarchy,System.Composition.Convention,PartConventionBuilder<T>,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Composition.Convention\src\System\Composition\Convention\PartConventionBuilderOfT.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Composition.Convention.PartConventionBuilder
