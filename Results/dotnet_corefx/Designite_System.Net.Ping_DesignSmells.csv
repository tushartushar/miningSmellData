Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.NetworkInformation,Ping,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\Ping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.NetworkInformation,PingException,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\PingException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net,ByteOrder,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\ByteOrder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net,IntPtrHelper,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\IntPtrHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Net,IPAddressParserStatics,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\IPAddressParserStatics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' IPv4AddressBytes' IPv6AddressBytes' IPv6AddressShorts
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Net,Keywords,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\Logging\NetEventSource.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Default' Debug' EnterExit
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net,Keywords,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\Logging\NetEventSource.Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net,InternalException,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\InternalException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.Sockets,IPAddressExtensions,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\Internals\IPAddressExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Net.Sockets,IPEndPointExtensions,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Net\Internals\IPEndPointExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Net.NetworkInformation,Ping,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\Ping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Net.NetworkInformation,Ping,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\Ping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Net,NetEventSource,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\NetEventSource.Ping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Net,NetEventSource,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\NetEventSource.Ping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Broken Hierarchy,System.Net,NetEventSource,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Net.Ping\src\System\Net\NetworkInformation\NetEventSource.Ping.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource
