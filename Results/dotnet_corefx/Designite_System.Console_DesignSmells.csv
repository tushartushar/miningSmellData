Multifaceted Abstraction,System,Console,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\Console.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Unutilized Abstraction,System,ConsoleKeyInfo,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\ConsoleKeyInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO,ConsoleStream,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\IO\ConsoleStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Text,ConsoleEncoding,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Text\ConsoleEncoding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System,Console,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\Console.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 58 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System,Console,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\Console.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 62 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,SyncTextWriter,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\IO\SyncTextWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,SyncTextWriter,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\IO\SyncTextWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Text,ConsoleEncoding,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Text\ConsoleEncoding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.IO,ConsoleStream,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.Console\src\System\IO\ConsoleStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetLength' Seek
