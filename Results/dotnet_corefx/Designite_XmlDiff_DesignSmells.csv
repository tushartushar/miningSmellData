Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiff,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiff.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Xml.XmlDiff,PropertyCollection,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis,ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAssemblyAttribute,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Diagnostics\CodeAnalysis\ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAssemblyAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis,ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAssemblyAttribute,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\Diagnostics\CodeAnalysis\ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAssemblyAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiff,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiff.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: XmlDiffEmptyElement' XmlDiffEmptyElement (in method "CompareNodes" of class "XmlDiff").
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffDocument,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: nameTable
Unexploited Encapsulation,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffNavigator,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: XmlDiffDocument' XmlDiffElement (in method "MoveToFirstChild" of class "XmlDiffNavigator").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffDocument,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffDocument' System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffNavigator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffNavigator,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffNavigator' System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffDocument
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffElement,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffElement' System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffAttribute
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffAttribute,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffAttribute' System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffElement
Cyclic Hierarchy,System.Xml.XmlDiff,PositionInfo,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ReaderPositionInfo
Broken Hierarchy,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffEmptyElement,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): System.Xml.XmlDiff.XmlDiffElement
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffCharacterData,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteContentTo
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Xml.XmlDiff,XmlDiffProcessingInstruction,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\tests\System\Xml\XmlDiff\XmlDiffDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteContentTo
