Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,Directory,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\Directory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,Directory,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\Directory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,Directory,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\Directory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,DirectoryInfo,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\DirectoryInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,DirectoryInfo,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\DirectoryInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,File,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\File.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 66 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,File,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\File.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 82 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,File,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\File.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 183
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO,File,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\File.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.File' System.IO.PathInternal
Insufficient Modularization,System.IO,FileSystem,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\System.IO.FileSystem\src\System\IO\FileSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO,PathInternal,C:\selectedRepos\dotnet_corefx\src\Common\src\System\IO\PathInternal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.PathInternal' System.IO.File
