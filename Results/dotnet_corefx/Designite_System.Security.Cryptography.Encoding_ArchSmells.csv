Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,System.Security.Cryptography.Encoding,Internal.Cryptography,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Internal.Cryptography' System.Security.Cryptography,Internal.Cryptography.AsnFormatter' System.Security.Cryptography.AsnEncodedData
Feature Concentration,System.Security.Cryptography.Encoding,System.Security.Cryptography,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AsnEncodedData' AsnEncodedDataCollection' AsnEncodedDataEnumerator' Oid' OidCollection' OidEnumerator' OidGroup]' [FromBase64TransformMode' FromBase64Transform]' [ToBase64Transform]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.3,System.Security.Cryptography.FromBase64TransformMode' System.Security.Cryptography.FromBase64Transform' System.Security.Cryptography.ToBase64Transform
