Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,BondInEtwLinqpadDriver,BondDynamicDriver,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\BondDynamicDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Tx.Bond.LinqPad,EventStatisticCache,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\EventStatisticCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetTypeStatistics
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Bond.LinqPad,CsvRelatedStats,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\EventStatisticCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ManifestId' Statistics
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond.LinqPad,CsvRelatedStats,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\EventStatisticCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Bond.Extensions,EventStatistics,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\EventStatistics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EventCount' ByteSize' EventsPerSecond' AverageByteSize
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Bond.Extensions,Stats,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\Stats.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EventCount' ByteSize' ManifestId' MinTime' MaxTime
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond.Extensions,Stats,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\Stats.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BondEtwDriver.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unnecessary Abstraction,BondEtwDriver,TypeCacheItem,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\TypeCacheItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Manifest' Type
Broken Modularization,Tx.Bond.Extensions,Stats,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\BondEtw\LinqPadDriver\Stats.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EventCount' ByteSize' ManifestId' MinTime' MaxTime
