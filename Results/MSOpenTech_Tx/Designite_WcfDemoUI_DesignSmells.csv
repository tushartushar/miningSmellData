Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Windows.WcfInterception,StartRequest,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\WCF_Interception.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: operationName' requestMessageId
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Windows.WcfInterception,EndRequest,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\WCF_Interception.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: requestMessageId
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,App,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,MainWindow,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,MethodStatistics,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MethodName' TotalCount' TotalDuration' AverageDuration
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,HistogramBar,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Operation' Duration' Count
Unnecessary Abstraction,OutputUI.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,HistogramBar,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Operation' Duration' Count
Broken Hierarchy,Tx.Windows.WcfInterception,StartRequest,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\WCF_Interception.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tx.Windows.SystemEvent
Broken Hierarchy,Tx.Windows.WcfInterception,EndRequest,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfDemoUI\WCF_Interception.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tx.Windows.SystemEvent
