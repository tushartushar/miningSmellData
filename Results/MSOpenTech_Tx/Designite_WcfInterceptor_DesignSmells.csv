Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,MessageInspector,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfInterceptor\MessageInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,ParameterInspector,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfInterceptor\ParameterInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,MethodCallDuration,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfInterceptor\WcfEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,WcfEvent,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfInterceptor\WcfEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,MethodCallDuration,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfInterceptor\WcfEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: duration' methodName
Cyclic Hierarchy,Tx.Samples.WCFInterception,InterceptorBehaviorExtension,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\WcfInterception\WcfInterceptor\InterceptorBehaviorExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: InterceptorEndpointBehavior
