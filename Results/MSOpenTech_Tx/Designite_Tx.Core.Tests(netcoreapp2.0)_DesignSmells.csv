Imperative Abstraction,Tests.Tx,CompositeDeserializerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\CompositeDeserializerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DeserializeIntoMultipleTargets
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests.Tx,Envelope,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\CompositeDeserializerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Data' Timestamp
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests.Tx,DemultiplexorTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\DemultiplexorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests.Tx,ITestClassA,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\DemultiplexorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ValueA
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests.Tx,TestClassA,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\DemultiplexorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ValueA
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests.Tx,TestClassB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\DemultiplexorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ValueB
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests.Tx,TestClassC,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\DemultiplexorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ValueC
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests.Tx,EnvelopeTypeMapTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\EnvelopeTypeMapTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests.Tx,PlaybackTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\PlaybackTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests.Tx,PullMergeSortTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\PullMergeSortTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tests.Tx,Envelope,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Test\Tx.Core.Tests\CompositeDeserializerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Data' Timestamp
