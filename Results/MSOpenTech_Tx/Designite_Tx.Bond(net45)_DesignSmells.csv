Imperative Abstraction,Tx.Bond,BinaryEtlReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEtlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Subscribe
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond,BinaryEtlReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEtlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond,BinaryEtwEnvelopeWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEtwEnvelopeWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond,BinaryEtwSessionListener,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEtwSessionListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Tx.Bond,BinaryEventSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEventSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BinaryEventSource (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEventSource.cs' [31' 50])' BinaryEventSource (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEventSource.cs' [109' 128])
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond,EtwExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\EtwExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond,StringHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\Internal\StringHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Bond,TypeExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\Internal\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Bond,Protocol,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\Protocol.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Json' Bson' CompactBinaryV1' CompactBinaryV2
Deficient Encapsulation,Tx.Bond,BinaryEventSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEventSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Log
Deficient Encapsulation,Tx.Bond,BinaryEventSource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\BinaryEventSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Log
Broken Modularization,Tx.Bond,EventManifest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\EventManifest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ActivityId' OccurenceFileTimeUtc' ReceiveFileTimeUtc' Protocol' Source' ManifestId' Manifest
Broken Modularization,Tx.Bond,BondEnvelope,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Bond\Internal\BondEnvelope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ReceivedFileTimeUtc' OccurrenceFileTimeUtc' TypeId' Source' Protocol' Payload' OccurrenceTime' ReceivedTime' PayloadInstance
