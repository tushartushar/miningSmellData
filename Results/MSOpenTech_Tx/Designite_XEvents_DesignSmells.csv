Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.SqlServer.XEvent.Static,sql_statement_starting,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\Introduction\XEvents\XeStaticClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: state' line_number' offset' offset_end' statement
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.SqlServer.XEvent.Static,sql_statement_starting,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\Introduction\XEvents\XeStaticClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
