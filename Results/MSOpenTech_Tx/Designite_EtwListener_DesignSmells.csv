Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,EventTask,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,SmallEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,MediumEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' number1' number2' string1' string2
Feature Envy,EtwListener,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\Performance\EtwListener\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ListenWithPlayback which is more interested in members of the type: Playback
Broken Modularization,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,MediumEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' number1' number2' string1' string2
Broken Modularization,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,LargeEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' number1' number2' number3' number4' number5' number6' number7' number8' number9' number10' string1' string2' string3' string4' string5' string6' string7' string8' string9' string10
Broken Hierarchy,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,SmallEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tx.Windows.SystemEvent
Broken Hierarchy,Tx.Windows.Prototype_Eventing_Provider,MediumEvent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Generated\Prototype_Eventing_Provider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tx.Windows.SystemEvent
