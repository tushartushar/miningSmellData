(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,OdataListener.Constants,QueryOptions,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\OdataListener\OdataListener\Constants\ODataConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Top' Skip' Filter' OrderBy' Format
Broken Hierarchy,OdataListener.Entities,Parse,C:\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Samples\OdataListener\OdataListener\Entities\ParseEvent.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Tx.Windows.SystemEvent
