Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Windows,AssemblyBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Windows.TypeGeneration\AssemblyBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tx.Windows,PerfCounterParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Windows.TypeGeneration\PerfCounterParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Tx.Windows,TmfParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Windows.TypeGeneration\TmfParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse

Insufficient Modularization,Tx.Windows,ManifestParser,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Windows.TypeGeneration\ManifestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Broken Modularization,Tx.Windows,AttributeNames,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Windows.TypeGeneration\ManifestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Source' Name' Guid' Value' Symbol' Task' Map' Template' Tid' InType' Version' Opcode' Id' Message' EventGuid' MofValue' Length' Level' Channel' Chid' Keywords
Broken Modularization,Tx.Windows,ElementNames,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MSOpenTech_Tx\Source\Tx.Windows.TypeGeneration\ManifestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ns1' Instrumentation1' Localization1' Resources1' StringTable1' ns' Instrumentation' Provider' Events' Tasks' Maps' Templates' Opcodes' Localization' Resources' StringTable' Data' Channels' Keywords
