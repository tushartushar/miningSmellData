Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ractor,BaseActor,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SharedConnections' TopScheduler
Unutilized Abstraction,Ractor,BaseActor,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ractor,Actor<TReq;TResp>,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ractor,Message<T>,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' HasError' Error
Unutilized Abstraction,Ractor,Message<T>,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Ractor,PythonEchoActor,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\EchoActor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Ractor.PythonActor
Rebellious Hierarchy,Ractor,PythonActor,C:\repos\buybackoff_Ractor.CLR\src\Ractor\PythonActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Computation
