Unutilized Abstraction,test1,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,test1,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: test1.Class1' test2.Class1' test3.Class1' test4.Class1' test5.Class1
Unutilized Abstraction,test2,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,test2,Class2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,test2,Class2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: test2.Class2' test3.Class2
Unutilized Abstraction,test3,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,test3,Class2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,test4,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,test5,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,test1,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: meth1' meth1' meth1
Rebellious Hierarchy,test2,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: meth1
Rebellious Hierarchy,test3,Class1,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\0xd4d_de4dot\Test.Rename\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: meth1
