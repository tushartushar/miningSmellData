Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,AssemblyData(netcoreapp3.0),AssemblyData,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: AssemblyData' AssemblyData.methodsrewriter,AssemblyData.EmuStringDecrypter' AssemblyData.methodsrewriter.CodeGenerator,AssemblyData.EmuStringDecrypter' AssemblyData.methodsrewriter.CodeGenerator
Unstable Dependency,AssemblyData(netcoreapp3.0),AssemblyData,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): AssemblyData.methodsrewriter,AssemblyData.MethodsRewriter,AssemblyData.MethodsRewriter
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
