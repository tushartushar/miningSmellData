Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Database,AccessData,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TotalCount' TotalTime' ErrorCount' Watch
Duplicate Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySqlService,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: MySqlService[606' 629]' MySqlService[648' 671]
Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySQL,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,DogSE.Server.Database,AbstractDBEntityProfile,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Load' Insert' Update' Delete' Query' Seach' MatchesSeach
Deficient Encapsulation,DogSE.Server.Database,AccessData,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TotalCount' TotalTime' ErrorCount' Watch
Broken Modularization,DogSE.Server.Database,AbstractDBEntityProfile,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Load' Insert' Update' Delete' Query' Seach' MatchesSeach
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySqlService,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySqlConnectPool,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlConnectPool.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectPool
