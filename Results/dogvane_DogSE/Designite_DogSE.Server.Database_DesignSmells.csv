Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Database,AccessData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TotalCount' TotalTime' ErrorCount' Watch
Duplicate Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySqlService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MySqlService (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs' [606' 629])' MySqlService (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs' [648' 671])
Feature Envy,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySqlService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: QueryEntity which is more interested in members of the type: MySqlConnectPool

Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySQL,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,DogSE.Server.Database,AbstractDBEntityProfile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Load' Insert' Update' Delete' Query' Seach' MatchesSeach

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TotalCount' TotalTime' ErrorCount' Watch
Broken Modularization,DogSE.Server.Database,AbstractDBEntityProfile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\EntityProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Load' Insert' Update' Delete' Query' Seach' MatchesSeach
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Server.Database.MySQL,MySqlService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Database\MySql\MySqlService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
