Unutilized Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,ClientSession<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\ClientSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketConnectEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketDisconnectEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Session
Unutilized Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketDisconnectEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketRecvEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Session' Buffer
Unutilized Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketRecvEventArgs<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,Listener<T>,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Listener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,DogSE.Server.Net,NetProfile,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\NetProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SendCount' SendLength' RecvCount' RecvLength' AcceptCount' DisconnectCount' Instatnce' s_instance
Broken Hierarchy,DogSE.Server.Net,DogBuffer32K,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\DogBuffer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DogSE.Server.Net.DogBuffer
Cyclic Hierarchy,DogSE.Server.Net,DogBuffer,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\DogBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DogBuffer32K
