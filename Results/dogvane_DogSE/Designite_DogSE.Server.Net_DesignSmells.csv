Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketDisconnectEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Session
Unnecessary Abstraction,DogSE.Server.Net,SocketRecvEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\Delegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Session' Buffer
Broken Modularization,DogSE.Server.Net,NetProfile,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\NetProfile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SendCount' SendLength' RecvCount' RecvLength' AcceptCount' DisconnectCount' Instatnce' s_instance
Broken Hierarchy,DogSE.Server.Net,DogBuffer32K,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\DogBuffer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DogBuffer
Cyclic Hierarchy,DogSE.Server.Net,DogBuffer,F:\newReposMay17\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Server.Net\DogBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DogBuffer32K
