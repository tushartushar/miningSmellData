Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,DogSE.Server.Core,DogSE.Server.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: DogSE.Server.Core' DogSE.Server.Core.Timer
Unstable Dependency,DogSE.Server.Core,DogSE.Server.Core.Net,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DogSE.Server.Net
Unstable Dependency,DogSE.Server.Core,DogSE.Server.Core.Protocol,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DogSE.Server.Core.Task' DogSE.Server.Core.LogicModule
Unstable Dependency,DogSE.Server.Core,DogSE.Server.Core.Timer,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): DogSE.Server.Core
