Broken Modularization,DogSE.Library.Serialize,CsvFileCommon,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Serialize\CSVReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Delimiter' Quote' DelimiterIndex' QuoteIndex' SpecialChars
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Library.Util,ConvertByteArray,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Util\ConvertByteArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 104 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Library.Util,ConvertByteArray,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Util\ConvertByteArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 104 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Library.Util,ConvertByteArray,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Util\ConvertByteArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 139
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Library.Util,ConvertString,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Util\ConvertString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DogSE.Library.Util,ConvertString,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Util\ConvertString.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,DogSE.Library.Log,DebugAppender,C:\repos\dogvane_DogSE\DogSE\DogSE.Library\Log\DebugAppender.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
