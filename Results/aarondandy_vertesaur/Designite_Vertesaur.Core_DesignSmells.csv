The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TransformValues' GetInverse' GetInverse' TransformValue' TransformValues' GetInputTypes' GetOutputTypes
Multipath Hierarchy,Vertesaur.Transformation,ConcatenatedTransformation<TFrom;TTo>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aarondandy_vertesaur\src\Vertesaur.Core\Transformation\ConcatenatedTransformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ITransformation
