Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.IO,RecyclableMemoryStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\src\RecyclableMemoryStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.IO,Events,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\src\Events.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Writer
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.IO,Events,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\src\Events.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Writer
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.IO,BlockAndOffset,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\src\RecyclableMemoryStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Block' Offset
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.IO,RecyclableMemoryStreamManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\src\Events.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.IO,RecyclableMemoryStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\src\RecyclableMemoryStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
