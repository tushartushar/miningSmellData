Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Flurl,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Flurl.Util,CommonExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\Util\CommonExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Flurl,Url,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\Url.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Flurl,Url,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\Url.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Flurl,QueryParamCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\QueryParamCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Flurl.QueryParamCollection' Flurl.Url
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Flurl,QueryParameter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\QueryParameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Flurl.QueryParameter' Flurl.Url
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Flurl,QueryParamCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\QueryParamCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Flurl.QueryParamCollection' Flurl.Url' Flurl.QueryParameter
Rebellious Hierarchy,Flurl,Url,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tmenier_Flurl\src\Flurl\Url.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString' Equals' GetHashCode
