Unnecessary Abstraction,DropboxFS,ClientAccountsSection,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\ApplicationConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instances
Unutilized Abstraction,DropboxFS,ClientAccountsCollection,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\ApplicationConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropboxFS.Framework,TypeExtensions,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\Framework\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropboxFS.HelperClasses,CachedFileHelper,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\HelperClasses\CachedFileHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DropboxFS.HelperClasses,DokanExtensions,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\HelperClasses\DokanExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DropboxFS.DropboxBackend,DropboxCachedFile,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\DropboxBackend\DropboxCachedFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PreloadWindow
Insufficient Modularization,DropboxFS,DokanDefaultImplementation,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\DokanDefaultImplementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,DropboxFS,MainService,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\MainService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnPause' OnContinue
Broken Hierarchy,DropboxFS.DropboxBackend,DropboxImplementation,C:\repos\tkhadimullin_DropboxFS\DropboxFS\DropboxBackend\DropboxImplementation.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DokanDefaultImplementation
