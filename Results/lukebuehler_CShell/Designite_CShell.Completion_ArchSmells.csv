Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,CShell.Completion,CShell.Completion,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: CShell.Completion' CShell.Completion.DataItems,CShell.Completion.CodeTextEditor' CShell.Completion.CSharpCompletion' CShell.Completion.CSharpCompletionDataFactory' CShell.Completion.DataItems.EntityCompletionData' CShell.Completion.DataItems.OverrideCompletionData
Unstable Dependency,CShell.Completion,CShell.Completion.DataItems,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CShell.Completion,CShell.Completion.DataItems.SegmentTrackingOutputFormatter
Feature Concentration,CShell.Completion,CShell.Completion,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CodeTextEditor' CSharpOverloadProvider' CSharpCompletion' CSharpCompletionContext' CSharpCompletionDataFactory' CSharpInsightItem' ParameterHighlightingOutputFormatter]' [SegmentTrackingOutputFormatter]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,CShell.Completion.SegmentTrackingOutputFormatter
