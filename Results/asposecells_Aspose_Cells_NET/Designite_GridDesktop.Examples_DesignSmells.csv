(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GridDesktop.Examples,Form_RenderPivotTableInGridDesktop,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\PivotTablesInGridDesktop\Form_RenderPivotTableInGridDesktop.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,GridDesktop.Examples,RunExamples,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\RunExamples.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.98
Unutilized Abstraction,GridDesktop.Examples,RunExamples,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\RunExamples.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,GridDesktop.Examples.WorkingWithRowsandColumns,WorkingWithColumnValidations,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\WorkingWithRowsandColumns\WorkingWithColumnValidations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WorkingWithColumnValidations (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\WorkingWithRowsandColumns\WorkingWithColumnValidations.cs' [64' 98])' ValidationInWorksheets (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\WorkingWithWorksheet\ValidationInWorksheets.cs' [86' 120])
Duplicate Abstraction,GridDesktop.Examples.WorkingWithRowsandColumns,CustomValidation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\WorkingWithRowsandColumns\WorkingWithColumnValidations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: GridDesktop.Examples.WorkingWithRowsandColumns.CustomValidation' GridDesktop.Examples.WorkingWithWorksheet.CustomValidation
Unnecessary Abstraction,GridDesktop.Examples.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,GridDesktop.Examples,RunExamples,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asposecells_Aspose_Cells_NET\Examples_GridDesktop\CSharp\GridDesktop.Examples\RunExamples.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 51 methods
