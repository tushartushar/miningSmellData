Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,RealtimeFilterDemo,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.WindowsPhone\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  App (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.WindowsPhone\App.xaml.cs' [1' 21])' MainPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.WindowsPhone\MainPage.xaml.cs' [1' 21])' MainPageViewModel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.Shared\MainPageViewModel.cs' [1' 21])' Filter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.Shared\Filter.cs' [1' 21])
Feature Envy,RealtimeFilterDemo,MainPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.WindowsPhone\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Current_VisibilityChanged which is more interested in members of the type: MainPageViewModel
Unnecessary Abstraction,RealtimeFilterDemo,Filter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.Shared\Filter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Type' Parameters
Unutilized Abstraction,RealtimeFilterDemo.Common,BasicPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_real-time-filter-demo\RealtimeFilterDemoWindows\RealtimeFilterDemo.Shared\Common\BasicPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
