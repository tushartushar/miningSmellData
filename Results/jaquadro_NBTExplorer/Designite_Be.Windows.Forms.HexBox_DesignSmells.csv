Unutilized Abstraction,Be.Windows.Forms,ByteCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\ByteCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Be.Windows.Forms,HexBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HexBox (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs' [660' 682])' HexBox (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs' [1024' 1046])
Feature Envy,Be.Windows.Forms,KeyInterpreter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PreProcessWmKeyDown_Default which is more interested in members of the type: HexBox
Insufficient Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,HexBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 96 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,HexBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 261
Insufficient Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,KeyInterpreter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,KeyInterpreter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
Rebellious Hierarchy,Be.Windows.Forms,FileByteProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\FileByteProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DeleteBytes' InsertBytes
Rebellious Hierarchy,Be.Windows.Forms,EmptyKeyInterpreter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Activate' Deactivate
