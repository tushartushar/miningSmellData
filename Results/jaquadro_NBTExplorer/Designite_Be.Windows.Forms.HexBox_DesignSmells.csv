Unutilized Abstraction,Be.Windows.Forms,ByteCollection,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\ByteCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Be.Windows.Forms,HexBox,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: HexBox[660' 682]' HexBox[1024' 1046]
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,BuiltInContextMenu,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\BuiltInContextMenu.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BuiltInContextMenu' HexBox
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,DataBlock,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\DataBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DataBlock' DataMap
Insufficient Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,HexBox,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 96 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Be.Windows.Forms,HexBox,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\HexBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 239
Rebellious Hierarchy,Be.Windows.Forms,FileByteProvider,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTExplorer\Vendor\Be.Windows.Forms.HexBox\FileByteProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DeleteBytes' InsertBytes
