Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,NBTUtil,ConsoleRunner,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\ConsoleRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unutilized Abstraction,NDesk.Options,OptionException,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,NBTUtil.Ops,EditOperation,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\Ops\EditOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TagDataNode' TagByteArrayDataNode' TagShortArrayDataNode (in method "CanProcess" of class "EditOperation").
Unexploited Encapsulation,NBTUtil.Ops,JsonOperation,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\Ops\JsonOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TagDataNode' NbtFileDataNode (in method "Process" of class "JsonOperation").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionSet' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext' Option' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionSet' OptionContext' Option' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionContext,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionContext' Option
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionContext,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionContext' Option' OptionSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,Option,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Option' OptionContext' OptionSet' OptionContext
Insufficient Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 127
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionSet,F:\newReposMay17\jaquadro_NBTExplorer\NBTUtil\NDesk\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionSet' OptionContext
