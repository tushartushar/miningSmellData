Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,ApplicationConfiguration,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Host' ExePath' CommandLineArgs' UserName' UserPassword
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,WebSocketService,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\WebSocketService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
