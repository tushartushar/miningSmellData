Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,ApplicationConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Host' ExePath' CommandLineArgs' UserName' UserPassword
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,HostServiceImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\HostServiceImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HostServiceImpl which is more interested in members of the type: WebSocketServerBase
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,WebSocketServiceInstaller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\WebSocketServiceInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,ServiceConfigurationSection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ListenUrl' CertificateSerialNumber' RuntimeConfigPath' HostPipeName' AppPipeName' ApplicationTerminateTimeout' ApplicationInactiveTimeout' ApplicationInactiveCheckInterval
Broken Modularization,DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host,ApplicationConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.Host\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Host' ExePath' CommandLineArgs' UserName' UserPassword
