Imperative Abstraction,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,MetadataGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\Generators\MetadataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Generate
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,MetadataGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\Generators\MetadataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetUrlParameters which is more interested in members of the type: GeneratorHelper
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,MetadataGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\Generators\MetadataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetRequestParameters which is more interested in members of the type: GeneratorHelper
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,MetadataGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\Generators\MetadataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetResponseParameters which is more interested in members of the type: GeneratorHelper
Imperative Abstraction,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,WsMetadataGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\Generators\WsMetadataGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Generate
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,XmlCommentExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\XmlCommentReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.DocGenerator,Metadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.DocGenerator\Metadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
