Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHiveTest,CubeColor,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\Examples\BinaryClient\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' R' G' B
Deficient Encapsulation,DeviceHiveTest,CubePixel,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\Examples\BinaryClient\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' Z' R' G' B
