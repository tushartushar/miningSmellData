Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceEquipmentInfo,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceEquipmentInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DeviceEquipmentInfo[9' 28]' DeviceEquipmentAttribute[14' 33]
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,ApiInfo,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\ApiInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ApiVersion' ServerTimestamp' WebSocketServerUrl
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceServiceException,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\DeviceServiceException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,ReflectionExtensioins,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Helpers\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceCommand,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DeviceCommand[57' 77]' DeviceNotification[79' 99]
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceEquipmentAttribute,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceEquipmentAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,DeviceHive.Device,ReflectionExtensioins,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Helpers\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DeviceHive.Device,RestfulDeviceService,F:\newReposMay17\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\RestfulDeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
