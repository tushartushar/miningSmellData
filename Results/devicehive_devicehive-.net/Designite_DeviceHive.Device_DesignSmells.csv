Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceEquipmentInfo,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceEquipmentInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DeviceEquipmentInfo (C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceEquipmentInfo.cs' [9' 28])' DeviceEquipmentAttribute (C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceEquipmentAttribute.cs' [14' 33])
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,ApiInfo,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\ApiInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ApiVersion' ServerTimestamp' WebSocketServerUrl
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceServiceException,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\DeviceServiceException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,ReflectionExtensioins,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Helpers\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,DeviceCommand,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DeviceCommand (C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceCommand.cs' [57' 77])' DeviceNotification (C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Device\DeviceNotification.cs' [79' 99])
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,Equipment,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\Equipment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,JsonContractResolver,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\RestfulDeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Device,RequestInfo,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\WebSocketDeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Result' WaitHandle' _eventWaitHandle' _result
Insufficient Modularization,DeviceHive.Device,ReflectionExtensioins,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Helpers\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeviceHive.Device,RestfulDeviceService,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\RestfulDeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DeviceHive.Device.RestfulDeviceService' DeviceHive.Device.CommandSubscriptionTask
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeviceHive.Device,CommandSubscriptionTask,C:\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Device\Service\RestfulDeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DeviceHive.Device.CommandSubscriptionTask' DeviceHive.Device.RestfulDeviceService
