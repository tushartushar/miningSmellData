Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,BinaryReaderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\BinaryReaderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,BinaryWriterExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\BinaryWriterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,EquipmentInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\DeviceRegistrationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Code' TypeName
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,NotificationMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\DeviceRegistrationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Intent' Name' Parameters
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,CommandMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\DeviceRegistrationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Intent' Name' Parameters
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,GatewayService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\GatewayService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeviceHive.Binary,Intents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\Intents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RequestRegistration' Register' NotifyCommandResult' Register2' User
Insufficient Modularization,DeviceHive.Binary,BinaryServiceBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\BinaryServiceBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Broken Modularization,DeviceHive.Binary,DeviceRegistrationInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\DeviceRegistrationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Key' Name' ClassName' ClassVersion' Equipment' Notifications' Commands
Broken Modularization,DeviceHive.Binary,Intents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\Intents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RequestRegistration' Register' NotifyCommandResult' Register2' User
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeviceHive.Binary,BinaryConnectionBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\BinaryConnections.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect' Read' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeviceHive.Binary,StubBinaryConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Device\DeviceHive.Binary\BinaryConnections.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Connect
