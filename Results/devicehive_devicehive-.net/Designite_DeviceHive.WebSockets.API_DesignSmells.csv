Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.WebSockets.API.Controllers,DeviceController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.API\Controllers\DeviceController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UnsubsrcibeFromDeviceCommands which is more interested in members of the type: DeviceSubscriptionManager
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.WebSockets.API.Service,HostedAppServiceImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.API\Service\HostedAppServiceImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HostedAppServiceImpl which is more interested in members of the type: ApplicationService
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.WebSockets.API.Service,HostedAppServiceImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.API\Service\HostedAppServiceImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Run which is more interested in members of the type: ApplicationService
Feature Envy,DeviceHive.WebSockets.API.Service,SelfHostServiceImpl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.API\Service\SelfHostServiceImpl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SelfHostServiceImpl which is more interested in members of the type: WebSocketServerBase
Unutilized Abstraction,DeviceHive.WebSockets.API.Service,WebSocketServiceInstaller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\devicehive_devicehive-.net\src\Server\DeviceHive.WebSockets.API\Service\WindowsServiceInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
