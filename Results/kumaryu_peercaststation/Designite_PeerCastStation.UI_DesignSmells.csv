Feature Envy,PeerCastStation.UI.PortMapper,UPnPService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\PortMapper\UPnPDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ParseActionResponse which is more interested in members of the type: Logger
Unnecessary Abstraction,PeerCastStation.UI.PortMapper,SupportedService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\PortMapper\UPnPDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Device' Service' Type
Deficient Encapsulation,PeerCastStation.UI.PortMapper,SupportedService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\PortMapper\UPnPDevice.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Device' Service' Type
Broken Modularization,PeerCastStation.UI,BroadcastInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\UISettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NetworkType' StreamType' StreamUrl' Bitrate' ContentType' YellowPage' ChannelName' Genre' Description' Comment' ContactUrl' TrackTitle' TrackAlbum' TrackArtist' TrackGenre' TrackUrl' Favorite
Broken Modularization,PeerCastStation.UI,VersionEnclosure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\Updater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Title' Length' Type' Url' InstallerType
Broken Modularization,PeerCastStation.UI,VersionDescription,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\Updater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PublishDate' Link' Title' Description' Enclosures
Broken Modularization,PeerCastStation.UI,ChannelsCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\YPChannelList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsValid' Value' CacheLimit' cacheTimer' channels
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeerCastStation.UI.PortMapper,MappedPort,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\PortMapper\NatDeviceDiscoverer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PeerCastStation.UI.PortMapper.MappedPort' PeerCastStation.UI.PortMapper.INatDevice
Broken Hierarchy,PeerCastStation.UI,NewVersionNotificationMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\Updater.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PeerCastStation.Core.NotificationMessage
Rebellious Hierarchy,PeerCastStation.UI,YPChannelList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.UI\YPChannelList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
