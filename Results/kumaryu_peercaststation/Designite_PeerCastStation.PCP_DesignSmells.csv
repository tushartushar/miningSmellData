Unnecessary Abstraction,PeerCastStation.PCP,PeerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RemoteEndPoint' Host' UserAgent
Feature Envy,PeerCastStation.PCP,ChannelSink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ChannelSink which is more interested in members of the type: ConnectionInfoBuilder
Imperative Abstraction,PeerCastStation.PCP,PCPSourceConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetConnectionInfo
Feature Envy,PeerCastStation.PCP,PCPSourceConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CheckHostInfoUpdate which is more interested in members of the type: LocalHostInfo
Unnecessary Abstraction,PeerCastStation.PCP,LocalHostInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Timestamp' LocalDirects' LocalRelays
Imperative Abstraction,PeerCastStation.PCP,PCPSourceStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetConnectionInfo
Feature Envy,PeerCastStation.PCP,PCPYellowPageConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPYellowPageClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnPCPOleh which is more interested in members of the type: PeerCast
Unnecessary Abstraction,PeerCastStation.PCP,BannedException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPYellowPageClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,PeerCastStation.PCP,ParsedRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Status' ChannelId' Extension
Deficient Encapsulation,PeerCastStation.PCP,ChannelMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Timestamp' Type' Content' Data
Deficient Encapsulation,PeerCastStation.PCP,LocalHostInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Timestamp' LocalDirects' LocalRelays
Insufficient Modularization,PeerCastStation.PCP,PCPSourceConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,PeerCastStation.PCP,PCPSourceConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PeerCastStation.PCP,BundledYPConnectionPool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.PCP\PCPYellowPageClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PeerCastStation.PCP.BundledYPConnectionPool' PeerCastStation.PCP.PCPYellowPageClient
