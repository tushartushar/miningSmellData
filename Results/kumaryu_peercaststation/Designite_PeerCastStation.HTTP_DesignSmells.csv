Unutilized Abstraction,PeerCastStation.HTTP,HTTPChunkedContentStream,C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPChunkedContentStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PeerCastStation.HTTP,HTTPChunkedContentStream,C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPChunkedContentStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  HTTPChunkedContentStream (C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPChunkedContentStream.cs' [71' 102])' HTTPChunkedContentStream (C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPChunkedContentStream.cs' [129' 160])
Unutilized Abstraction,PeerCastStation.HTTP,WaitableQueue<T>,C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPOutputStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,PeerCastStation.HTTP,HTTPPushSourceConnection,C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPPushSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetConnectionInfo
Unnecessary Abstraction,PeerCastStation.HTTP,ConnectionStoppedExcception,C:\repos\kumaryu_peercaststation\PeerCastStation\PeerCastStation.HTTP\HTTPPushSourceStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
