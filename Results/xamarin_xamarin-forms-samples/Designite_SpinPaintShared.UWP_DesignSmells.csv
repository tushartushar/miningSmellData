Duplicate Abstraction,SpinPaintShared.UWP,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared.UWP\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SpinPaintShared.UWP.App' SpinPaintShared.App
Duplicate Abstraction,SpinPaintShared.UWP,MainPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared.UWP\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: SpinPaintShared.UWP.MainPage' SpinPaintShared.MainPage
Unutilized Abstraction,TouchTracking.UWP,TouchEffect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared.UWP\TouchEffect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TouchTracking.UWP,TouchEffect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared.UWP\TouchEffect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: TouchTracking.UWP.TouchEffect' TouchTracking.TouchEffect
Unnecessary Abstraction,SpinPaintShared,FingerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ThisPosition' LastPosition
Deficient Encapsulation,SpinPaintShared,FingerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\MainPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ThisPosition' LastPosition
Rebellious Hierarchy,SpinPaintShared,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SkiaSharpForms\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\SpinPaintShared\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStart' OnSleep' OnResume
