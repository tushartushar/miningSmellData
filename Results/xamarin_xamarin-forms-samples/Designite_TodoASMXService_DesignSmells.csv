Unnecessary Abstraction,TodoASMXService.Models,TodoItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\WebServices\TodoASMX\TodoASMXService\TodoASMXService\Models\TodoItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Notes' Done
Duplicate Abstraction,TodoASMXService.Services,TodoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\WebServices\TodoASMX\TodoASMXService\TodoASMXService\Services\TodoService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: TodoASMXService.Services.TodoService' TodoASMXService.TodoService
Unutilized Abstraction,TodoASMXService,TodoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\WebServices\TodoASMX\TodoASMXService\TodoASMXService\TodoService.asmx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TodoASMXService,TodoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\WebServices\TodoASMX\TodoASMXService\TodoASMXService\TodoService.asmx.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateTodoItem which is more interested in members of the type: ITodoService
Feature Envy,TodoASMXService,TodoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\WebServices\TodoASMX\TodoASMXService\TodoASMXService\TodoService.asmx.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: EditTodoItem which is more interested in members of the type: ITodoService
Feature Envy,TodoASMXService,TodoService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\WebServices\TodoASMX\TodoASMXService\TodoASMXService\TodoService.asmx.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DeleteTodoItem which is more interested in members of the type: ITodoService
