Unnecessary Abstraction,DeepLinking,TodoItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Models\TodoItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Notes' Done
Duplicate Abstraction,DeepLinking,TodoItemPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoItemPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TodoItemPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoItemPage.xaml.cs' [19' 82])' TodoItemPageCS (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoItemPageCS.cs' [53' 116])
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepLinking,TodoItemPageCS,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoItemPageCS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DeepLinking,TodoListPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoListPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TodoListPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoListPage.xaml.cs' [11' 44])' TodoListPageCS (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoListPageCS.cs' [41' 74])
Unutilized Abstraction,DeepLinking,TodoListPageCS,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoListPageCS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,DeepLinking,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AppName
Deficient Encapsulation,DeepLinking,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AppName
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeepLinking,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DeepLinking.App' DeepLinking.TodoItemPage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeepLinking,TodoListPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\Views\TodoListPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DeepLinking.TodoListPage' DeepLinking.App
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeepLinking,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DeepLinking.App' DeepLinking.TodoItemPage' DeepLinking.TodoListPage
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeepLinking,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\DeepLinking\DeepLinking\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStart' OnSleep' OnResume
