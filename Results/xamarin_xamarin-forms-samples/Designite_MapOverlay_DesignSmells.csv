Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MapOverlay,CustomCircle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\CustomRenderers\Map\Circle\MapOverlay\CustomCircle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Position' Radius
Unnecessary Abstraction,MapOverlay,CustomMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\CustomRenderers\Map\Circle\MapOverlay\CustomMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Circle
Unutilized Abstraction,MapOverlay,MapPageCS,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\CustomRenderers\Map\Circle\MapOverlay\MapPageCS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,MapOverlay,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\CustomRenderers\Map\Circle\MapOverlay\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ScreenHeight' ScreenWidth
Deficient Encapsulation,MapOverlay,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\CustomRenderers\Map\Circle\MapOverlay\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ScreenHeight' ScreenWidth
Rebellious Hierarchy,MapOverlay,App,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\CustomRenderers\Map\Circle\MapOverlay\App.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnStart' OnSleep' OnResume
