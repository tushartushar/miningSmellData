Feature Envy,ConceptDevelopment.Net.Cryptography,PontifexSolitaire,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xamarin_xamarin-forms-samples\SolitaireEncryption\Solitaire\Algorithm\PontifexSolitaire.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PontifexSolitaire which is more interested in members of the type: Deck
