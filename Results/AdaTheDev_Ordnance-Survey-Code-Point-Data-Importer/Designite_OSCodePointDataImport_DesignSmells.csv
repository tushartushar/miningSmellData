Unnecessary Abstraction,OSCodePointDataImport,IArgParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdaTheDev_Ordnance-Survey-Code-Point-Data-Importer\OSCodePointDataImport\ArgumentParsers\IArgParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ImportOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,OSCodePointDataImport,IArgParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdaTheDev_Ordnance-Survey-Code-Point-Data-Importer\OSCodePointDataImport\ArgumentParsers\IArgParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OSCodePointDataImport,ImportFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdaTheDev_Ordnance-Survey-Code-Point-Data-Importer\OSCodePointDataImport\ImportFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
