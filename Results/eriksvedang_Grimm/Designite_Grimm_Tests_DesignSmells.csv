Unutilized Abstraction,GrimmLib.tests,ConversationPrinterTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\ConversationPrinterTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GrimmLib.tests,DialogueRunnerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\DialogueRunnerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs' [698' 718])' LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs' [750' 770])

Feature Envy,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Basics which is more interested in members of the type: DialogueRunner
Feature Envy,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadingADialogueWithOptions which is more interested in members of the type: DialogueRunner
Insufficient Modularization,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 53 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GrimmLib.tests,LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\eriksvedang_Grimm\Grimm_Tests\tests\LoadConversationsFromScriptFilesTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
