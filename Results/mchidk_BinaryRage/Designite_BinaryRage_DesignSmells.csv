Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\Properties\AssemblyVersionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\Properties\AssemblyVersionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BinaryRage,Cache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\Cache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' LockObject' CacheDic' counter
Unutilized Abstraction,BinaryRage,DB,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\DB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BinaryRage,SimpleObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\SimpleObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' Value' FileLocation
Deficient Encapsulation,BinaryRage,Cache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\Cache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LockObject' CacheDic' counter
Deficient Encapsulation,BinaryRage,Cache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mchidk_BinaryRage\Cache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LockObject' CacheDic' counter
