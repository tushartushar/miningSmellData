Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,D-IDE.Core,D_IDE,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: D_IDE' D_IDE.Core,D_IDE.AbstractEditorDocument' D_IDE.Core.EditorDocument
Unstable Dependency,D-IDE.Core,D_IDE.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): D_IDE,D_IDE.Core.CommonEditorSettings' D_IDE.Core.AbstractEditorDocument' D_IDE.Core.GlobalProperties' D_IDE.Core.LanguageLoader
Ambiguous Interface,D-IDE.Core,D_IDE.Core.Controls,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: ListSelectionDialog,D_IDE.Core.Controls.ListSelectionDialog
God Component,D-IDE.Core,D_IDE.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 38,D_IDE.Core.IEditorDocument' D_IDE.Core.BreakpointWrapper' D_IDE.Core.BuildResult' D_IDE.Core.IDEInterface' D_IDE.Core.FileTemplate' D_IDE.Core.OutputTypes' D_IDE.Core.BuildAction' D_IDE.Core.ErrorType' D_IDE.Core.ErrorOrigin
Feature Concentration,D-IDE.Core,Aga.Controls.Tree,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LevelToIndentConverter]' [CanExpandConverter]' [ITreeModel' TreeList' TreeListItem' TreeNode' NodeCollection]' [RowExpander]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,Aga.Controls.Tree.LevelToIndentConverter' Aga.Controls.Tree.CanExpandConverter' Aga.Controls.Tree.RowExpander
