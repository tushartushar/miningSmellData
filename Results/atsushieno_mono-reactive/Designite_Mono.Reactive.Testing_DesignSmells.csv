Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Reactive.Testing,ReactiveAssert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_mono-reactive\Mono.Reactive.Testing\Mono.Reactive.Testing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mono.Reactive.Testing,TestableObservable<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_mono-reactive\Mono.Reactive.Testing\Mono.Reactive.Testing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mono.Reactive.Testing.TestableObservable<T>' Mono.Reactive.Testing.TestScheduler
