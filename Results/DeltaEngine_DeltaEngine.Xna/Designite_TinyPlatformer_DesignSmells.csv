Imperative Abstraction,TinyPlatformer,Actor,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Samples\TinyPlatformer\Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Update
Multifaceted Abstraction,TinyPlatformer,Actor,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Samples\TinyPlatformer\Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Multifaceted Abstraction,TinyPlatformer,Map,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Samples\TinyPlatformer\Map.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Deficient Encapsulation,TinyPlatformer,Map,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Samples\TinyPlatformer\Map.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ScreenGap
Deficient Encapsulation,TinyPlatformer,Map,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Samples\TinyPlatformer\Map.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ScreenGap
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TinyPlatformer,Actor,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Samples\TinyPlatformer\Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Actor' Map
