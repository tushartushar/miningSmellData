Unutilized Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Physics2D,Entity2DPhysicsExtensions,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Physics2D\Entity2DPhysicsExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Physics2D,Velocity2D,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.Xna\Physics2D\Velocity2D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
