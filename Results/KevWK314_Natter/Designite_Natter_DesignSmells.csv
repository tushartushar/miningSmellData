Broken Modularization,Natter.Byte,ByteValues,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Byte\ByteValues.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' GreaterThan' LessThan' Comma' Equal' GreaterThanArray' LessThanArray' CommaArray' EqualArray' SpaceArray' StartMessage' EndMessage' MessageType' ConnectionId' TransactionId' From
Insufficient Modularization,Natter.Connecting,NatterConnection,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\NatterConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Natter.Connecting,NatterConnection,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\NatterConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NatterConnection' CallingStateManager' StateManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Natter.Connecting,NatterConnection,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\NatterConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NatterConnection' ConnectedStateManager' DisconnectedStateManager' StateManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Natter.Connecting,NatterConnection,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\NatterConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NatterConnection' ConnectedStateManager' DisconnectedStateManager' CallingStateManager' StateManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Natter.Connecting.States,CallingStateManager,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\States\CallingStateManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CallingStateManager' StateManager' NatterConnection' ConnectedStateManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Natter.Connecting.States,ConnectedStateManager,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\States\ConnectedStateManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ConnectedStateManager' DisconnectedStateManager
Broken Hierarchy,Natter.Client,MemoryNatterClient,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Client\MemoryNatterClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NatterClient
Broken Hierarchy,Natter.Client,TcpNatterClient,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Client\TcpNatterClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NatterClient
Broken Hierarchy,Natter.Client,UdpNatterClient,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Client\UdpNatterClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NatterClient
Rebellious Hierarchy,Natter.Connecting.States,CallingStateManager,C:\repos\KevWK314_Natter\Natter\Connecting\States\CallingStateManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
