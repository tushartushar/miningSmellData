Insufficient Modularization,Chronic.Tests.Parsing,KnownPatternsParsingTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\robertwilczynski_nChronic\src\Chronic.Tests\Parsing\KnownPatternsParsingTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
