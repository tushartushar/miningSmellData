Unnecessary Abstraction,FNHS.Samples.SearchMappings,BookSearchMap,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\trullock_Fluent-NHibernate-Search\src\FNHS.Samples\SearchMappings\BookSearchMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
