Unnecessary Abstraction,WordSlideEngine,Font,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' family' size
Unnecessary Abstraction,WordSlideEngine,Slide,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Slide.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,WordSlideEngine,EditableSlide,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Slide.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Deficient Encapsulation,WordSlideEngine,Font,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: family' size
Deficient Encapsulation,WordSlideEngine,DisplaySlide,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Slide.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: firstslide' lastslide' title' by' text' copyright' blank' linesperslide
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WordSlideEngine,Engine,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Engine' Options
Insufficient Modularization,WordSlideEngine,Options,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Broken Hierarchy,WordSlideEngine,EditableSlideSet,C:\repos\Asky314159_wordslide\win32\WordSlideEngine\EditableSlideSet.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SlideSet
