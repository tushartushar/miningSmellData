Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SerializationTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SerializationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SerializationTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SerializationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestNonSerializableMemberInitialization which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Unutilized Abstraction,PerpetualEngine.Storage,JsonPersistingListTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\JsonPersistingListTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PerpetualEngine.Storage,PersistenListTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\PersistenListTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PerpetualEngine.Storage,PersistentStringsTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\PersistentStringsTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestSavingString which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestSavingSimpleArray which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestSavingDateTime which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestSavingTimeSpan which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestSavingList which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestLoadingDefaultTimeSpan which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestNonexistentKeys which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Feature Envy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,SimpleStorageTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SimpleStorageTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: StoredKeys_AreEmpty_AfterDelete which is more interested in members of the type: SimpleStorage
Deficient Encapsulation,PerpetualEngine.Storage,ClassWithNonSerializableMembers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\SerializationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TestInteger
Broken Hierarchy,PerpetualEngine.Storage,JsonTestItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\perpetual-mobile_SimpleStorage\Tests\JsonPersistingListTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PerpetualEngine.Storage.TestItem
