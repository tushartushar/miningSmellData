Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation.Interop,InteropVector4,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation\Interop\InteropVector4.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y' Z' W
Deficient Encapsulation,SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation.Interop,InteropTransform,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation\Interop\InteropTransform.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Translation' Scale' Rotation
Deficient Encapsulation,SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation.Interop,InteropVector4,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation\Interop\InteropVector4.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' Z' W
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation,Animation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation\Animation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation.Animation' SaintCoinach.Graphics.Animation.AnimationContainer
