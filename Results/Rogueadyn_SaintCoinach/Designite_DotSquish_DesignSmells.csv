Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,DotSquish,ClusterFit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\DotSquish\ClusterFit.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConstructOrdering which is more interested in members of the type: ColourSet
Unutilized Abstraction,DotSquish,SquishOptionsExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\DotSquish\Flags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DotSquish,Squish,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\DotSquish\Squish.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,DotSquish,Vector3,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\DotSquish\Maths.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' Z
Deficient Encapsulation,DotSquish,Vector4,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\DotSquish\Maths.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y' Z' W
Rebellious Hierarchy,DotSquish,ClusterFit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Rogueadyn_SaintCoinach\DotSquish\ClusterFit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Compress4
