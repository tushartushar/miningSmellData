The participating classes in the cycle are: TestFx.Evaluation.Results.ISuiteResultHolder' TestFx.Evaluation.Results.ISuiteResult
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TestFx.Evaluation,EvaluationModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Evaluation\EvaluationModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TestFx.Evaluation.EvaluationModule' TestFx.Evaluation.Runners.AssemblyRunnerFactory' TestFx.Evaluation.Runners.RootRunner
Rebellious Hierarchy,TestFx.Evaluation.Reporting,RunListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Evaluation\Reporting\RunListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnRunStarted' OnRunFinished' OnSuiteStarted' OnSuiteFinished' OnTestStarted' OnTestFinished' OnError
Rebellious Hierarchy,TestFx.Evaluation.Utilities,ThrowingTraceListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Evaluation\Utilities\ThrowingTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write' WriteLine' Fail' Fail
Broken Hierarchy,TestFx.Extensibility.Controllers,ClassSuiteController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Controllers\ClassSuiteController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestFx.Extensibility.Controllers.SuiteController
Unfactored Hierarchy,TestFx.Extensibility.Providers,IOperationCollectionProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Providers\OperationCollectionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  IOperationCollectionProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Providers\OperationCollectionProvider.cs' [1' 22])' ISuiteProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Providers\SuiteProvider.cs' [1' 22])
Unfactored Hierarchy,TestFx.Extensibility.Providers,IOperationProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Providers\OperationProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  IOperationProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Providers\OperationProvider.cs' [1' 20])' ITestProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Extensibility\Providers\TestProvider.cs' [1' 20])' IOutputResult (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Evaluation\Results\OutputResult.cs' [1' 20])' ITestResult (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Evaluation\Results\TestResult.cs' [1' 20])
Cyclic Hierarchy,TestFx.Evaluation.Results,ISuiteResultHolder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matkoch_TestFx\src\TestFx.Core\Evaluation\Results\ISuiteResultHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ISuiteResult
