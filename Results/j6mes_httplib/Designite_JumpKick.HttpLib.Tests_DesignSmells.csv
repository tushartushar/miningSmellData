Rebellious Hierarchy,JumpKick.HttpLib.Tests,RequestWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib.Tests\RequestTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteRequestWithBody' ExecuteRequestWithoutBody
Broken Hierarchy,JumpKick.HttpLib.Tests,RequestWrapper2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib.Tests\RequestTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JumpKick.HttpLib.Request
