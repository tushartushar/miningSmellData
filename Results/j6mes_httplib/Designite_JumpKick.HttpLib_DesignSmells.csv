Imperative Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib,Request,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Go
Unutilized Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib,Http,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Http.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib,RequestTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\RequestTemplate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib,RequestTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\RequestTemplate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib.Provider,ActionProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Provider\ActionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Make' Success' Fail
Unnecessary Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib.Provider,NonActionProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Provider\NonActionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Make' Success' Fail
Feature Envy,JumpKick.HttpLib.Provider,SettableActionProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Provider\SettableActionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SettableActionProvider which is more interested in members of the type: NonActionProvider
Unnecessary Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib.Streams,ProgressChangedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Streams\ProgressChangedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BytesCopied' TotalBytes
Unutilized Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib.Streams,ProgressChangedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Streams\ProgressChangedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JumpKick.HttpLib.Streams,ProgressMonitorStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Streams\ProgressMonitorStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,JumpKick.HttpLib.Provider,MultipartBodyProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Provider\MultipartBodyProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OnProgressChangeCallback' OnCompletedCallback
Insufficient Modularization,JumpKick.HttpLib.Builder,RequestBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Builder\RequestBuilder.Action.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,JumpKick.HttpLib.Builder,RequestBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Builder\RequestBuilder.Action.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,JumpKick.HttpLib.Provider,DefaultBodyProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\j6mes_httplib\JumpKick.HttpLib\JumpKick.HttpLib\Provider\DefaultBodyProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnProgressChange' OnCompleted' GetContentType' GetBody
