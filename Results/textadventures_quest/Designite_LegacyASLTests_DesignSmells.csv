Unutilized Abstraction,LegacyASLTests,LegacyGameTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\LegacyASLTests\LegacyGameTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,LegacyASLTests,LegacyGameTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\LegacyASLTests\LegacyGameTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestWait which is more interested in members of the type: TestPlayer

Multifaceted Abstraction,LegacyASLTests,TestPlayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\LegacyASLTests\TestPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Insufficient Modularization,LegacyASLTests,TestPlayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\LegacyASLTests\TestPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LegacyASLTests,TestPlayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\LegacyASLTests\TestPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,LegacyASLTests,TestPlayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\LegacyASLTests\TestPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetWindowMenu' PlaySound' StopSound' WriteHTML' ClearScreen' ShowPicture' SetPanesVisible' RunScript' Quit' Speak' RequestSave' SetLinkForeground' Show' Hide' SetCompassDirections' DoPause' SetInterfaceString' SetPanelContents' Log
