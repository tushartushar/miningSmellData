Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,EditorControllerTests,EditorControllerTestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\EditorControllerTestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Init which is more interested in members of the type: EditorController
Unnecessary Abstraction,EditorControllerTests,EditorTreeItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\EditorTreeData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Parent' Key' Text
Unutilized Abstraction,EditorControllerTests,TemplateTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\TemplateTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EditorControllerTests,UtilityTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\UtilityTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,EditorControllerTests,EditorTreeItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\EditorTreeData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Parent' Key' Text
Broken Hierarchy,EditorControllerTests,EditableScriptTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\EditableScriptTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EditorControllerTests.EditorControllerTestBase
Broken Hierarchy,EditorControllerTests,EditorControllerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\textadventures_quest\EditorControllerTests\EditorControllerTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): EditorControllerTests.EditorControllerTestBase
