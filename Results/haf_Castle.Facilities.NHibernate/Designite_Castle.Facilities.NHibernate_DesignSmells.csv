Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,IConfigurationPersisterContract,C:\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\IConfigurationPersisterContract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IConfigurationPersisterContract (C:\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\IConfigurationPersisterContract.cs' [1' 20])' INHibernateInstallerContract (C:\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\INHibernateInstallerContract.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,Data,C:\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\NHibernateFacility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Instance' Config' Factory
Deficient Encapsulation,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,Data,C:\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\NHibernateFacility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance' Config' Factory
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,INHibernateInstallerContract,C:\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\INHibernateInstallerContract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Deserialize
