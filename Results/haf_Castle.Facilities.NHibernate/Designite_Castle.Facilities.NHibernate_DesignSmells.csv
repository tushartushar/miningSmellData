Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,IConfigurationPersisterContract,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\IConfigurationPersisterContract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IConfigurationPersisterContract (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\IConfigurationPersisterContract.cs' [1' 20])' INHibernateInstallerContract (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\INHibernateInstallerContract.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,NHibernateFacility,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\NHibernateFacility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,Data,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\NHibernateFacility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Instance' Config' Factory
Deficient Encapsulation,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,Data,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\NHibernateFacility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance' Config' Factory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,INHibernateInstaller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\INHibernateInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Facilities.NHibernate.INHibernateInstaller' Castle.Facilities.NHibernate.INHibernateInstallerContract
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,ISessionManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\ISessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Facilities.NHibernate.ISessionManager' Castle.Facilities.NHibernate.ISessionManagerContract
Cyclic Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,INHibernateInstaller,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\INHibernateInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: INHibernateInstallerContract
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,INHibernateInstallerContract,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\INHibernateInstallerContract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Deserialize
Cyclic Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.NHibernate,ISessionManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\haf_Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\src\Castle.Facilities.NHibernate\ISessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ISessionManagerContract
