Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,PCRemote.UI,CustomCommands,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\CustomCommands.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InsertCommand which is more interested in members of the type: ICommandRepository
Duplicate Abstraction,PCRemote.UI.Properties,Resources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Resources (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs' [1' 24])' Resource (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resource.Designer.cs' [1' 24])
Duplicate Abstraction,PCRemote.UI.Properties,Resources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Resources (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs' [43' 62])' Resource (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resource.Designer.cs' [43' 62])
Unutilized Abstraction,PCRemote.UI.Properties,Resource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Resource.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,PCRemote.UI,Main,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WorkingFolder
Insufficient Modularization,PCRemote.UI,Main,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Modularization,PCRemote.UI.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.UI\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' Username' Password' LastID' AutomaticStart' AccessToken' AccessTokenSecret' WeiboType' EmailAccountName' EmailAccountPassword' SendPhotoByEmail' SmtpServer' SmtpPort' MyEmailAddress' DownloadPath' AutoClear' IdsToClear' defaultInstance
