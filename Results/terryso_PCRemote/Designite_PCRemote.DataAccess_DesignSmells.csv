Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PCRemote.DataAccess,sqlite_sequence,C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Classes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PCRemote.DataAccess,sqlite_sequence,C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Classes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  sqlite_sequence (C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Classes.cs' [62' 90])' sqlite_sequence (C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Classes.cs' [141' 169])
Unutilized Abstraction,PCRemote.DataAccess,sqlite_sequenceTable,C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Structs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PCRemote.DataAccess,CommandsTable,C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Structs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,PCRemote.DataAccess,PCRemoteDB,C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DataProvider' provider
Insufficient Modularization,PCRemote.DataAccess,PCRemoteDB,C:\repos\terryso_PCRemote\PCRemote.DataAccess\Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
