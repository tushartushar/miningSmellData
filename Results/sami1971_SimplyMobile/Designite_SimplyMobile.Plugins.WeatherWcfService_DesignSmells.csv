Unnecessary Abstraction,SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService,IWeatherForecastServiceChannel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sami1971_SimplyMobile\Core\Plugins\Weather\SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService\WeatherForecastService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Multifaceted Abstraction,SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService,WeatherForecastServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sami1971_SimplyMobile\Core\Plugins\Weather\SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService\WeatherForecastService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Unutilized Abstraction,SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService,WeatherClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sami1971_SimplyMobile\Core\Plugins\Weather\SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService\WeatherClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService,DefaultFaultContract,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sami1971_SimplyMobile\Core\Plugins\Weather\SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService\WeatherForecastService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ErrorId' ErrorMessage' CorrelationId' ErrorIdField' ErrorMessageField' CorrelationIdField
Broken Modularization,SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService,Weather,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sami1971_SimplyMobile\Core\Plugins\Weather\SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService\WeatherForecastService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Location' Time' Wind' Visibility' SkyConditions' Temperature' DewPoint' RelativeHumidity' Pressure' LocationField' TimeField' WindField' VisibilityField' SkyConditionsField' TemperatureField' DewPointField' RelativeHumidityField' PressureField
Insufficient Modularization,SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService,WeatherForecastServiceClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sami1971_SimplyMobile\Core\Plugins\Weather\SimplyMobile.Plugins.WeatherWcfService\WeatherForecastService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
