(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NCron.Fluent.Reflection,Extensions,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\Fluent\Reflection\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NCron.Fluent.Crontab,Extensions,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\Fluent\Crontab\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,NCron.Service,Bootstrap,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\Service\Bootstrap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Init
Unutilized Abstraction,NCron.Service,Bootstrap,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\Service\Bootstrap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NCron.Service,ServiceProcessAdapter,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\Service\ServiceProcessAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,NCron,SystemTime,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\SystemTime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Resolver
Deficient Encapsulation,NCron,SystemTime,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\SystemTime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Resolver
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NCron,CronContext,C:\repos\schourode_ncron\src\NCron\CronContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: NCron.CronContext' NCron.ICronJob
