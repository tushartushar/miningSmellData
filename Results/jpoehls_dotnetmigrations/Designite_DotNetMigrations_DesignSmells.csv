Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetMigrations.Commands,ConnectionsCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jpoehls_dotnetmigrations\src\DotNetMigrations\Commands\ConnectionsCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetMigrations.Commands,ConnectionsCommandArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jpoehls_dotnetmigrations\src\DotNetMigrations\Commands\ConnectionsCommandArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Action' Name' ConnectionString

Feature Envy,DotNetMigrations,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jpoehls_dotnetmigrations\src\DotNetMigrations\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WriteShortErrorMessages which is more interested in members of the type: LogRepository
