(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Probe.Common.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' RootPath' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Probe.Common,Constants,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RaceColors
Deficient Encapsulation,Probe.Common,Constants,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RaceColors
Deficient Encapsulation,Probe.Common,SimpleLog,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\SimpleLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LogFilePath
Deficient Encapsulation,Probe.Common,SimpleLog,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\SimpleLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LogFilePath
Broken Modularization,Probe.Common,Constants,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UINotificationIconHideTime' BoostNotification' BoostEnergy' TerranStandardFirstMuleTime' ZergStandardQueenTime' ZergQueenBuildTime' RaceColors
Insufficient Modularization,Probe.Common,WinApiWrap,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\WinApiWrap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Probe.Common,WinApiWrap,C:\repos\Metaflow_sc2drill-client\Common\WinApiWrap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
