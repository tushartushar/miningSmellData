Unutilized Abstraction,Harvester.Forms,CheckedButtonRenderer,C:\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\CheckedButtonRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Harvester,Rectangle,C:\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Deficient Encapsulation,Harvester,Rectangle,C:\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Left' Top' Right' Bottom
