Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Harvester.Forms,SystemEventControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\SystemEventControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Harvester.Forms,DoubleBufferedListView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\DoubleBufferedListView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Harvester.Forms,Main,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Render
Feature Envy,Harvester.Forms,Main,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WireUpSystemEvents which is more interested in members of the type: DoubleBufferedListView
Unnecessary Abstraction,Harvester,Rectangle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Deficient Encapsulation,Harvester,Rectangle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Insufficient Modularization,Harvester.Forms,Main,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Modularization,Harvester.Properties,SystemEventProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Properties\SystemEventProperties.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' PrimaryBackColor' FatalBackColor' FatalForeColor' ErrorBackColor' ErrorForeColor' WarningBackColor' WarningForeColor' InformationBackColor' InformationForeColor' DebugBackColor' DebugForeColor' TraceBackColor' TraceForeColor' Font' IdWidth' TimestampWidth' LevelWidth' ProcessIdWidth' ProcessNameWidth' ThreadWidth' SourceWidth' UserWidth' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,Harvester.Properties,ShellProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Properties\ShellProperties.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' WindowLocation' WindowSize' WindowState' SplitPosition' defaultInstance
Unfactored Hierarchy,Harvester.Forms,FilterByApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FilterByApplication (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs' [1' 25])' FilterByProcessId (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByProcessId.cs' [1' 25])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Harvester.Forms,FilterByApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FilterByApplication (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs' [4' 25])' FilterByText (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByText.cs' [3' 24])' FilterByProcessId (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByProcessId.cs' [4' 25])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Harvester.Forms,FilterByApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FilterByApplication (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs' [5' 25])' FilterByLevel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByLevel.cs' [3' 23])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Harvester.Forms,FilterByApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FilterByApplication (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByApplication.cs' [5' 24])' FilterByLevel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByLevel.cs' [3' 22])' FilterByProcessId (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByProcessId.cs' [5' 24])' FilterByText (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByText.cs' [4' 23])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Harvester.Forms,FilterByLevel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cbaxter_Harvester\src\Windows\Forms\FilterByLevel.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
