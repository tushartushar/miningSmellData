Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Node.Net,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BufferSize' TraceLogging
Unnecessary Abstraction,Node.Net,Callback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name' callback' args
Deficient Encapsulation,Node.Net,commonjs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\commonjs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RequireStack
Deficient Encapsulation,Node.Net,commonjs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\commonjs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RequireStack
Deficient Encapsulation,Node.Net,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: instance' Listeners
Deficient Encapsulation,Node.Net,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: instance
Deficient Encapsulation,Node.Net,Callback,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name' callback' args
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Node.Net,NetServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\netserver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Node.Net.NetServer' Node.Net.net' Node.Net.Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Node.Net,EventEmitter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\EventEmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Node.Net.EventEmitter' Node.Net.NetServer' Node.Net.net' Node.Net.Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Node.Net,NetStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\NetStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Node.Net.NetStream' Node.Net.NetServer' Node.Net.net' Node.Net.Server
Broken Hierarchy,Node.Net,NetServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dnewcome_Node.net\IronJS\netserver.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Node.Net.EventEmitter
