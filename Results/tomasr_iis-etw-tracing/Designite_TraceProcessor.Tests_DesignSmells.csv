Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,TraceProcessor.Tests,BatchTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomasr_iis-etw-tracing\Collector\TraceProcessor.Tests\BatchTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unfactored Hierarchy,TraceProcessor.Tests,FlatJsonConverterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomasr_iis-etw-tracing\Collector\TraceProcessor.Tests\FlatJsonConverterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FlatJsonConverterTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomasr_iis-etw-tracing\Collector\TraceProcessor.Tests\FlatJsonConverterTests.cs' [40' 63])' ComplexJsonConverterTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomasr_iis-etw-tracing\Collector\TraceProcessor.Tests\ComplexJsonConverterTests.cs' [43' 66])
Rebellious Hierarchy,TraceProcessor.Tests,CountingProcessor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tomasr_iis-etw-tracing\Collector\TraceProcessor.Tests\TraceSourceProcessorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetNotify
