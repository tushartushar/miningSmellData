Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow,SubscriptionOption<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\SubscriptionOption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubscriptionName' BatchSize' QueuePrefetchSize' RouteFinder' MessageHandler
Imperative Abstraction,Burrow.Internal,HaConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Internal\HaConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Connect
Duplicate Abstraction,Burrow.Internal,ConsumerErrorHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Internal\ConsumerErrorHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConsumerErrorHandler (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Internal\ConsumerErrorHandler.cs' [154' 173])' ConsumerManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Internal\ConsumerManager.cs' [84' 103])
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow,Global,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultSerializer' DefaultWatcher' DefaultCorrelationIdGenerator' DefaultTypeNameSerializer' DefaultTaskCreationOptionsProvider' DefaultConsumerBatchSize' PreFetchSize' DefaultPersistentMode' DefaultErrorQueueName' DefaultErrorExchangeName' ConsumerDisposeTimeoutInSeconds
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow,Global,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultSerializer' DefaultWatcher' DefaultCorrelationIdGenerator' DefaultTypeNameSerializer' DefaultTaskCreationOptionsProvider' DefaultConsumerBatchSize' PreFetchSize' DefaultPersistentMode' DefaultErrorQueueName' DefaultErrorExchangeName' ConsumerDisposeTimeoutInSeconds
Broken Modularization,Burrow,AsyncSubscriptionOption<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\AsyncSubscriptionOption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubscriptionName' BatchSize' QueuePrefetchSize' RouteFinder' MessageHandler
Insufficient Modularization,Burrow,RabbitTunnel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\RabbitTunnel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Broken Modularization,Burrow,SubscriptionOption<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\SubscriptionOption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
