Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow,Global,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultSerializer' DefaultWatcher' DefaultCorrelationIdGenerator' DefaultTypeNameSerializer' DefaultTaskCreationOptionsProvider' DefaultConsumerBatchSize' PreFetchSize' DefaultPersistentMode' DefaultErrorQueueName' DefaultErrorExchangeName' ConsumerDisposeTimeoutInSeconds
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow,Global,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DefaultSerializer' DefaultWatcher' DefaultCorrelationIdGenerator' DefaultTypeNameSerializer' DefaultTaskCreationOptionsProvider' DefaultConsumerBatchSize' PreFetchSize' DefaultPersistentMode' DefaultErrorQueueName' DefaultErrorExchangeName' ConsumerDisposeTimeoutInSeconds
Broken Modularization,Burrow,AsyncSubscriptionOption,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\AsyncSubscriptionOption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubscriptionName' BatchSize' QueuePrefetchSize' RouteFinder' MessageHandler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Burrow,Global,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Global.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Global' DefaultTaskCreationOptionProvider
Insufficient Modularization,Burrow,RabbitTunnel,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\RabbitTunnel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Burrow,RabbitTunnel,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\RabbitTunnel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RabbitTunnel' TunnelFactory
Broken Modularization,Burrow,SubscriptionOption,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\SubscriptionOption.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubscriptionName' BatchSize' QueuePrefetchSize' RouteFinder' MessageHandler
Broken Modularization,Burrow.Internal,BurrowError,D:\newReposJune17\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow\Internal\BurrowError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
