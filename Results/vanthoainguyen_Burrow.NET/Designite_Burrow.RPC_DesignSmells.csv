Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,AsyncAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\AsyncAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,Burrow.RPC,BurrowRpcClientCoordinator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\BurrowRpcClientCoordinator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Init which is more interested in members of the type: IRpcRouteFinder
Unutilized Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,ExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,IRpcRouteFinder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\IRpcRouteFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CreateExchangeAndQueue' RequestExchangeName' RequestExchangeType' RequestQueue' UniqueResponseQueue
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,InternalDependencies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\InternalDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MethodMatcher' RpcQueueHelper
Unutilized Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,RpcFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\RpcFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,RpcResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\RpcResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exception' RequestId' ReturnValue' ChangedParams
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow.RPC,InternalDependencies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\InternalDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MethodMatcher' RpcQueueHelper
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow.RPC,InternalDependencies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\InternalDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MethodMatcher' RpcQueueHelper
Broken Modularization,Burrow.RPC,IRpcRouteFinder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\IRpcRouteFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CreateExchangeAndQueue' RequestExchangeName' RequestExchangeType' RequestQueue' UniqueResponseQueue
Rebellious Hierarchy,Burrow.RPC,RpcRouteFinderAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\RpcRouteFinderAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FindRoutingKey
