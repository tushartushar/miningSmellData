Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,AsyncAttribute,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\AsyncAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,IRpcRouteFinder,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\IRpcRouteFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CreateExchangeAndQueue' RequestExchangeName' RequestExchangeType' RequestQueue' UniqueResponseQueue
Unutilized Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,DefaultFanoutRpcRequestRouteFinder<T>,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\DefaultFanoutRpcRequestRouteFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,InternalDependencies,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\InternalDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MethodMatcher' RpcQueueHelper
Unnecessary Abstraction,Burrow.RPC,RpcResponse,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\RpcResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exception' RequestId' ReturnValue' ChangedParams
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow.RPC,InternalDependencies,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\InternalDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MethodMatcher' RpcQueueHelper
Deficient Encapsulation,Burrow.RPC,InternalDependencies,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\InternalDependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MethodMatcher' RpcQueueHelper
Broken Modularization,Burrow.RPC,IRpcRouteFinder,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\IRpcRouteFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CreateExchangeAndQueue' RequestExchangeName' RequestExchangeType' RequestQueue' UniqueResponseQueue
Rebellious Hierarchy,Burrow.RPC,RpcRouteFinderAdapter,C:\repos\vanthoainguyen_Burrow.NET\src\Burrow.RPC\RpcRouteFinderAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FindRoutingKey
