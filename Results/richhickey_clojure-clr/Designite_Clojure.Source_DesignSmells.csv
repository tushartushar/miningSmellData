Unutilized Abstraction,dm,PetTypeAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\attributes\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dm,C1,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\genclass\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,dm,C1,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\genclass\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: dm.C1' dm.interop.C1

Unutilized Abstraction,dm.interop,C1,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dm.interop,C2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dm.interop,C3,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unnecessary Abstraction,dm.interop,C4,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dm.interop,C5,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dm.interop,C6,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Deficient Encapsulation,dm.interop,C1,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m1' m1s
Deficient Encapsulation,dm.interop,C1,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\richhickey_clojure-clr\Clojure\Clojure.Source\clojure\samples\interop\C.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: m1s
