Multifaceted Abstraction,PrettyJunction,JunctionPoint,C:\repos\xiaoyifang_PrettyJunction\PrettyJunction\JunctionPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Unnecessary Abstraction,PrettyJunction,VariableNode,C:\repos\xiaoyifang_PrettyJunction\PrettyJunction\VariableNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' Index' Exclude
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\repos\xiaoyifang_PrettyJunction\PrettyJunction\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\repos\xiaoyifang_PrettyJunction\PrettyJunction\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionSet' OptionContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,NDesk.Options,OptionValueCollection,C:\repos\xiaoyifang_PrettyJunction\PrettyJunction\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OptionValueCollection' OptionContext' Option' OptionContext
