Duplicate Abstraction,AdamsLair.WinForms.TestApp,DemoForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DemoForm (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs' [314' 342])' DemoForm (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs' [350' 378])
Unnecessary Abstraction,AdamsLair.WinForms.TestApp,ISomeInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InterfaceInt

Deficient Encapsulation,AdamsLair.WinForms.TestApp,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: stringListField' enumField1' enumField2' typeField
Deficient Encapsulation,AdamsLair.WinForms.TestApp,Test2,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: testBool
Insufficient Modularization,AdamsLair.WinForms.TestApp,DemoForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Modularization,AdamsLair.WinForms.TestApp,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AdamsLair_winforms\TestApp\DemoForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
