Duplicate Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Chords,ChordBoxImage,C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\ChordBoxImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ChordBoxImage (C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\ChordBoxImage.cs' [1' 20])' ChordHandler (C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\ChordHandler.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Chords,Bar,C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\ChordBoxImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Str' Pos' Length' Finger
Unutilized Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Chords,ChordHandler,C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\ChordHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Chords,RedirectModule,C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\RedirectModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,EinarEgilsson.Chords,Bar,C:\repos\einaregilsson_ChordImageGenerator\ChordBoxImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Str' Pos' Length' Finger
