Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,WarpEngine,ShipInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BobPalmer_WarpDrive\Source\WarpEngine\WarpEngine\ShipInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ShipPart' BreakingForce' BreakingTorque' CrashTolerance' Constraints
Unutilized Abstraction,WarpEngine,USI_ModuleWarpEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BobPalmer_WarpDrive\Source\WarpEngine\WarpEngine\USI_ModuleWarpEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,WarpEngine,USI_ModuleWarpEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BobPalmer_WarpDrive\Source\WarpEngine\WarpEngine\USI_ModuleWarpEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: status' deployAnimationName' unfoldAnimationName' warpAnimationName' WarpFactor' Demasting' MaxAccelleration' MinThrottle' IsDeployed' DisruptRange' BubbleSize' MinAltitude' GravFactor' BrakeFalloff' minMaxSpeed' TurboPoint' TurboFactor' TurboMult' ConservationMode
Broken Modularization,WarpEngine,ShipInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BobPalmer_WarpDrive\Source\WarpEngine\WarpEngine\ShipInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ShipPart' BreakingForce' BreakingTorque' CrashTolerance' Constraints
