Duplicate Abstraction,Common,AdbOperator,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\AdbOperator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AdbOperator[123' 150]' AdbOperator[241' 268]
Duplicate Abstraction,Common,AdbOperator,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\AdbOperator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AdbOperator[152' 173]' AdbOperator[270' 291]
Duplicate Abstraction,Common,AdbOperator,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\AdbOperator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AdbOperator[415' 452]' AdbOperator[524' 561]' AdbOperator[634' 671]' AdbOperator[744' 781]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Common,CodeType,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\CodeType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TYPE_SN' TYPE_IMEI' TYPE_WIFI_MAC' TYPE_BT_MAC' TYPE_SW_VERSION
Unutilized Abstraction,Common,IMessageHandler,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\IMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Common,DeviceDetector,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\DeviceDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: pid' vid' mi
Deficient Encapsulation,Common,DeviceDetector,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\DeviceDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: pid' vid' mi
Insufficient Modularization,Common,AdbOperator,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\AdbOperator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 140
Broken Modularization,Common,CodeType,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\CodeType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TYPE_SN' TYPE_IMEI' TYPE_WIFI_MAC' TYPE_BT_MAC' TYPE_SW_VERSION
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Common,WMIUsbQuery,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\WMIUsbQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WMIUsbQuery' DeviceDetector
Broken Modularization,Common,Messages,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\Common\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MSG_WRITE_START' MSG_WRITE_STATE_CHANGE' MSG_WRITE_SUCCESS' MSG_WRITE_FAIL' MSG_READ_START' MSG_READ_STATE_CHANGE' MSG_READ_SUCCESS' MSG_READ_FAIL' MSG_UPDATE_DEVICE_COUNT
