Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,IMEI_Reader,Printer,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\IMEI_Reader\Printer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: HandleMessge
Duplicate Abstraction,IMEI_Reader,Settings,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\IMEI_Reader\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: IMEI_Reader.Settings' IMEI_Reader.Properties.Settings
Imperative Abstraction,IMEI_Reader,Writer,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\IMEI_Reader\Writer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: HandleMessge
Unnecessary Abstraction,IMEI_Reader.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\IMEI_Reader\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,IMEI_Reader,Printer,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\IMEI_Reader\Printer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 110
Broken Modularization,IMEI_Reader,Settings,C:\repos\linshixiong_EmdoorBarcodeTools\IMEI_Reader\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' Printer' PrintSpeed' Vertical' Offset' Sensor' B_Type' B_Readable' B_Rotation' B_Narrow' B_Wide' T_F' T_S' T_R' T_L' LabelWidth' PrintDensity' B_Height' T_X' T_Y' T_H' Gap1' Gap2' LabelGap' LabelColumn' LabelHeight' SN_Selected' IMEI_Selected' WIFI_Selected' BT_Selected' Sw_Version_Selected' Auto_Read' PrintCount' AutoPrint' InputSNType' InputIMEIType' InputWIFIType' InputBTType' WriteSNChecked' WriteIMEIChecked' WriteWIFIChecked' WriteBTChecked' USB_VID' USB_PID' USB_MI' defaultInstance
