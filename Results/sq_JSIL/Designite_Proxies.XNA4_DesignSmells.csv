Unutilized Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies,RectangleProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies,MatrixProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies,VectorProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies,ColorProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies,UnsafeNativeMethodsProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\UnsafeNativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Unutilized Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies.XNA,IndexBufferProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNA4\Buffers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,JSIL.Proxies.XNA,Texture2DProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNA4\Texture2D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,JSIL.Proxies,ColorProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: r' g' b' a
Insufficient Modularization,JSIL.Proxies,MatrixProxy,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Proxies\XNACommon\Primitives.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
