Duplicate Abstraction,JSIL.System,NumberFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NumberFormatter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs' [1732' 1751])' NumberFormatter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs' [1792' 1811])
Duplicate Abstraction,JSIL.System,NumberFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NumberFormatter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs' [1953' 1974])' NumberFormatter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs' [1981' 2002])
Deficient Encapsulation,JSIL.System,CustomInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UseGroup' DecimalDigits' DecimalPointPos' DecimalTailSharpDigits' IntegerDigits' IntegerHeadSharpDigits' IntegerHeadPos' UseExponent' ExponentDigits' ExponentTailSharpDigits' ExponentNegativeSignOnly' DividePlaces' Percents' Permilles
Insufficient Modularization,JSIL.System,NumberFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 79 methods
Insufficient Modularization,JSIL.System,NumberFormatter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\JSIL.mscorlib\JSIL\System\NumberFormatter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 331
