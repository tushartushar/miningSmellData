Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Mono.Linker,AnnotationStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\Compiler\Analyzers\DeadCodeAnalyzer\Annotations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AnnotationStore (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\Compiler\Analyzers\DeadCodeAnalyzer\Annotations.cs' [8' 31])' TypeMapStep (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\Compiler\Analyzers\DeadCodeAnalyzer\TypeMapStep.cs' [8' 31])
Feature Envy,Mono.Linker.Steps,TypeMapStep,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\Compiler\Analyzers\DeadCodeAnalyzer\TypeMapStep.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AnnotateMethods which is more interested in members of the type: AnnotationStore
Insufficient Modularization,JSIL.Compiler.Extensibility.DeadCodeAnalyzer,DeadCodeInfoProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sq_JSIL\Compiler\Analyzers\DeadCodeAnalyzer\DeadCodeInfoProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 177
