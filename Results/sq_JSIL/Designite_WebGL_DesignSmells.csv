Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,WebGL,Page,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebGL,AttributeCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' VertexPosition' VertexNormal' TextureCoord
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebGL,BufferCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CubeVertexPositions' CubeVertexNormals' CubeTextureCoords' CubeIndices
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebGL,MatrixCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Projection' ModelView' Normal
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebGL,CubeData,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Positions' Normals' TexCoords' Indices
Deficient Encapsulation,WebGL,Page,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GL' Document' Canvas' GLVector3' GLMatrix3' GLMatrix4' ShaderProgram' CrateTexture' HeldKeys' LastTime' Z' RotationX' RotationY' SpeedX' SpeedY
Deficient Encapsulation,WebGL,Page,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: GL' Document' Canvas' GLVector3' GLMatrix3' GLMatrix4' ShaderProgram' CrateTexture' HeldKeys' LastTime' Z' RotationX' RotationY' SpeedX' SpeedY
Deficient Encapsulation,WebGL,AttributeCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VertexPosition' VertexNormal' TextureCoord
Deficient Encapsulation,WebGL,UniformCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ProjectionMatrix' ModelViewMatrix' NormalMatrix' Sampler' UseLighting' AmbientColor' LightingDirection' DirectionalColor
Deficient Encapsulation,WebGL,BufferCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CubeVertexPositions' CubeVertexNormals' CubeTextureCoords' CubeIndices
Deficient Encapsulation,WebGL,MatrixCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Projection' ModelView' Normal
Broken Modularization,WebGL,UniformCollection,C:\repos\sq_JSIL\Examples\WebGL\Page.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ProjectionMatrix' ModelViewMatrix' NormalMatrix' Sampler' UseLighting' AmbientColor' LightingDirection' DirectionalColor
