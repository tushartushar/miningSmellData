Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,igtasks,Functions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Ultilities\igtasks\Functions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Functions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Ultilities\igtasks\Functions.cs' [1' 20])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Ultilities\igtasks\Program.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,igtasks.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Ultilities\igtasks\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,adtasks,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Ultilities\igtasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: args
Deficient Encapsulation,adtasks,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Ultilities\igtasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: args
