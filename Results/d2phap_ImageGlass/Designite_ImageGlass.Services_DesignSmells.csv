Unnecessary Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services.InstanceManagement,ArgumentsReceivedEventArgs,C:\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\InstanceManagement\ArgumentsReceivedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Args
Duplicate Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services,Update,C:\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Update.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Update (C:\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Update.cs' [1' 20])' InfoUpdate (C:\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\InfoUpdate.cs' [1' 20])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageGlass.Services.Configuration,ConfigurationFile,C:\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Configuration\ConfigurationFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageGlass.Services.Configuration.ConfigurationFile' ImageGlass.Services.Configuration.GlobalSetting
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageGlass.Services.Configuration,GlobalSetting,C:\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Configuration\GlobalSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageGlass.Services.Configuration.GlobalSetting' ImageGlass.Services.Configuration.ConfigurationFile
