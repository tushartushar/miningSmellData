Unutilized Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services,Update,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Update.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services,Update,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Update.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Update (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Update.cs' [1' 20])' InfoUpdate (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\InfoUpdate.cs' [1' 20])
Feature Envy,ImageGlass.Services,Update,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Update.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadUpdateConfig which is more interested in members of the type: InfoUpdate
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services.InstanceManagement,ArgumentsReceivedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\InstanceManagement\ArgumentsReceivedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Args
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services.InstanceManagement,NativeMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\InstanceManagement\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageGlass.Services.InstanceManagement,SingleInstance,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\InstanceManagement\SingleInstance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ImageGlass.Services.Configuration,GlobalSetting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Configuration\GlobalSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageGlass.Services.Configuration,ConfigurationFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Services\Configuration\ConfigurationFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageGlass.Services.Configuration.ConfigurationFile' ImageGlass.Services.Configuration.GlobalSetting
