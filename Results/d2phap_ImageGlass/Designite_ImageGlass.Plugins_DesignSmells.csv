Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,ImageGlass.Plugins,IPlugin,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IPlugin[1' 22]' PluginManager[1' 22]
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageGlass.Plugins,PluginManager,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Types,AvailablePlugins,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Types,AvailablePlugin,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Instance' AssemblyPath' myInstance' myAssemblyPath
Unutilized Abstraction,Types,AvailablePlugin,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,ImageGlass.Plugins,PluginManager,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Plugins
Deficient Encapsulation,ImageGlass.Plugins,PluginManager,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Plugins
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageGlass.Plugins,IPlugin,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IPlugin' IPluginHost
Rebellious Hierarchy,ImageGlass.Plugins,PluginServices,F:\newReposMay17\d2phap_ImageGlass\Source\Components\ImageGlass.Plugins\PluginServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Feedback
