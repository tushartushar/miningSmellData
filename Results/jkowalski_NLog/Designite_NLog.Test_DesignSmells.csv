Unutilized Abstraction,NLog.Test,ExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jkowalski_NLog\tests\NLog.Test\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
