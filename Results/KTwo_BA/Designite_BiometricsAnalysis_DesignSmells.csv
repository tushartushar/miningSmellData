Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,BiometricsAnalysis,BCM,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\BCM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Unnecessary Abstraction,BiometricsAnalysis,App,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Multifaceted Abstraction,BiometricsAnalysis,MainWindow,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Unnecessary Abstraction,BiometricsAnalysis.Signature,puncte,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\Signature\SignatureModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' x' y
Unnecessary Abstraction,BiometricsAnalysis.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,BiometricsAnalysis.Signature,puncte,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\Signature\SignatureModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: x' y
Deficient Encapsulation,BiometricsAnalysis.Signature,SignatureModule,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\Signature\SignatureModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: points1' points2' rasp3' file1_text' file2_text' output' output3
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BiometricsAnalysis,Login,C:\repos\KTwo_BA\biometricsanalysis\BiometricsAnalysis\Login.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Login' MainWindow
