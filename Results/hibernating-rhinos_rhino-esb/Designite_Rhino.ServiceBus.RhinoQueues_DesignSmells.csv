Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues,ErrorCounter,C:\repos\hibernating-rhinos_rhino-esb\Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues\RhinoQueues\ErrorAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ExceptionText' FailureCount
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues,RhinoQueueCurrentMessageInformation,C:\repos\hibernating-rhinos_rhino-esb\Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues\RhinoQueues\RhinoQueueCurrentMessageInformation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ListenUri' Queue' TransportMessage
Deficient Encapsulation,Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues,ErrorCounter,C:\repos\hibernating-rhinos_rhino-esb\Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues\RhinoQueues\ErrorAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ExceptionText' FailureCount
Missing Hierarchy,Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues,RhinoQueuesMessageBuilder,C:\repos\hibernating-rhinos_rhino-esb\Rhino.ServiceBus.RhinoQueues\RhinoQueues\RhinoQueuesMessageBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: AdministrativeMessage' LoadBalancerMessage (in method "GetAppSpecificMarker" of class "RhinoQueuesMessageBuilder").
