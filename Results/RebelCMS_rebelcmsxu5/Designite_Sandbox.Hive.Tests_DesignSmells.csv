Imperative Abstraction,Sandbox.Hive.Tests,MappingRepositoryTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RebelCMS_rebelcmsxu5\Sandboxes\Hive\Sandbox.Hive.Tests\MappingRepositoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MyTestInitialize

Feature Envy,Sandbox.Hive.Tests,PersistenceRepositoryTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RebelCMS_rebelcmsxu5\Sandboxes\Hive\Sandbox.Hive.Tests\PersistenceRepositoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetTest which is more interested in members of the type: IPersistenceRepository
Feature Envy,Sandbox.Hive.Tests,PersistenceRepositoryTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\RebelCMS_rebelcmsxu5\Sandboxes\Hive\Sandbox.Hive.Tests\PersistenceRepositoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddTest which is more interested in members of the type: IPersistenceRepository
