Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.05  All the dependencies among components: from: MultiMiner.Blockchain' to: MultiMiner.Utility.Net' from: MultiMiner.Blockchain' to: MultiMiner.Blockchain.Data' from:
