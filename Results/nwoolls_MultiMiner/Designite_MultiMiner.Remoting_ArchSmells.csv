Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,MultiMiner.Remoting,MultiMiner.Remoting.Broadcast,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MultiMiner.Remoting,MultiMiner.Remoting.Broadcast.Config
Feature Concentration,MultiMiner.Remoting,MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Application]' [TimerInterval]' [CoinSuggestionsAlgorithm]' [Device]' [Engine]' [Path]' [Perks]' [Xgminer]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.TimerInterval' MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.CoinSuggestionsAlgorithm' MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.Device' MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.Engine' MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.Path' MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.Perks' MultiMiner.Remoting.Data.Transfer.Configuration.Xgminer
