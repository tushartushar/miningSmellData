Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,MultiMiner.UX,MultiMiner.UX.Data.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MultiMiner.Engine.Data.Configuration' MultiMiner.Engine
Unstable Dependency,MultiMiner.UX,MultiMiner.UX.ViewModels,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): MultiMiner.NiceHash' MultiMiner.Services
Feature Concentration,MultiMiner.UX,MultiMiner.UX.Data,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
