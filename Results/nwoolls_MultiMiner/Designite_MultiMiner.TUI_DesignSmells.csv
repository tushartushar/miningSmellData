Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,MultiMiner.TUI.Commands,DeviceCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.TUI\Commands\DeviceCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleCommand which is more interested in members of the type: ApplicationViewModel
Imperative Abstraction,MultiMiner.TUI.Commands,NetworkCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.TUI\Commands\NetworkCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: HandleCommand
Feature Envy,MultiMiner.TUI.Commands,NetworkCommand,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.TUI\Commands\NetworkCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.
