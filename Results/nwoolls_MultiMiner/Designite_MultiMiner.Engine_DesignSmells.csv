Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine,CoinSuggestions,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\CoinSuggestions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetCoinsToMine
Unnecessary Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine.Data,PoolGroup,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\PoolGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Kind' Name' Algorithm
Unnecessary Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine.Data,AvailableMiner,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\AvailableMiner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Version' Url
Unnecessary Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine.Data,MinerDescriptor,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\MinerDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FileName' LegacyApi
Unnecessary Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine.Data.Configuration,ProxyDescriptor,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\Configuration\Xgminer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GetworkPort' StratumPort
Unutilized Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine.Extensions,StringExtensions,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Extensions\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MultiMiner.Engine.Helpers,DonationPools,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Helpers\DonationPools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Seed
Broken Modularization,MultiMiner.Engine,LogProcessCloseArgs,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\LogProcessCloseArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartDate' EndDate' CoinName' CoinSymbol' StartPrice' EndPrice' AcceptedShares' DeviceDescriptors' MinerConfiguration
Insufficient Modularization,MultiMiner.Engine,MiningEngine,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\MiningEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MultiMiner.Engine,MiningEngine,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\MiningEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
Broken Modularization,MultiMiner.Engine.Data,AlgorithmParameter,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\AlgorithmParameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Scrypt' ScryptJane' AlgorithmScryptNFactor11' AlgorithmQuarkcoin' AlgorithmGroestlcoin' AlgorithmKeccak' AlgorithmX11' AlgorithmX13' AlgorithmX14' AlgorithmX15' AlgorithmNeoScrypt' AlgorithmLyra2RE
Broken Modularization,MultiMiner.Engine.Data,KnownCoins,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\KnownCoins.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BitcoinSymbol' BitcoinName' LitecoinSymbol' LitecoinName' DogecoinSymbol' BadDogecoinSymbol
Broken Modularization,MultiMiner.Engine.Data,MinerNames,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\MinerNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BFGMiner' CGMiner' SGMiner' SGMiner5' SPHSGMiner' KalrothSJCGMiner' LBSPHSGMiner' AZNSGMiner' MaxcoinCGMiner
Broken Hierarchy,MultiMiner.Engine.Data.Configuration,Device,C:\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Engine\Data\Configuration\Device.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MultiMiner.Xgminer.Data.DeviceDescriptor
