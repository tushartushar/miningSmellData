Unutilized Abstraction,MultiMiner.Discovery.Tests,BroadcasterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Discovery.Tests\BroadcasterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,MultiMiner.Discovery.Tests,BroadcasterTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Discovery.Tests\BroadcasterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Broadcaster_BroadcastVerb_SendsUdpPacket which is more interested in members of the type: Listener
Unnecessary Abstraction,MultiMiner.Discovery.Tests,ListenerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nwoolls_MultiMiner\MultiMiner.Discovery.Tests\ListenerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
