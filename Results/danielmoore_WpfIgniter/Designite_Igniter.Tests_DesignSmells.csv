Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,BindableBaseTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\BindableBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Igniter.Tests,BindableBaseTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\BindableBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CanSubscribeToPropertyChanged which is more interested in members of the type: TestBindableType
Unnecessary Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,ITestInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\BindableBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MyInterfaceValue
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,ExpressionCommandTestFixture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,TestSubViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value4' Value5' _value4' _value5' Value6
Unnecessary Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,TestDependencyObjectViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value7' Value7Property
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,ExpressionUtilTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionUtilTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,DerivedObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionUtilTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PropB' PropC
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Tests,NotifyPropertyChangedExtensionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\NotifyPropertyChangedExtensionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Tests.Core,WeakEventTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\Core\WeakEventTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Igniter.Tests,TestSubViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value6
Deficient Encapsulation,Igniter.Tests,BaseObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionUtilTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FieldA
Broken Modularization,Igniter.Tests,TestBindableType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\BindableBaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MyValue' MyInterfaceValue' MyValue' _myValue' _myInterfaceValue' _myValue
Broken Modularization,Igniter.Tests,TestSubViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter.Tests\ExpressionCommandTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value4' Value5' _value4' _value5' Value6
