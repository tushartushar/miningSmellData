List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SwitchElement (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Controls\SwitchElement.cs' [180' 217])' ViewElement (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\ViewElement.cs' [340' 377])
Imperative Abstraction,Igniter.Markup,RootViewModelBindingExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Markup\RootViewModelBindingExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProvideValue
Unutilized Abstraction,Igniter.Markup,RootViewModelBindingExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Markup\RootViewModelBindingExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Igniter.Behaviors,SwitchBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Behaviors\SwitchBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Igniter.Behaviors.SwitchBehavior' Igniter.Behaviors.SwitchBehaviorCase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Igniter.Composition,CreationStrategy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\CreationStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Igniter.Composition.CreationStrategy' Igniter.Composition.ViewFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Igniter.Composition,IViewFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\IViewFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Igniter.Composition.IViewFactory' Igniter.Composition.ViewFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Igniter.Composition,ViewElement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\ViewElement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Igniter.Composition.ViewElement' Igniter.Composition.ViewFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Igniter.Composition,CreationStrategy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\CreationStrategy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Igniter.Composition.CreationStrategy' Igniter.Composition.IViewFactory' Igniter.Composition.ViewFactory
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Igniter.Composition,ViewElement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\ViewElement.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Igniter.Composition.ViewElement' Igniter.Composition.ViewFactory' Igniter.Composition.CreationStrategy
Unfactored Hierarchy,Igniter,DelegateCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\DelegateCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DelegateCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\DelegateCommand.cs' [55' 76])' ExpressionCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\ExpressionCommand.cs' [82' 103])
Broken Hierarchy,Igniter.Core,ExpressionCommandBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Core\ExpressionCommandBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Igniter.Core.CommandBase' Igniter.IDisposableCommand
Cyclic Hierarchy,Igniter.Composition,IViewFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danielmoore_WpfIgniter\Igniter\Composition\IViewFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ViewFactory
