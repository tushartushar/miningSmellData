Imperative Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,IOCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\IOCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoCheck
Unnecessary Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,DriveMetric,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\IOCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Counter' MetricName' Divisor
Unnecessary Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,Drive,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\IOCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InstanceName' DriveName' Metrics
Unutilized Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,PerformanceCounterBasedCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\PerformanceCounterBasedCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,SQLServerCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\SQLServerCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoCheck
Imperative Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,ProcessorCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\ProcessorCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoCheck
Imperative Abstraction,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,SystemStatsCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\SystemStatsCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoCheck
Deficient Encapsulation,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent,Agent,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Agent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Flags
Deficient Encapsulation,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent,Agent,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Agent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Flags
Broken Modularization,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent,AgentConfigurationSection,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\AgentConfigurationSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ServerDensityUrl' AgentKey' DebugMode' CheckInterval' IISStatus' PluginDirectory' SqlServerConnectionString' MongoDBConnectionString' MongoDBDBStats' MongoDBReplSet' SQLServerStatus' CustomPrefix' EventViewer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,PerformanceCounterBasedProcessCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\PerformanceCounterBasedProcessCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks.PerformanceCounterBasedProcessCheck' BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks.ProcessCheck
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,ProcessCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\ProcessCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks.ProcessCheck' BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks.PerformanceCounterBasedProcessCheck
Cyclic Hierarchy,BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent.Checks,ProcessCheck,C:\repos\serverdensity_sd-agent-windows\BoxedIce.ServerDensity.Agent\Checks\ProcessCheck.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PerformanceCounterBasedProcessCheck
