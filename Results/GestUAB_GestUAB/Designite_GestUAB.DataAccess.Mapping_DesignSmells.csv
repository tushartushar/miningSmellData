Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping,ColumnAttributeTypeMapper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GestUAB_GestUAB\src\GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping\CustomMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ColumnAttributeTypeMapper<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GestUAB_GestUAB\src\GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping\CustomMapper.cs' [3' 27])' Config (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GestUAB_GestUAB\src\GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping\Config.cs' [3' 27])
Unnecessary Abstraction,GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping,ColumnMappingAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GestUAB_GestUAB\src\GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping\CustomMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GestUAB_GestUAB\src\GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping,ColumnAttributeTypeMapper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GestUAB_GestUAB\src\GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping\CustomMapper.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GestUAB.DataAccess.Mapping.FallbackTypeMapper
