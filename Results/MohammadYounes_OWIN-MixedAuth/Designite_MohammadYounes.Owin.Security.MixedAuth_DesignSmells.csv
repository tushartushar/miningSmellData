Unutilized Abstraction,Owin,AppBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\AppBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth,MixedAuthConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\MixedAuthConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DefaultAuthenticationType' TempCookieName' FakeStatusCode
Unutilized Abstraction,MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth,MixedAuthExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\MixedAuthExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth,MixedAuthHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\MixedAuthHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: InvokeAsync
Duplicate Abstraction,MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth,IMixedAuthProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\Provider\IMixedAuthProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IMixedAuthProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\Provider\IMixedAuthProvider.cs' [5' 25])' MixedAuthProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\MohammadYounes_OWIN-MixedAuth\src\MohammadYounes.Owin.Security.MixedAuth\Provider\MixedAuthProvider.cs' [5' 25])
