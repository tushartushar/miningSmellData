Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Duplicate Abstraction,BitMiracle.dJpeg,bmp_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  bmp_dest_struct (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs' [229' 256])' bmp_dest_struct (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs' [317' 344])
Feature Envy,BitMiracle.dJpeg,bmp_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: write_colormap which is more interested in members of the type: jpeg_decompress_struct
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.dJpeg,djpeg_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\djpeg_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: output_file' buffer' buffer_height
Broken Hierarchy,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BitMiracle.LibJpeg.Classic.jpeg_progress_mgr
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitMiracle.dJpeg,bmp_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: start_output
