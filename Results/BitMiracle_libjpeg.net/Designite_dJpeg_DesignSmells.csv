Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Duplicate Abstraction,BitMiracle.dJpeg,bmp_dest_struct,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  bmp_dest_struct (C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs' [229' 256])' bmp_dest_struct (C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs' [317' 344])
Imperative Abstraction,BitMiracle.dJpeg,Program,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.dJpeg,djpeg_dest_struct,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\djpeg_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: output_file' buffer' buffer_height
Broken Hierarchy,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BitMiracle.LibJpeg.Classic.jpeg_progress_mgr
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitMiracle.dJpeg,bmp_dest_struct,C:\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\dJpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: start_output
