Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.cJpeg,cjpeg_source_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cJpeg\cjpeg_source_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: input_file' buffer' buffer_height
Broken Hierarchy,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BitMiracle.LibJpeg.Classic.jpeg_progress_mgr
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitMiracle.cJpeg,bmp_source_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cJpeg\bmp_source_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: finish_input
