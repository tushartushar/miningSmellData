Unnecessary Abstraction,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Unutilized Abstraction,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_utils,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BitMiracle.Jpeg,bmp_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  bmp_dest_struct (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs' [229' 256])' bmp_dest_struct (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs' [317' 344])
Feature Envy,BitMiracle.Jpeg,bmp_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: write_colormap which is more interested in members of the type: jpeg_decompress_struct
Unnecessary Abstraction,BitMiracle.Jpeg,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' InputFileName' OutputFileName
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: completed_extra_passes' total_extra_passes
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.Jpeg,cjpeg_source_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\cjpeg_source_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: input_file' buffer' buffer_height
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.Jpeg,djpeg_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\djpeg_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: output_file' buffer' buffer_height
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.Jpeg,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: InputFileName' OutputFileName
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.Jpeg,CompressOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program_Compression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Quality' ForceBaseline' DCTMethod' Debug' Grayscale' Optimize' Progressive' Qslots' Qtables' RestartInterval' RestartInRows' Sample' SmoothingFactor
Deficient Encapsulation,BitMiracle.Jpeg,DecompressOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program_Decompression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OutputFormat' QuantizeColors' DesiredNumberOfColors' DCTMethod' DitherMode' Debug' Fast' Grayscale' NoSmooth' OnePass' Scaled' ScaleNumerator' ScaleDenominator
Insufficient Modularization,BitMiracle.Jpeg,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 133
Broken Modularization,BitMiracle.Jpeg,CompressOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program_Compression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Quality' ForceBaseline' DCTMethod' Debug' Grayscale' Optimize' Progressive' Qslots' Qtables' RestartInterval' RestartInRows' Sample' SmoothingFactor
Broken Modularization,BitMiracle.Jpeg,DecompressOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\Program_Decompression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' OutputFormat' QuantizeColors' DesiredNumberOfColors' DCTMethod' DitherMode' Debug' Fast' Grayscale' NoSmooth' OnePass' Scaled' ScaleNumerator' ScaleDenominator
Broken Hierarchy,BitMiracle.cdJpeg,cdjpeg_progress_mgr,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\cdJpeg\cdjpeg_progress_mgr.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BitMiracle.LibJpeg.Classic.jpeg_progress_mgr
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitMiracle.Jpeg,bmp_dest_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\bmp_dest_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: start_output
Rebellious Hierarchy,BitMiracle.Jpeg,bmp_source_struct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\BitMiracle_libjpeg.net\Jpeg\bmp_source_struct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: finish_input
