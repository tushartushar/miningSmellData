Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,MiNET.Client,ClientUtils,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\ClientUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ClientUtils (C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\ClientUtils.cs' [1' 26])' MiNetClient (C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs' [1' 26])
Deficient Encapsulation,MiNET.Client,MiNetClient,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HaveServer' FirstEncryptedPacketWaitHandle' FirstPacketWaitHandle' PlayerStatusChangedWaitHandle
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MiNET.Client,BotHelpers,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\BotHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MiNET.Client.BotHelpers' MiNET.Client.MiNetClient
Insufficient Modularization,MiNET.Client,MiNetClient,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MiNET.Client,MiNetClient,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 86 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MiNET.Client,MiNetClient,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 191
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MiNET.Client,MiNetClient,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MiNET.Client.MiNetClient' MiNET.Client.BotHelpers
Missing Hierarchy,MiNET.Client,MiNetClient,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Client\MiNetClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: GameRule' GameRule (in method "OnMcpeGameRulesChanged" of class "MiNetClient").
