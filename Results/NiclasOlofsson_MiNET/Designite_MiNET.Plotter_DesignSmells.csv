Unutilized Abstraction,MiNET.Plotter,PlotCommands,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Plotter\PlotCommands.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MiNET.Plotter,PlotManager,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Plotter\PlotManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Rebellious Hierarchy,MiNET.Plotter,PlotWorldGenerator,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.Plotter\PlotWorldGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
