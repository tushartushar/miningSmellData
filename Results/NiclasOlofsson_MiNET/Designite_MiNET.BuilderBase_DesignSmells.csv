Duplicate Abstraction,MiNET.BuilderBase.Masks,BlockDataEntry,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\Masks\Mask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: MiNET.BuilderBase.Masks.BlockDataEntry' MiNET.BuilderBase.Patterns.BlockDataEntry
Unnecessary Abstraction,MiNET.BuilderBase.Patterns,BlockDataEntry,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\Patterns\Pattern.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Metadata' Weight' Accumulated
Unnecessary Abstraction,MiNET.BuilderBase.Tools,BlockBuffer,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\Tools\BrushTool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,MiNET.BuilderBase,RegionSelector,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\RegionSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RegionSelectors
Deficient Encapsulation,MiNET.BuilderBase,RegionSelector,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\RegionSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RegionSelectors
Unexploited Encapsulation,MiNET.BuilderBase.Tools,BrushTool,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\Tools\BrushTool.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Air' Air (in method "ErosionIteration" of class "BrushTool").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MiNET.BuilderBase,EditHelper,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\EditHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MiNET.BuilderBase.EditHelper' MiNET.BuilderBase.RegionSelector
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MiNET.BuilderBase,RegionSelector,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\RegionSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MiNET.BuilderBase.RegionSelector' MiNET.BuilderBase.EditHelper
Rebellious Hierarchy,MiNET.BuilderBase,BuilderBasePlugin,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\BuilderBasePlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnDisable
Broken Hierarchy,MiNET.BuilderBase.Commands,MiscCommands,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\Commands\MiscCommands.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MiNET.BuilderBase.Commands.UndoableCommand
Broken Hierarchy,MiNET.BuilderBase.Commands,SchematicsCommands,C:\repos\NiclasOlofsson_MiNET\src\MiNET\MiNET.BuilderBase\Commands\SchematicsCommands.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MiNET.BuilderBase.Commands.UndoableCommand
