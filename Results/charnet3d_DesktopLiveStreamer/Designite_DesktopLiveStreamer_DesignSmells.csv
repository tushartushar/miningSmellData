Duplicate Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FrmStreams (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs' [581' 619])' FrmStreams (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs' [646' 684])
Duplicate Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FrmStreams (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs' [614' 636])' FrmStreams (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs' [867' 889])
Unutilized Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,ImageDropDownList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\ImageDropDownList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,DesktopLiveStreamer,XMLPersist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\XMLPersist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LiveStreamerExecutable' VLCExecutable' PreferedQuality' DefaultGame' StreamXMLFile' GameXMLFile
Deficient Encapsulation,DesktopLiveStreamer,XMLPersist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\XMLPersist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LiveStreamerExecutable' VLCExecutable' PreferedQuality' DefaultGame' StreamXMLFile' GameXMLFile
Insufficient Modularization,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 164
Missing Hierarchy,DesktopLiveStreamer,GameComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\Game.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Game' Game (in method "Compare" of class "GameComparer").
Missing Hierarchy,DesktopLiveStreamer,StreamComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\Stream.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Stream' Stream (in method "Compare" of class "StreamComparer").
