Unutilized Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FrmStreams[581' 619]' FrmStreams[646' 684]
Duplicate Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FrmStreams[614' 636]' FrmStreams[867' 889]
Duplicate Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FrmStreams[1609' 1635]' FrmAdd[138' 164]
Unnecessary Abstraction,DesktopLiveStreamer.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,DesktopLiveStreamer,XMLPersist,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\XMLPersist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LiveStreamerExecutable' VLCExecutable' PreferedQuality' DefaultGame' StreamXMLFile' GameXMLFile
Deficient Encapsulation,DesktopLiveStreamer,XMLPersist,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\XMLPersist.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: LiveStreamerExecutable' VLCExecutable' PreferedQuality' DefaultGame' StreamXMLFile' GameXMLFile
Insufficient Modularization,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DesktopLiveStreamer,FrmStreams,F:\newReposMay17\charnet3d_DesktopLiveStreamer\DesktopLiveStreamer\FrmStreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 188
