Imperative Abstraction,Irony.Samples,GWBasicGrammar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevinHoward_Irony\Irony.Samples\GWBasic\GwBasicGrammar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: identifier_ValidateToken
Unutilized Abstraction,Irony.Samples,TableStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevinHoward_Irony\Irony.Samples\Wiki\WikiHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Irony.Samples,FlagTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevinHoward_Irony\Irony.Samples\Wiki\WikiHtmlConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
