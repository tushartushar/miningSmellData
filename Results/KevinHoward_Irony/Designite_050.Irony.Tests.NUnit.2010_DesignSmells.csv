Unutilized Abstraction,Irony.Tests,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevinHoward_Irony\Irony.Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Irony.Tests,NumberLiteralTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\KevinHoward_Irony\Irony.Tests\NumberLiteralTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestCSharpNumber which is more interested in members of the type: Token
