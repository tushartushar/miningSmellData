Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8,GroupDetailPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\GroupDetailPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnDataRequested which is more interested in members of the type: SampleDataGroup
Feature Envy,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8,ItemDetailOwn,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\ItemDetailPage.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnDataRequested which is more interested in members of the type: SampleDataItem
Unutilized Abstraction,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Common,BooleanToVisibilityConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\Common\BooleanToVisibilityConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Common,RichTextColumns,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\Common\RichTextColumns.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data,SampleDataItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\DataModel\SampleDataSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data.SampleDataItem' CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data.SampleDataGroup
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Common,LayoutAwarePage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\Common\LayoutAwarePage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Common.LayoutAwarePage' CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Common.SuspensionManager
Broken Hierarchy,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data,SampleDataItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\DataModel\SampleDataSource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data.SampleDataCommon
Broken Hierarchy,CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data,SampleDataGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AttackPattern_CSharpAnalytics\Source\Samples\CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8\DataModel\SampleDataSource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CSharpAnalytics.Sample.Windows8.Data.SampleDataCommon
