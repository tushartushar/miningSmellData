Imperative Abstraction,Algorithm3.Indices,DenseIntKeyIndex,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Indices\DenseIntKeyIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateExtender
Unutilized Abstraction,Algorithm3.Indices,DenseKeyIndexExtensionMethods,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Indices\DenseKeyIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

This class contains only the following public method: CreateExtender
Unutilized Abstraction,Algorithm3.Indices,EmptyKeyIndexExtensionMethods,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Indices\EmptyKeyIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Algorithm3.Indices,TypedIndexExtensionMethods,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Indices\TypedIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Algorithm3.Indices,TypedKeyIndex,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Indices\TypedIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class.

Deficient Encapsulation,Algorithm3,ExtensionProposal,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Record' Index' Count
Insufficient Modularization,Algorithm3,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\MicrosoftResearch_NaiadSamples\Join\Algorithm3\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
