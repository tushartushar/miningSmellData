Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,OxyColorConverter,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Converters\OxyColorConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,ThicknessConverter,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Converters\ThicknessConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,PhoneRenderContext,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\PhoneRenderContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,Plot,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Plot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,PlotView,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\PlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Imperative Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,TrackerControl,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Tracker\TrackerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnApplyTemplate
Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,TrackerControl,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Tracker\TrackerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,TrackerControl,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Tracker\TrackerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,TrackerDefinition,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Tracker\TrackerDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TrackerKey' TrackerTemplate' TrackerKeyProperty' TrackerTemplateProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WP8,MouseButtonHelper,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Utilities\MouseButtonHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WP8,PlotView,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\PlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WP8,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WP8,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Broken Hierarchy,OxyPlot.WP8,Plot,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WP8\Plot.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PlotView
