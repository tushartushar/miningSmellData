Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,PlotView,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\PlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,NamespaceDoc,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,NamespaceDoc,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\NamespaceDoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,Plot,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Plot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
Broken Hierarchy,OxyPlot.WindowsForms,Plot,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsForms\Plot.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): PlotView
