Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,OxyColorConverter,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Converters\OxyColorConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,ThicknessConverter,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Converters\ThicknessConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,RenderContext,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\RenderContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Multifaceted Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,PlotView,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\PlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,TrackerControl,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Tracker\TrackerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,TrackerDefinition,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Tracker\TrackerDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TrackerKey' TrackerTemplate' TrackerKeyProperty' TrackerTemplateProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,PlotView,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\PlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\andreasjacobsen93_XamarinThirdpartySamples\oxyplot-develop\Source\OxyPlot.WindowsUniversal\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 116
