Unnecessary Abstraction,metrics,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Key' Value
Unnecessary Abstraction,metrics,MedianFunctionLong,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,metrics,MedianFunctionLong,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Deficient Encapsulation,metrics,MultiUserSample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\MultiUserSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UserId' MetricId
Deficient Encapsulation,metrics,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Key' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,metrics,User,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\User.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Guid
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,metrics,MultiUserSample,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\MultiUserSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: metrics.MultiUserSample' metrics.Database
Broken Hierarchy,metrics,MetricSampleModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\extras\metrics\MetaMetrics.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): metrics.SampleModel
