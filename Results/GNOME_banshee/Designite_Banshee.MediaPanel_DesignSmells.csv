Feature Envy,Banshee.MediaPanel,MediaPanelContents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\MediaPanelContents.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnProgrammaticSearch which is more interested in members of the type: SearchEntry
Feature Envy,Banshee.MediaPanel,MediaPanelContents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\MediaPanelContents.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnSearchEntryChanged which is more interested in members of the type: SearchEntry
Feature Envy,Banshee.MediaPanel,MediaPanelContents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\MediaPanelContents.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnActiveSourceChanged which is more interested in members of the type: SearchEntry
Unnecessary Abstraction,Banshee.MediaPanel,SearchFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\SearchEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Field' Title
Imperative Abstraction,Banshee.MediaPanel,HeaderBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\HeaderBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: PackStartHighlighted
Unexploited Encapsulation,Banshee.MediaPanel,MediaPanelService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\MediaPanelService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: InterfaceActionService' GtkElementsService' PlayerEngineService (in method "OnServiceStarted" of class "MediaPanelService").
Deficient Encapsulation,Banshee.MediaPanel,SearchFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\SearchEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Field' Title
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Banshee.MediaPanel,MediaPanelService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.MediaPanel\Banshee.MediaPanel\MediaPanelService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Banshee.MediaPanel.MediaPanelService' Banshee.MediaPanel.MediaPanelContents' Banshee.MediaPanel.MediaPanel
