Deficient Encapsulation,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesImportData,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: library_uri' default_query' local_prefix' fallback_dir' query_dirs' get_ratings' get_stats' get_playlists' user_provided_prefix' empty_library' total_songs' total_processed' track_ids
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Banshee.PlayerMigration.ItunesPlayerImportSource' Banshee.PlayerMigration.ItunesImportDialog
Broken Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesImportData,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' library_uri' default_query' local_prefix' fallback_dir' query_dirs' get_ratings' get_stats' get_playlists' user_provided_prefix' empty_library' total_songs' total_processed' track_ids
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesImportDialog,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportDialogs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Banshee.PlayerMigration.ItunesImportDialog' Banshee.PlayerMigration.ItunesPlayerImportSource
