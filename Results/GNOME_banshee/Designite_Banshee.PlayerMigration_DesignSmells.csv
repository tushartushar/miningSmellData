Feature Envy,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleImportDialog which is more interested in members of the type: ItunesImportData
Feature Envy,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CountSongs which is more interested in members of the type: ItunesImportData

Deficient Encapsulation,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesImportData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: library_uri' default_query' local_prefix' fallback_dir' query_dirs' get_ratings' get_stats' get_playlists' user_provided_prefix' empty_library' total_songs' total_processed' track_ids
Insufficient Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 126
Broken Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesImportData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' library_uri' default_query' local_prefix' fallback_dir' query_dirs' get_ratings' get_stats' get_playlists' user_provided_prefix' empty_library' total_songs' total_processed' track_ids
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Banshee.PlayerMigration.ItunesPlayerImportSource' Banshee.PlayerMigration.ItunesImportDialog
