Duplicate Abstraction,Banshee.PlayerMigration,AmarokPlayerImportSource,F:\newReposMay17\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\AmarokPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AmarokPlayerImportSource[9' 31]' RhythmboxPlayerImportSource[10' 32]' ItunesImportDialog[8' 30]

Insufficient Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,F:\newReposMay17\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 212
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Banshee.PlayerMigration,ItunesPlayerImportSource,F:\newReposMay17\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.PlayerMigration\Banshee.PlayerMigration\ItunesPlayerImportSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ItunesPlayerImportSource' ItunesImportDialog
