Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Banshee.Sample,SampleSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Sample\Banshee.Sample\SampleSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SampleSource (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Sample\Banshee.Sample\SampleSource.cs' [3' 29])' SampleSourceInterface (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Sample\Banshee.Sample\SampleSourceInterface.cs' [3' 29])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Banshee.Sample,SampleSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Sample\Banshee.Sample\SampleSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Banshee.Sample.SampleSource' Banshee.Sample.SampleSourceInterface
Broken Hierarchy,Banshee.Sample,SampleSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Sample\Banshee.Sample\SampleSource.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Banshee.Sources.Source
Rebellious Hierarchy,Banshee.Sample,SampleSourceInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Sample\Banshee.Sample\SampleSourceInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResetSource
