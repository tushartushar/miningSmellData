Feature Envy,Banshee.Mpris,MprisService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Mpris\Banshee.Mpris\MprisService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnPlayerEvent which is more interested in members of the type: MediaPlayer

Unnecessary Abstraction,Banshee.Mpris,Playlist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Mpris\Banshee.Mpris\IPlaylists.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Name' Icon
Unnecessary Abstraction,Banshee.Mpris,MaybePlaylist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Mpris\Banshee.Mpris\IPlaylists.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Valid' Playlist
Deficient Encapsulation,Banshee.Mpris,Playlist,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Mpris\Banshee.Mpris\IPlaylists.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.

Insufficient Modularization,Banshee.Mpris,MediaPlayer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Extensions\Banshee.Mpris\Banshee.Mpris\MediaPlayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
