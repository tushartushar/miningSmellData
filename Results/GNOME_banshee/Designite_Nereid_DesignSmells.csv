Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Nereid,PlayerInterface,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PlayerInterface (C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs' [9' 30])' ViewContainer (C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\ViewContainer.cs' [8' 29])' Client (C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\Client.cs' [8' 29])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Nereid,SearchFilter,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\ViewContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Id' Field' Title
Deficient Encapsulation,Nereid,SearchFilter,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\ViewContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id' Field' Title
Multipath Hierarchy,Nereid,PlayerInterface,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IService
Missing Hierarchy,Nereid,PlayerInterface,C:\repos\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ITrackModelSource' ITrackModelSourceContents (in method "UpdateSourceContents" of class "PlayerInterface").
