Duplicate Abstraction,Nereid,PlayerInterface,F:\newReposMay17\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PlayerInterface[9' 30]' ViewContainer[8' 29]' Client[8' 29]
Multipath Hierarchy,Nereid,PlayerInterface,F:\newReposMay17\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IService
Missing Hierarchy,Nereid,PlayerInterface,F:\newReposMay17\GNOME_banshee\src\Clients\Nereid\Nereid\PlayerInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ITrackModelSource' ITrackModelSourceContents (in method "UpdateSourceContents" of class "PlayerInterface").
