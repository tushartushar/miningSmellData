Unnecessary Abstraction,PixelLab.Contracts,PureAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\Contract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,PixelLab.Contracts,ContractInvariantMethodAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\Contract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,PixelLab.Common,WeakNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\WeakEnumerable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Next
Insufficient Modularization,PixelLab.Common,CollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\CollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PixelLab.Common,ListBase<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\ListBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PixelLab.Common.ListBase<T>' PixelLab.Common.ListBaseContract<T>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PixelLab.Common,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\Util.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PixelLab.Common.Util' PixelLab.Contracts.Contract
Wide Hierarchy,PixelLab.Common,Changeable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\Changeable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: PixelLab.Wpf.ZapCommandItem' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.TreeViewDataItem' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.FolderPicker.LocalDrives' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.FolderPicker.SelectableDirectory' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.Hex.HexBoard' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.Hex.HexPiece' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.MineSweeper.MineField' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.MineSweeper.Square' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.OrgTree.OrgItem' PixelLab.Wpf.Demo.Set.SetGame' PixelLab.Common.FilteredObservableEnumerable<TItem'TSource>' PixelLab.Common.SortedObservableEnumerable<TItem'TSource>
Unfactored Hierarchy,PixelLab.Common,FilteredObservableEnumerable<TItem;TSource>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\FilteredObservableEnumerable.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  FilteredObservableEnumerable<TItem'TSource> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\FilteredObservableEnumerable.cs' [57' 77])' SortedObservableEnumerable<TItem'TSource> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\thinkpixellab_bot\net40-client\Core\SortedObservableEnumerable.cs' [45' 65])
