Unutilized Abstraction,OpenXmlUtils,Spreadsheet,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\Spreadsheet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenXmlUtils,FormulaCell,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\FormulaCell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: FormulaCell[5' 26]' NumberCell[5' 26]' TextCell[5' 26]
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenXmlUtils,DecimalNumberField,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\SpreadsheetField Types\DecimalNumberField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DecimalPlaces
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenXmlUtils,DecimalNumberField,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\SpreadsheetField Types\DecimalNumberField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DecimalNumberField[1' 24]' HyperlinkField[1' 24]' SpreadsheetField[1' 24]
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenXmlUtils,HyperlinkField,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\SpreadsheetField Types\HyperlinkField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DisplayFieldName
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenXmlUtils,SpreadsheetField,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\SpreadsheetField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Title' FieldName' IgnoreFromTotals' CountNoneNullRowsForTotal
Unexloited Encapsulation,OpenXmlUtils,Spreadsheet,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\Spreadsheet.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: HyperlinkField' DecimalNumberField (in method "CreateTable" of class "Spreadsheet").
Broken Modularization,OpenXmlUtils,SheetDefinition,C:\repos\geoplex_openxmlutils\OpenXmlUtils\SheetDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Title' SubTitle' Objects' Fields' IncludeTotalsRow
