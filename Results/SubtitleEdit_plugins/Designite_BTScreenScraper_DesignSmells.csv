Imperative Abstraction,WebViewTranslate.Logic,JsonParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\TinyJsonParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Duplicate Abstraction,WebViewTranslate.Logic,Utilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Utilities (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Utilities.cs' [325' 345])' Utilities (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Utilities.cs' [447' 467])
Unutilized Abstraction,WebViewTranslate.Translator,ITranslator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Translator\ITranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BTScreenScraper.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,WebViewTranslate.Logic,Configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentFrameRate' ListViewLineSeparatorString
Deficient Encapsulation,WebViewTranslate.Logic,Configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CurrentFrameRate' ListViewLineSeparatorString
Insufficient Modularization,WebViewTranslate.Logic,HtmlUtil,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\HtmlUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 156
Insufficient Modularization,WebViewTranslate.Logic,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,WebViewTranslate.Logic,Utilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebViewTranslate.Logic,HtmlUtil,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\HtmlUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebViewTranslate.Logic.HtmlUtil' WebViewTranslate.Logic.Utilities
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebViewTranslate.Logic,Subtitle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SubtitleEdit_plugins\BTScreenScraper\DLL\Logic\Subtitle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebViewTranslate.Logic.Subtitle' WebViewTranslate.Logic.SubtitleFormat
