Unnecessary Abstraction,Records,Cons,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Cons.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Records,Cons,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Cons.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Records,Nothing<A>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Records,Tree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Tree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Records,Tree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Tree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Records,Maybe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Records.Maybe' Records.Just<A>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Records,Nothing<A>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Records.Nothing<A>' Records.Maybe
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Records,Just<A>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Records.Just<A>' Records.Maybe' Records.Nothing<A>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Records,Maybe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Just<A>
Cyclic Hierarchy,Records,Maybe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\Records\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Nothing<A>
