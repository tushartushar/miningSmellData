Unnecessary Abstraction,RecordsNetCore,Nothing<A>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\RecordsNetCore\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RecordsNetCore,Maybe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\RecordsNetCore\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RecordsNetCore.Maybe' RecordsNetCore.Just<A>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RecordsNetCore,Nothing<A>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\RecordsNetCore\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RecordsNetCore.Nothing<A>' RecordsNetCore.Maybe
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RecordsNetCore,Just<A>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\RecordsNetCore\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RecordsNetCore.Just<A>' RecordsNetCore.Maybe' RecordsNetCore.Nothing<A>
Cyclic Hierarchy,RecordsNetCore,Maybe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\RecordsNetCore\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Just<A>
Cyclic Hierarchy,RecordsNetCore,Maybe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\louthy_language-ext\Samples\RecordsNetCore\Maybe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Nothing<A>
