Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
God Component,Castle.Zmq,Castle.Zmq,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 30,Castle.Zmq.MonitorEvents,Castle.Zmq.Context' Castle.Zmq.ContextExtensions' Castle.Zmq.MsgFrame' Castle.Zmq.LogAdapter' Castle.Zmq.MonitorEvents' Castle.Zmq.MonitorEventArgs' Castle.Zmq.Monitor' Castle.Zmq.MonitoredSocket' Castle.Zmq.Native' Castle.Zmq.Device' Castle.Zmq.zmq_event_t' Castle.Zmq.MarshalExt' Castle.Zmq.Poll' Castle.Zmq.zmq_pollitem_t_x86' Castle.Zmq.zmq_pollitem_t_x64' Castle.Zmq.Socket' Castle.Zmq.IZmqContext' Castle.Zmq.IZmqSocket' Castle.Zmq.ZmqError' Castle.Zmq.ZmqErrorCode' Castle.Zmq.PollingEvents' Castle.Zmq.Polling' Castle.Zmq.PollItem' Castle.Zmq.RecvFlags' Castle.Zmq.SendFlags' Castle.Zmq.SocketType' Castle.Zmq.Transport' Castle.Zmq.SocketOpt' Castle.Zmq.SocketExtensions' Castle.Zmq.ZmqException
Feature Concentration,Castle.Zmq,Castle.Zmq.Extensions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BasePublisher<T>]' [BaseRequest<T>' RequestPoll' EndpointPoll]' [BaseSubscriber<T>]' [Device' Forwarder' SharedQueue' WorkerPool]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44,Castle.Zmq.Extensions.BaseRequest<T>' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.RequestPoll' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.EndpointPoll' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.BasePublisher<T>' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.BaseSubscriber<T>,Castle.Zmq.Extensions.BasePublisher<T>' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.BaseRequest<T>' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.BaseSubscriber<T>' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.Device' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.Forwarder' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.RequestPoll' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.EndpointPoll' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.SharedQueue' Castle.Zmq.Extensions.WorkerPool
