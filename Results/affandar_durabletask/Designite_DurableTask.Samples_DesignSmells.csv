Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' To' ToAddress' Subject' Body
Unutilized Abstraction,DurableTask.Samples.Common.WorkItems,EmailTask,C:\repos\affandar_durabletask\samples\DurableTask.Samples\Common.WorkItems\EmailTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DurableTask.Samples,OrchestrationConsoleTraceListener,C:\repos\affandar_durabletask\samples\DurableTask.Samples\OrchestrationConsoleTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
