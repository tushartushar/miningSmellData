Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,TestApplication.Common,TestApplication.Common.Orchestrations,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: TestApplication.Common.Orchestrations' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks,TestApplication.Common.Orchestrations.OrchestrationRunningIntoRetry' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.TestTasks,TestApplication.Common.Orchestrations.OrchestrationRunningIntoRetry' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.TestTasks
Unstable Dependency,TestApplication.Common,TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): TestApplication.Common.Orchestrations,TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.CounterException,TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.CounterException
Scattered Functionality,TestApplication.Common,TestApplication.Common.Orchestrations,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: DurableTask.Core' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks,DurableTask.Core.OrchestrationContext' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.ITestTasks' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.IUserTasks,DurableTask.Core.OrchestrationContext' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.ITestTasks' TestApplication.Common.OrchestrationTasks.IUserTasks
