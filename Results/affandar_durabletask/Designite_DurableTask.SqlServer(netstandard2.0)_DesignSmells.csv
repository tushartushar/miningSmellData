Broken Modularization,DurableTask.SqlServer.Tracking,SqlServerInstanceStoreSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\affandar_durabletask\src\DurableTask.SqlServer\Tracking\SqlServerInstanceStoreSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HubName' SchemaName' OrchestrationStateTableName' WorkItemTableName' GetDatabaseConnection' OrchestrationTable' WorkitemTable
Rebellious Hierarchy,DurableTask.SqlServer.Tracking,SqlServerInstanceStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\affandar_durabletask\src\DurableTask.SqlServer\Tracking\SqlServerInstanceStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DeleteJumpStartEntitiesAsync' GetJumpStartEntitiesAsync' WriteJumpStartEntitiesAsync
