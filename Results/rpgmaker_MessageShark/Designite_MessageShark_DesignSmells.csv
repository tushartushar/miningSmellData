Unnecessary Abstraction,MessageShark,MessageSharkIgnoreAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\MessageSharkIgnoreAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MessageShark,MessageSharkIgnoreAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\MessageSharkIgnoreAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MessageShark,MessageSharkIncludeAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\MessageSharkIncludeAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MessageShark,MessageSharkSerializer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\MessageSharkSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,MessageShark,CustomBinary,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\CustomBinary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 62 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,MessageShark,CustomBinary,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\CustomBinary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 112 methods
Insufficient Modularization,MessageShark,CustomBinary,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark\CustomBinary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 350
