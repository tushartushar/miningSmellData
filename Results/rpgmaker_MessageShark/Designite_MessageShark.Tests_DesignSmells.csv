Unnecessary Abstraction,MessageShark.Tests,Test,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Str' Int' UUID

Unutilized Abstraction,MessageShark.Tests,NonGenericSerializationTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\NonGenericSerializationTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MessageShark.Tests,NonGenericSerializationTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\NonGenericSerializationTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NonGenericSerializationTest (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\NonGenericSerializationTest.cs' [14' 55])' ConcurrencyTest (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\ConcurrencyTest.cs' [19' 60])' StreamSerializationTest (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\StreamSerializationTest.cs' [15' 56])

Broken Modularization,MessageShark.Tests,Field,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\FieldClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ID' Name' Description' DataType' Length' _name
Insufficient Modularization,MessageShark.Tests,FieldCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\rpgmaker_MessageShark\src\MessageShark\MessageShark.Tests\FieldClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
