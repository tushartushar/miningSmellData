Insufficient Modularization,DevChallenge.Connection,Abstract,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_devchallenge\DevChallenge\Connection\Abstract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DevChallenge.Connection,Abstract,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_devchallenge\DevChallenge\Connection\Abstract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,DevChallenge.Connection,Abstract,C:\repos\MicaelBelin_devchallenge\DevChallenge\Connection\Abstract.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Close
