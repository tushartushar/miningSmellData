Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters,Factory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sitecore_experience-extractor\src\ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb\Filters\MongoDateRangeFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters.Factory' ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Factory
Unutilized Abstraction,ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb,Helpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sitecore_experience-extractor\src\ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb,MongoDbVisitAggregationContextSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sitecore_experience-extractor\src\ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb\MongoDbVisitAggregationContextSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters,MongoRandomSampleFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sitecore_experience-extractor\src\ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb\Filters\MongoRandomSampleFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters.MongoRandomSampleFilter' ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters.MongoIdSampler
Rebellious Hierarchy,ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters,MongoDateRangeFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sitecore_experience-extractor\src\ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb\Filters\MongoDateRangeFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdateCursor
Rebellious Hierarchy,ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb.Filters,MongoRandomSampleFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sitecore_experience-extractor\src\ExperienceExtractor.MongoDb\Filters\MongoRandomSampleFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdateCursor
