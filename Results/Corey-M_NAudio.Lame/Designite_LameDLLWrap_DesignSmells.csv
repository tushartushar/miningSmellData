Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,LameDLLWrap,LibMp3Lame,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,LameDLLWrap,LAMEVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: major' minor' alpha' beta' psy_major' psy_minor' psy_alpha' psy_beta
Deficient Encapsulation,LameDLLWrap,mp3data,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: header_parsed' stereo' samplerate' bitrate' mode' mode_ext' framesize' nsamp' totalframes' framenum
Broken Modularization,LameDLLWrap,LAMEVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: features' major' minor' alpha' beta' psy_major' psy_minor' psy_alpha' psy_beta' features_ptr
Broken Modularization,LameDLLWrap,mp3data,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' header_parsed' stereo' samplerate' bitrate' mode' mode_ext' framesize' nsamp' totalframes' framenum
Insufficient Modularization,LameDLLWrap,LibMp3Lame,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LameDLLWrap,LibMp3Lame,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LameDLLWrap,NativeMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 193 methods
Insufficient Modularization,LameDLLWrap,NativeMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Corey-M_NAudio.Lame\LameDLLWrap\LibMp3Lame.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 193
