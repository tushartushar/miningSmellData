(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Web.Http.Properties,SRResources,C:\repos\ASP-NET-MVC_aspnetwebstack\src\System.Web.Http.SignalR\Properties\SRResources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SRResources (C:\repos\ASP-NET-MVC_aspnetwebstack\src\System.Web.Http.SignalR\Properties\SRResources.Designer.cs' [43' 63])' CommonWebApiResources (C:\repos\ASP-NET-MVC_aspnetwebstack\src\Common\CommonWebApiResources.Designer.cs' [57' 77])
