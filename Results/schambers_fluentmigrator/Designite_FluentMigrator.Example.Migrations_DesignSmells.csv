Unutilized Abstraction,FluentMigrator.Example.Migrations,MigrationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\schambers_fluentmigrator\samples\FluentMigrator.Example.Migrations\MigrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
