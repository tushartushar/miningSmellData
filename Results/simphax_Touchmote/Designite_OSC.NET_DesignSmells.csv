Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,OSC.NET,OSCReceiver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCReceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OSC.NET,OSCTransmitter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCTransmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OSC.NET,OSCBundle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OSC.NET.OSCBundle' OSC.NET.OSCPacket
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OSC.NET,OSCMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OSC.NET.OSCMessage' OSC.NET.OSCPacket
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OSC.NET,OSCBundle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OSC.NET.OSCBundle' OSC.NET.OSCPacket' OSC.NET.OSCMessage
Cyclic Hierarchy,OSC.NET,OSCPacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: OSCBundle
Cyclic Hierarchy,OSC.NET,OSCPacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\simphax_Touchmote\OSC.NET\OSCPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: OSCMessage
