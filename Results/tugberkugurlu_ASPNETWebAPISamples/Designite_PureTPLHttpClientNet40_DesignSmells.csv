Imperative Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,TaskHelpers,C:\repos\tugberkugurlu_ASPNETWebAPISamples\PureTPLHttpClientNet40\PureTPLHttpClientNet40\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.1\TaskHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RunSynchronously
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Threading.Tasks,AsyncVoid,C:\repos\tugberkugurlu_ASPNETWebAPISamples\PureTPLHttpClientNet40\PureTPLHttpClientNet40\App_Packages\TaskHelpers.Sources.0.1\TaskHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
