Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,SAZipper,Inputdata,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\SAZipper\Inputdata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Duplicate Abstraction,SAZipper,XCeedPack,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\SAZipper\XCeedPack.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: XCeedPack[984' 1004]' XCeedPack[1159' 1179]
Unnecessary Abstraction,SAZipper.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\SAZipper\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexloited Encapsulation,SAZipper,XCeedPack,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\SAZipper\XCeedPack.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ZippedFile' ZippedFolder (in method "Countnumbers" of class "XCeedPack").
Insufficient Modularization,SAZipper,XCeedPack,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\SAZipper\XCeedPack.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SAZipper,XCeedPack,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\SAZipper\XCeedPack.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 202
