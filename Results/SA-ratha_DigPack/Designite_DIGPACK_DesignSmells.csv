Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Facts
Multifaceted Abstraction,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.93
Duplicate Abstraction,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DIGPACK[384' 407]' DIGPACK[449' 472]
Duplicate Abstraction,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: DIGPACK[1436' 1461]' DIGPACK[1593' 1618]
Deficient Encapsulation,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Pakker' Res' Restext' Totfolders' Totsubfolders' Totfiles' Totsize' BigestfileSize' Stopped' facts' BigFiles' AllFolders
Insufficient Modularization,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DIGPACK,DIGPACK,C:\repos\SA-ratha_DigPack\DIGPACK\DIGPACK\DIGPACK_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 199
