Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,CardinalityEstimation,BiasCorrection,D:\newReposJune17\Microsoft_CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimation\BiasCorrection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BiasCorrection[1' 28]' CardinalityEstimator[1' 28]' CardinalityEstimatorSerializer[1' 28]' CardinalityEstimatorState[1' 28]' Fnv1A[1' 28]' HashFunctionId[1' 28]' HashFunctionFactory[1' 28]' Murmur3[1' 28]

Unutilized Abstraction,CardinalityEstimation,CardinalityEstimatorSerializer,D:\newReposJune17\Microsoft_CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimatorSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,CardinalityEstimation,CardinalityEstimatorState,D:\newReposJune17\Microsoft_CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimatorState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HashFunctionId' BitsPerIndex' DirectCount' IsSparse' LookupDense' LookupSparse' CountAdditions
Broken Modularization,CardinalityEstimation,CardinalityEstimatorState,D:\newReposJune17\Microsoft_CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimation\CardinalityEstimatorState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HashFunctionId' BitsPerIndex' DirectCount' IsSparse' LookupDense' LookupSparse' CountAdditions
