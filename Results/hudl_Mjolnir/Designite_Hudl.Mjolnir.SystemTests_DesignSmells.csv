Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests,ChartSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\_archive\Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests\ChartSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Description' Charts
Imperative Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\_archive\Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RunAllScenarios
Unutilized Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\_archive\Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests,IHttpClientService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\_archive\Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests\IHttpClientService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests.IHttpClientService' Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests.HttpClientService
Cyclic Hierarchy,Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests,IHttpClientService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\_archive\Hudl.Mjolnir.SystemTests\IHttpClientService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: HttpClientService
