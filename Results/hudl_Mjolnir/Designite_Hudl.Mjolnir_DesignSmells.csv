Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Breaker,CircuitBreakerRejectedException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Breaker\CircuitBreakerRejectedException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Bulkhead,BulkheadRejectedException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Bulkhead\BulkheadRejectedException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Command,BaseCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BaseCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DetermineTimeout
Duplicate Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Command,IBreakerInvoker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BreakerInvoker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IBreakerInvoker (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BreakerInvoker.cs' [51' 89])' IBreakerInvoker (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BreakerInvoker.cs' [109' 147])
Duplicate Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Command,IBulkheadInvoker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BulkheadInvoker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IBulkheadInvoker (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BulkheadInvoker.cs' [46' 70])' IBulkheadInvoker (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\BulkheadInvoker.cs' [95' 119])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Config,CommandConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Config\CommandConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Timeout
Unutilized Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Config,MjolnirConfigurationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Config\MjolnirConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Metrics,MaxMetric,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Metrics\MaxMetric.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Hudl.Mjolnir.Util,ConcurrentDictionaryExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Util\ConcurrentDictionaryExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Hudl.Mjolnir.Config,BreakerConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Config\BreakerConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: WindowMillis' MinimumOperations' ThresholdPercentage' TrippedDurationMillis' ForceTripped' ForceFixed' SnapshotTtlMillis
Missing Hierarchy,Hudl.Mjolnir.Command,CommandInvoker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hudl_Mjolnir\src\Hudl.Mjolnir\Command\CommandInvoker.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CircuitBreakerRejectedException' BulkheadRejectedException (in method "GetCompletionStatus" of class "CommandInvoker").
