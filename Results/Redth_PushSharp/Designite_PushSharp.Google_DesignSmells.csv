Unnecessary Abstraction,PushSharp.Google,GcmMessageResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Google\GcmMessageResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MessageId' CanonicalRegistrationId' ResponseStatus' Error
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Google,GcmServiceBroker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Google\GcmServiceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
