Unnecessary Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,ApnsServerNotification,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\Servers\TestApnsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DeviceToken' Payload' Identifier' Expiration' Priority
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,ApnsTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\ApnsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,AdmRealTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\AdmRealTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,GcmRealTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\GcmRealTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,BrokerTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\BrokerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,ApnsRealTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\ApnsRealTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,WnsRealTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\WnsRealTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,WnsRealTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\WnsRealTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  WnsRealTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\WnsRealTests.cs' [14' 33])' WnsRealTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\WnsRealTests.cs' [57' 76])
Unutilized Abstraction,PushSharp.Tests,GcmTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\GcmTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,PushSharp.Tests,TestNotification,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\TestServiceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TESTID
Deficient Encapsulation,PushSharp.Tests,TestNotification,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\TestServiceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: TESTID
Broken Modularization,PushSharp.Tests,ApnsServerNotification,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Redth_PushSharp\PushSharp.Tests\Servers\TestApnsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DeviceToken' Payload' Identifier' Expiration' Priority
