Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,WebInput,QRCode,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\QRCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: WebInput.QRCode' QRCode4CS.QRCode
Duplicate Abstraction,WebInput,frmWebInput,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\WebInput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: frmWebInput[82' 124]' frmWebInput[475' 517]
Imperative Abstraction,QRCode4CS,QRRSBlock,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\QRCode4CS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetRSBlocks
Multifaceted Abstraction,QRCode4CS,QRCode,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\QRCode4CS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebInput.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,WebInput,frmWebInput,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\WebInput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: listener
Deficient Encapsulation,WebInput,frmWebInput,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\WebInput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: listener
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebInput,QRCode,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\QRCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QRCode' frmWebInput
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QRCode4CS,QRUtil,C:\repos\c0nfused_Web-Remote-Input\WebInput\QRCode4CS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QRUtil' QRCode
