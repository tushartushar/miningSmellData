Unutilized Abstraction,RustFlakes,IdExtensions,C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\IdExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,RustFlakes,DecimalOxidation,C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\DecimalOxidation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DecimalOxidation (C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\DecimalOxidation.cs' [1' 21])' Oxidation<T> (C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\Oxidation.cs' [1' 21])' UInt64Oxidation (C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\UInt64Oxidation.cs' [1' 21])
Unutilized Abstraction,RustFlakes,Oxidation<T>,C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\Oxidation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,RustFlakes,SqlServerBigIntOxidation,C:\repos\peschkaj_rustflakes\RustFlakes\SqlServerBigIntOxidation.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RustFlakes.UInt64Oxidation
