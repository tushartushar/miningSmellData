Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Baconography.NeutralServices.KitaroDB,Thumbnails,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\kitarodb\Thumbnails.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Baconography.NeutralServices.KitaroDB,Thumbnails,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\kitarodb\Thumbnails.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Baconography.NeutralServices,OfflineService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\OfflineService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OfflineService (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\OfflineService.cs' [462' 485])' OfflineService (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\OfflineService.cs' [499' 522])
Unutilized Abstraction,BaconographyW8.Common,Flyout,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\Common\Flyout.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,BaconographyW8.PlatformServices,UserService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\UserService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoginWithCredentials which is more interested in members of the type: IRedditService
Unnecessary Abstraction,Baconography.PlatformServices.ImageAPI,Deviantart,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\ImageAPI\Deviantart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Baconography.PlatformServices.ImageAPI,Deviantart,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\ImageAPI\Deviantart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Baconography.PlatformServices.ImageAPI,Picsarus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\ImageAPI\Picsarus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Baconography.NeutralServices,OfflineService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\OfflineService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Baconography.NeutralServices,OfflineService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\OfflineService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Baconography.NeutralServices,OfflineService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\neutralservices\OfflineService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 111
Rebellious Hierarchy,BaconographyW8.PlatformServices,ImagesService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\ImagesService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: IsImage' IsImageAPI
Rebellious Hierarchy,BaconographyW8.PlatformServices,LiveTileService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\LiveTileService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetCount' SetMessageRead' GetMessagesMarkedRead' LoadTaskSettings' StoreTaskSettings
Rebellious Hierarchy,BaconographyW8.PlatformServices,NavigationService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\NavigationService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RemoveBackEntry
Rebellious Hierarchy,BaconographyW8.PlatformServices,SimpleHttpService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\SimpleHttpService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UnAuthedGet
Rebellious Hierarchy,BaconographyW8.PlatformServices,SystemServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Synergex_Baconography\BaconographyW8Core\PlatformServices\SystemServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StartThreadPoolTimer
