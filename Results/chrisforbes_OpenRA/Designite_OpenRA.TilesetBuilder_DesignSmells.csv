Feature Envy,OpenRA.TilesetBuilder,frmBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisforbes_OpenRA\OpenRA.TilesetBuilder\frmBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ShowOverlaysClicked which is more interested in members of the type: Surface
