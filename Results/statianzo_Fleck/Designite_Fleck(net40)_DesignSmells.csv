Unutilized Abstraction,Fleck,IntExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\IntExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Fleck.Handlers,ComposableHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\Handlers\ComposableHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck,FleckLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\FleckLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Level' LogAction
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck,FleckLog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\FleckLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Level' LogAction
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck,WebSocketStatusCodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\WebSocketStatusCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ValidCloseCodes
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck,WebSocketStatusCodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\WebSocketStatusCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ValidCloseCodes
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck.Handlers,ComposableHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\Handlers\ComposableHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Handshake' TextFrame' BinaryFrame' ReceiveData' PingFrame' PongFrame' CloseFrame
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck.Handlers,FlashSocketPolicyRequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\Handlers\FlashSocketPolicyRequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PolicyResponse
Deficient Encapsulation,Fleck.Handlers,FlashSocketPolicyRequestHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\Handlers\FlashSocketPolicyRequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: PolicyResponse
Broken Modularization,Fleck,IWebSocketConnectionInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\Interfaces\IWebSocketConnectionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubProtocol' Origin' Host' Path' ClientIpAddress' ClientPort' Cookies' Headers' Id' NegotiatedSubProtocol
Broken Modularization,Fleck,WebSocketHttpRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\WebSocketHttpRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Method' Path' Body' Scheme' Bytes' Headers' SubProtocols' _headers
Broken Modularization,Fleck,WebSocketStatusCodes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\WebSocketStatusCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NormalClosure' GoingAway' ProtocolError' UnsupportedDataType' NoStatusReceived' AbnormalClosure' InvalidFramePayloadData' PolicyViolation' MessageTooBig' MandatoryExt' InternalServerError' TLSHandshake' ApplicationError' ValidCloseCodes
Rebellious Hierarchy,Fleck,QueuedStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\QueuedStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write
Missing Hierarchy,Fleck,WebSocketConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\statianzo_Fleck\src\Fleck\WebSocketConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: WebSocketException' SubProtocolNegotiationFailureException (in method "HandleReadError" of class "WebSocketConnection").
