Unnecessary Abstraction,Sledge.Shell.Components,RecentFile,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Components\RecentFilesMenuItemProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Location
Unutilized Abstraction,Sledge.Shell,ControlExtensions,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\ControlExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Sledge.Shell.Controls,TextSidebarPanel,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Controls\TextSidebarPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: IsInContext
Imperative Abstraction,Sledge.Shell.Controls,SidebarPanel,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Controls\SidebarPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: AddControl
Unutilized Abstraction,Sledge.Shell.Settings.Editors,EnumValue,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Settings\Editors\EnumEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Sledge.Shell.Registers,ActivatorProvider,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Registers\CommandRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sledge.Shell.Forms,BaseForm,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Forms\BaseForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sledge.Shell.Forms.BaseForm' Sledge.Shell.Registers.HotkeyRegister
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sledge.Shell.Forms,CommandBox,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Forms\CommandBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sledge.Shell.Forms.CommandBox' Sledge.Shell.Forms.CommandItem
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sledge.Shell.Forms,CommandItem,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Forms\CommandBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sledge.Shell.Forms.CommandItem' Sledge.Shell.Forms.CommandBox
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Sledge.Shell.Registers,HotkeyRegister,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Registers\HotkeyRegister.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Sledge.Shell.Registers.HotkeyRegister' Sledge.Shell.Forms.BaseForm
Unfactored Hierarchy,Sledge.Shell.Commands,Export,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Commands\Export.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  Export (C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Commands\Export.cs' [28' 49])' SaveFileAs (C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Commands\SaveFileAs.cs' [30' 51])
Broken Hierarchy,Sledge.Shell.Registers,MenuTreeRoot,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Registers\MenuRegister.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Sledge.Shell.Registers.BaseMenuTreeNode
Broken Hierarchy,Sledge.Shell.Registers,MenuTreeTextNode,C:\repos\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Shell\Registers\MenuRegister.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Sledge.Shell.Registers.BaseMenuTreeNode
