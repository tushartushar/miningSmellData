Unnecessary Abstraction,Sledge.Graphics,Vertex,F:\newReposMay17\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Graphics\Vertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Color' TexCoord' Normal' Position
Unutilized Abstraction,Sledge.Graphics,Vertex,F:\newReposMay17\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Graphics\Vertex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Sledge.Graphics.Helpers,Clear,F:\newReposMay17\LogicAndTrick_sledge\Sledge.Graphics\Helpers\Clear.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
