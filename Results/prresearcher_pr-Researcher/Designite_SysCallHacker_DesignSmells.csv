Unnecessary Abstraction,SysCallHacker.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\prresearcher_pr-Researcher\process-Researcher\ExtraTools\SysCallHacker\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexloited Encapsulation,SysCallHacker,EventProperties,C:\repos\prresearcher_pr-Researcher\process-Researcher\ExtraTools\SysCallHacker\EventProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SsSimple' SsHandle' SsObjectAttributes (in method "EventProperties" of class "EventProperties").
Unexloited Encapsulation,SysCallHacker,EventProperties,C:\repos\prresearcher_pr-Researcher\process-Researcher\ExtraTools\SysCallHacker\EventProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: SsUnicodeString' SsClientId (in method "EventProperties" of class "EventProperties").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SysCallHacker,EventProperties,C:\repos\prresearcher_pr-Researcher\process-Researcher\ExtraTools\SysCallHacker\EventProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EventProperties' MainWindow
