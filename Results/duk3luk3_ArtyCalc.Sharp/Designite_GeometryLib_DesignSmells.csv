Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Geometry.Interpolation,CubicSpline,C:\repos\duk3luk3_ArtyCalc.Sharp\GeometryLib\Interpolation\CubicSpline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CubicSpline[1' 27]' TriDiagonalMatrixF[1' 27]
Unutilized Abstraction,GeometryLib.Math.Fitting,LinearFitting,C:\repos\duk3luk3_ArtyCalc.Sharp\GeometryLib\Math\Fitting\LinearFitting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Geometry.Math.Linear,TriDiagonalMatrixF,C:\repos\duk3luk3_ArtyCalc.Sharp\GeometryLib\Math\TriDiagonalMatrix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: A' B' C
