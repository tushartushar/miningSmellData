Deficient Encapsulation,SharpDX,TextMetric,C:\repos\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\SharpDX.Desktop\Win32Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tmHeight' tmAscent' tmDescent' tmInternalLeading' tmExternalLeading' tmAveCharWidth' tmMaxCharWidth' tmWeight' tmOverhang' tmDigitizedAspectX' tmDigitizedAspectY' tmFirstChar' tmLastChar' tmDefaultChar' tmBreakChar' tmItalic' tmUnderlined' tmStruckOut' tmPitchAndFamily' tmCharSet
Broken Modularization,SharpDX,TextMetric,C:\repos\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\SharpDX.Desktop\Win32Native.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' tmHeight' tmAscent' tmDescent' tmInternalLeading' tmExternalLeading' tmAveCharWidth' tmMaxCharWidth' tmWeight' tmOverhang' tmDigitizedAspectX' tmDigitizedAspectY' tmFirstChar' tmLastChar' tmDefaultChar' tmBreakChar' tmItalic' tmUnderlined' tmStruckOut' tmPitchAndFamily' tmCharSet
