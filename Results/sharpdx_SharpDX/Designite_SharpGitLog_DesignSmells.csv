Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpDX,ConsoleProgram,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConsoleProgram (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs' [1' 21])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Tools\SharpGitLog\Program.cs' [1' 21])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpDX,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpDX,COORD,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpDX,SMALL_RECT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpDX,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpGitLog,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Tools\SharpGitLog\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Label' Directory' OutputFile
Broken Modularization,SharpDX,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Shared\ConsoleProgram.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Broken Hierarchy,SharpGitLog,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sharpdx_SharpDX\Source\Tools\SharpGitLog\Program.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SharpDX.ConsoleProgram
