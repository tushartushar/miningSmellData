Imperative Abstraction,terrain,Terrain,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\Terrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Generate
Unutilized Abstraction,Mono.Game,Vector2,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,terrain,TerrainTile,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\TerrainTile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Biome' Elevation' Moisture' Name' PolygonId' Region' Terrain' TileId' TileObj' X' Y
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Game,Vector2,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Broken Modularization,terrain,MapNode,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\PolygonMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: X' Y' Edges' IsWater' IsOcean' RiverValue' DistanceToCoast
Broken Modularization,terrain,MapPolygon,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\PolygonMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Neighbour' Nodes' DistanceToCoast' CentroidX' CentroidY' IsWater' IsCoast' IsOcean' Polygon
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,terrain,Terrain,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\Terrain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Terrain' Test
Broken Modularization,terrain,TileTypes,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\TileType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DeepWater' Water' MovingWater' Beach' Sand' Grass' BrightGrass' LightGrass' YellowGrass' DarkGrass' BlueGrass' Snow' SnowRock' Rock' Road' id' color' terrainColor
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Game,Vector2,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Game,Vector2,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\terrain\Vector2.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
