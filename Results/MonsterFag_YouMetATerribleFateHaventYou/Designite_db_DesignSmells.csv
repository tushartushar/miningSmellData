Duplicate Abstraction,db,Database,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Database[256' 276]' Database[295' 315]
Imperative Abstraction,db.data,XmlDatas,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\data\XmlDatas.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ReadXmls
Deficient Encapsulation,db.data,XmlDatas,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\data\XmlDatas.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ItemPrices' ItemShops' Keys' ServerXmls
Deficient Encapsulation,db.data,XmlDatas,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\data\XmlDatas.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ItemPrices' ItemShops' Keys' ServerXmls
Insufficient Modularization,db,Database,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,db,Database,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,db,Database,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,db,Database,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Database' MySqlConnection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,db,Database,C:\repos\MonsterFag_YouMetATerribleFateHaventYou\db\Database.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Database' MySqlConnection' MySqlCommand
