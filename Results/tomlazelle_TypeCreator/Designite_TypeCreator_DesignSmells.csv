Unnecessary Abstraction,TypeCreator.AddStrategy,ITypeAction,C:\repos\tomlazelle_TypeCreator\src\TypeCreator\AddStrategy\ITypeAction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AfterCreationDoThis
Unutilized Abstraction,TypeCreator,SetterExtensions,C:\repos\tomlazelle_TypeCreator\src\TypeCreator\SetterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TypeCreator,TypeExtensions,C:\repos\tomlazelle_TypeCreator\src\TypeCreator\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
