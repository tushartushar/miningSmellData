Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Machine.Design,Machine.Design,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Machine.Design' Machine.Design.FreeFormEditing
Unstable Dependency,Machine.Design,Machine.Design.FreeFormEditing,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Machine.Design
Feature Concentration,Machine.Design,Machine.Design.FreeFormEditing,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConnectionPoint' EdgeLocation' ConnectionPointType]' [ConnectionPointConverter]' [ConnectionPointsAdorner' FreeFormPanel' Connector' ConnectorLabelVisibilityConverter' DesignerGeometryHelper' DoubleExtensions' PointExtensions' ConnectorCreationAdorner' ConnectorEditor' ConnectorRouter' ConnectorLabelMarginConverter' ConnectorPointsToSegmentsConverter]' [ConnectorMovedEventArgs]' [ConnectorPointsToArrowMarginConverter]' [ConnectorPointsToArrowTransformConverter]' [ConnectorStartDotConverter]' [LocationChangedEventArgs]' [RequiredSizeChangedEventArgs].
