Duplicate Abstraction,Autolithium.ion,Automation,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\Automation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Automation[1' 32]' Winform[1' 32]
Imperative Abstraction,Autolithium.ion,Mouse,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SendInput
Unutilized Abstraction,Autolithium.ion,Mouse,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Autolithium.ion,INPUT,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Size' type' U
Unnecessary Abstraction,Autolithium.ion,InputUnion,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' mi' ki' hi
Unnecessary Abstraction,Autolithium.ion,HARDWAREINPUT,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Autolithium.ion,Mouse,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MouseUpdater' SpeedY
Deficient Encapsulation,Autolithium.ion,Mouse,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MouseUpdater' SpeedY
Broken Modularization,Autolithium.ion,MOUSEINPUT,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dx' dy' mouseData' dwFlags' time' dwExtraInfo
Broken Modularization,Autolithium.ion,KEYBDINPUT,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.ion\VirtualMouse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
