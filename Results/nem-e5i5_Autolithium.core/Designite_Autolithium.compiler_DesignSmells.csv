Duplicate Abstraction,Autolithium.compiler,ASMInclude,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\ASMInclude.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ASMInclude[1' 32]' AssemblyFunction[1' 32]' Program[1' 32]' GenerateMultiCastDelegate[1' 32]

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ASMInclude[1' 36]' GenerateMultiCastDelegate[1' 36]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Autolithium.compiler,AssemblyFunction,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\AssemblyScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Method' DelegateType' DelegateField
Unutilized Abstraction,Autolithium.compiler,Program,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\Compile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Autolithium.compiler,GenerateMultiCastDelegate,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\GenerateMultiCastDelegate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Autolithium.compiler,AssemblyFunction,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\AssemblyScope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Method' DelegateType' DelegateField
Deficient Encapsulation,Autolithium.compiler,Program,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\Compile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GlobalVars
Deficient Encapsulation,Autolithium.compiler,Program,C:\repos\nem-e5i5_Autolithium.core\Autolithium.compiler\Compile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: GlobalVars
