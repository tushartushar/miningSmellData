Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Buffer' BufferLength
Deficient Encapsulation,Stampsy.Social,SessionManager,C:\repos\stampsy_Stampsy.Social\src\Stampsy.Social\SessionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StateChanged
Broken Modularization,Stampsy.Social,Metadata,C:\repos\stampsy_Stampsy.Social\src\Stampsy.Social\Services\DropboxManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Contents' Size' Hash' TotalBytes' ThumbnailExists' Revision' Modified' ClientModified' Path' IsDirectory' Icon' Root' Name' Extension' _contents
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stampsy.Social,DropboxManager,C:\repos\stampsy_Stampsy.Social\src\Stampsy.Social\Services\DropboxManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ShareAsync' GetFriendsAsync
Broken Hierarchy,Stampsy.Social,ServiceManager,C:\repos\stampsy_Stampsy.Social\src\Stampsy.Social\Services\ServiceManager.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Stampsy.Social.SessionManager
