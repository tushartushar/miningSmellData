Cyclic Dependency,JinianNet.JNTemplate,JinianNet.JNTemplate,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: JinianNet.JNTemplate' JinianNet.JNTemplate.Parser
Cyclic Dependency,JinianNet.JNTemplate,JinianNet.JNTemplate,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: JinianNet.JNTemplate' JinianNet.JNTemplate.Parser.Node' JinianNet.JNTemplate.Parser
Unstable Dependency,JinianNet.JNTemplate,JinianNet.JNTemplate,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): JinianNet.JNTemplate.Parser' JinianNet.JNTemplate.Configuration
