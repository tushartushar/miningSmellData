Unnecessary Abstraction,ZXing.Net.Mobile,NotSupported,C:\repos\Redth_ZXing.Net.Mobile\Source\ZXing.Net.Mobile.WindowsRT\NotSupported.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ZXing.Net.Mobile,NotSupported,C:\repos\Redth_ZXing.Net.Mobile\Source\ZXing.Net.Mobile.WindowsRT\NotSupported.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ZXing.Net.Mobile,NotSupported,C:\repos\Redth_ZXing.Net.Mobile\Source\ZXing.Net.Mobile.WindowsRT\NotSupported.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: ZXing.Net.Mobile.NotSupported' ZXing.Mobile.NotSupported
