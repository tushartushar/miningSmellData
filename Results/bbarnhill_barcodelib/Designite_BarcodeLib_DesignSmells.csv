Unutilized Abstraction,BarcodeLib,Barcode,F:\newReposMay17\bbarnhill_barcodelib\BarcodeLib\BarcodeLib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,BarcodeLib,BarcodeXML,F:\newReposMay17\bbarnhill_barcodelib\BarcodeLib\BarcodeXML.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BarcodeXML[234' 270]' BarcodeXML[716' 752]
Unnecessary Abstraction,BarcodeLib,IBarcode,F:\newReposMay17\bbarnhill_barcodelib\BarcodeLib\IBarcode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Encoded_Value' RawData' Errors
Unnecessary Abstraction,BarcodeLib.Symbologies,Blank,F:\newReposMay17\bbarnhill_barcodelib\BarcodeLib\Symbologies\Blank.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Insufficient Modularization,BarcodeLib,Barcode,F:\newReposMay17\bbarnhill_barcodelib\BarcodeLib\BarcodeLib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,BarcodeLib,Barcode,F:\newReposMay17\bbarnhill_barcodelib\BarcodeLib\BarcodeLib.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 277
