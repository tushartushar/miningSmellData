Unutilized Abstraction,HealthGraphNet.Samples.Web,_Default,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tron5000_HealthGraphNet\HealthGraphNet.Samples\Web\Default.aspx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HealthGraphNet.Samples.Web,Global,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tron5000_HealthGraphNet\HealthGraphNet.Samples\Web\Global.asax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HealthGraphNet.Samples.Web,SiteMaster,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tron5000_HealthGraphNet\HealthGraphNet.Samples\Web\Site.Master.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,HealthGraphNet.Samples.Web,WebAuthenticator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tron5000_HealthGraphNet\HealthGraphNet.Samples\Web\WebAuthenticator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnPageLoaded which is more interested in members of the type: HealthGraphClient
Broken Hierarchy,HealthGraphNet.Samples.Web,WebAuthenticator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Tron5000_HealthGraphNet\HealthGraphNet.Samples\Web\WebAuthenticator.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HealthGraphNet.RestSharp.StaticAuthenticator
