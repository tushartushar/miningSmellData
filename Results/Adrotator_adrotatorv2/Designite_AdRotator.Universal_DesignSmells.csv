Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AdRotator,AdRotatorControl,C:\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\AdRotatorControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AdRotator.AdRotatorControl' AdRotator.DefaultHouseAd
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AdRotator,DefaultHouseAd,C:\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\DefaultHouseAd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AdRotator.DefaultHouseAd' AdRotator.AdRotatorControl
Insufficient Modularization,AdRotator,FileHelpers,C:\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
