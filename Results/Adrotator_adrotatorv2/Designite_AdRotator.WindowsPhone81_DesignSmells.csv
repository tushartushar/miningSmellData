Feature Envy,AdRotator,AdRotatorControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\AdRotatorControl.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnAdRefreshIntervalPropertyChanged which is more interested in members of the type: AdRotatorComponent
Duplicate Abstraction,AdRotator,FileHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FileHelpers (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs' [150' 186])' FileHelpers (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs' [196' 232])
Deficient Encapsulation,AdRotator,DefaultHouseAd,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\DefaultHouseAd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HouseAdBody' DefaultHouseAdURL
Insufficient Modularization,AdRotator,AdRotatorControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\AdRotatorControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 37 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AdRotator,FileHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AdRotator,FileHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,AdRotator,FileHelpers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Adrotator_adrotatorv2\AdRotator\Utilities\FileHelpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FileOpen' FileCreate' FileDelete' DirectoryGetDirectories' StreamClose
