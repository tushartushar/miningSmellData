Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,AITests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\AITests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,CardCostTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\CardCostTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,CardMovementTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\CardMovementTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,DeckTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\DeckTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,HelperExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\HelperExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,ProbabilityDistributionTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\ProbabilityDistributionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,ProbabilityDistributionTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\ProbabilityDistributionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ProbabilityDistributionTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\ProbabilityDistributionTests.cs' [84' 107])' ProbabilityDistributionTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\ProbabilityDistributionTests.cs' [111' 134])
Unutilized Abstraction,Dominion.Tests,SpecificationExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\SpecificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Dominion.Tests,SpecificationExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\SpecificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dominion.Tests,SpecificationExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulbatum_Dominion\Dominion.Tests\SpecificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
