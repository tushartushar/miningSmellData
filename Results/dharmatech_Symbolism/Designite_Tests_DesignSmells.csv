Insufficient Modularization,SymbolismTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dharmatech_Symbolism\Tests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 305 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SymbolismTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dharmatech_Symbolism\Tests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 309 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SymbolismTests,Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dharmatech_Symbolism\Tests\Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 309
