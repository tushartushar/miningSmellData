Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Finite,OutputWindow,C:\repos\pmichna_Finite\Finite\OutputWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: OutputWindow[126' 155]' SimulationWindow[196' 225]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Finite,App,C:\repos\pmichna_Finite\Finite\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Finite,MainWindow,C:\repos\pmichna_Finite\Finite\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Finite.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\pmichna_Finite\Finite\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Finite,State,C:\repos\pmichna_Finite\Finite\State.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: transistions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Finite,DFA,C:\repos\pmichna_Finite\Finite\DFA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DFA' DFABuilder
