Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Conclave.Process,ConcurrentDataDictionaryEx,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\ConcurrentDataDictionaryEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Conclave.Process,DataCollectionEx,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\DataCollectionEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Conclave.Process,ProcessContext,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\ProcessContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Unutilized Abstraction,Conclave.Process.User,GlobalRoleEx,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\User\GlobalRoleEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Conclave.Process.User,IUserCredentials,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\User\IUserCredentials.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Password' Mask' Email
Multifaceted Abstraction,Conclave.Process.User,UserCredentials,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\User\UserCredentials.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.85
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Conclave.Process,Event,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Event' ProcessContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Conclave.Process,Event,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\Event.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Event' ProcessContext' IProcessBehaviour' ProcessContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Conclave.Process,RuntimeBehaviour,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\RuntimeBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RuntimeBehaviour' ProcessContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Conclave.Process,RuntimeBehaviour,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\RuntimeBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RuntimeBehaviour' ProcessContext' IProcessBehaviour' ProcessContext
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Conclave.Process,IProcessBehaviour,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\IProcessBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IProcessBehaviour' ProcessContext
Rebellious Hierarchy,Conclave.Process,ProcessActionBehaviour,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\ProcessActionBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Action
Wide Hierarchy,Conclave.Process,ProcessBehaviour,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\ProcessBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: AddDataToControlStateBehaviour' AddBehaviourListsBehaviour' ProcessActionBehaviour' RuntimeBehaviour' SimpleSequenceBehaviour' WebBehaviour' GetAssociationBehaviour' GetTopicBehaviour' ResolveNavigationBehaviour' ResolveOccurrencesBehaviour' UpdateMarkdownBehaviour' UpdateMetadataBehaviour' UpdateOccurrenceBehaviour' ParseMarkdownBehaviour' ResolveMarkdownBehaviour
Rebellious Hierarchy,Conclave.Process,ProcessBehaviour,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\ProcessBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Action
Broken Hierarchy,Conclave.Process,ProcessTimerDictionary,C:\repos\guy-murphy_conclave-public\Conclave.Process\ProcessTimerDictionary.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ConcurrentDataDictionary
