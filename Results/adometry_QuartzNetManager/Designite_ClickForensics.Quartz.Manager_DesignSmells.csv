Unutilized Abstraction,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,AddListenerForm,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\AddListenerForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,SimpleTriggerDisplay,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\SimpleTriggerDisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,NativeJobDetailDisplay,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\NativeJobDetailDisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,MainForm,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,CronTriggerDisplay,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\CronTriggerDisplay.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,MainForm,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Missing Hierarchy,ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager,MainForm,C:\repos\adometry_QuartzNetManager\ClickForensics.Quartz.Manager\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: TriggerNode' JobNode' TriggerNode (in method "jobGroupsTreeView_AfterSelect" of class "MainForm").
