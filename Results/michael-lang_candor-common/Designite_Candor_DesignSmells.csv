Duplicate Abstraction,Candor,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StringExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\StringExtensions.cs' [174' 196])' StringExtensions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\StringExtensions.cs' [218' 240])
Unutilized Abstraction,Candor.Reflection,ReflectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Reflection\ReflectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Candor.Tasks,IterationResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Tasks\IterationResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NextWaitingPeriodSeconds
Unutilized Abstraction,Candor.Tasks,WorkerRole,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Tasks\WorkerRole.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Candor.Data,DataRecordExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Data\DataRecordExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 53 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Candor.Data,DataRecordExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Data\DataRecordExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 53 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Candor.Data,DataRecordExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Data\DataRecordExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 109
Broken Modularization,Candor.Data,SequenceIdSchema,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Data\SequenceIdSchema.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.

Broken Modularization,Candor.Data,SequenceIdStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\Data\SequenceIdStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IdLock' Schema' CharacterSet' LastId' FinalCachedId' _idLock
Insufficient Modularization,Candor,ExecutionResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\ExecutionResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,Candor,PagingAndSortOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\michael-lang_candor-common\Candor\PagingAndSortOptions.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Candor.PagingOptions
