Duplicate Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\NodeDef.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree.Helper' Clifton.Windows.Forms.Helper
Duplicate Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\NodeDef.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Helper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\NodeDef.cs' [10' 47])' Helper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs' [47' 84])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,RootNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\RootNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,XmlTreeException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\XtreeNodeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Helper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs' [1012' 1034])' Helper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs' [1096' 1118])
Duplicate Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms,Helper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Helper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs' [1243' 1263])' Helper (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs' [1309' 1329])
Unutilized Abstraction,Clifton.Windows.Forms,XTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Clifton.Windows.Forms,ControllerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: type' data
Insufficient Modularization,Clifton.Windows.Forms,XTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Clifton.Windows.Forms,XTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XTree.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 135
Rebellious Hierarchy,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,PlaceholderInstance,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\PlaceholderInstance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Select' MoveTo
Broken Hierarchy,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,RootNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\RootNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree.NodeDef
Rebellious Hierarchy,Clifton.Windows.Forms.XmlTree,XtreeNodeController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Windows.Forms\XmlTree\XtreeNodeController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Index' AddNode' DeleteNode' AutoDeleteNode' Select
