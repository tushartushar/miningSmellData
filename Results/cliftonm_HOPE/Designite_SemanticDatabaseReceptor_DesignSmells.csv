Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,IDatabaseIO,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\IDatabaseIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IDatabaseIO (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\IDatabaseIO.cs' [1' 21])' ISemanticDatabase (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\ISemanticDatabase.cs' [1' 21])' PostgresIO (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\PostgresIO.cs' [1' 21])' SQLiteIO (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SQLiteIO.cs' [1' 21])

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IDatabaseIO (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\IDatabaseIO.cs' [1' 23])' PostgresIO (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\PostgresIO.cs' [1' 23])' SQLiteIO (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SQLiteIO.cs' [1' 23])
Unutilized Abstraction,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,FieldValue,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,TypeIntersection,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BaseType' JoinType
Deficient Encapsulation,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,SemanticDatabase,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dbio
Insufficient Modularization,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,SemanticDatabase,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,SemanticDatabase,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 113
Rebellious Hierarchy,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,PostgresIO,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\PostgresIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateDBIfMissing
