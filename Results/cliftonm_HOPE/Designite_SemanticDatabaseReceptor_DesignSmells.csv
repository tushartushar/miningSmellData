Duplicate Abstraction,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,IDatabaseIO,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\IDatabaseIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IDatabaseIO[1' 21]' ISemanticDatabase[1' 21]' PostgresIO[1' 21]' SQLiteIO[1' 21]

Deficient Encapsulation,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,TypeIntersection,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: BaseType' JoinType
Deficient Encapsulation,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,SemanticDatabase,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dbio
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,FieldValue,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FieldValue' TableFieldValues
Insufficient Modularization,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,SemanticDatabase,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,SemanticDatabase,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\SemanticDatabaseReceptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 128
Rebellious Hierarchy,SemanticDatabaseReceptor,PostgresIO,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\SemanticDatabaseReceptor\PostgresIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateDBIfMissing
