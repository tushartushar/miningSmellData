Unutilized Abstraction,Clifton.Receptor,Binding,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Binding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Clifton.Receptor,Binding,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Binding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Binding (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Binding.cs' [1' 23])' BindingSource (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\BindingSource.cs' [1' 23])' Membrane (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Membrane.cs' [1' 23])' QueuedCarrierAction (C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Receptors.cs' [1' 23])

Unnecessary Abstraction,Clifton.Receptor,QueuedCarrierAction,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Receptors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: From' Carrier' Action
Insufficient Modularization,Clifton.Receptor,Membrane,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Membrane.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Clifton.Receptor,ReceptorsContainer,C:\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.Receptor\Receptors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
