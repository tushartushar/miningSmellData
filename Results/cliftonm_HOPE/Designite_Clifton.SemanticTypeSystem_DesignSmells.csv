Unutilized Abstraction,Clifton.SemanticTypeSystem,NewSemanticTypeEventArgs,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.SemanticTypeSystem\STS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Clifton.SemanticTypeSystem,SemanticTypeInstance,F:\newReposMay17\cliftonm_HOPE\Clifton.SemanticTypeSystem\SemanticTypeInstance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
