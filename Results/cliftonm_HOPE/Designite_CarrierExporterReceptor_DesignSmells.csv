Missing Hierarchy,CarrierExporterReceptor,ReceptorDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cliftonm_HOPE\Receptors\CarrierExporterReceptor\ReceptorDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ICarrier' IRuntimeSemanticType (in method "CreateSubNodes" of class "ReceptorDefinition").
