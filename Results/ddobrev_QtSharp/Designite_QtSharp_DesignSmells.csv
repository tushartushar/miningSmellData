Deficient Encapsulation,QtSharp,QtInfo,C:\repos\ddobrev_QtSharp\QtSharp\QtInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MajorVersion' MinorVersion' Path' Target' Docs' QMake' Make' Bins' Libs' Headers' LibFiles' SystemIncludeDirs' FrameworkDirs
Broken Modularization,QtSharp.DocGeneration,DocIndexNode,C:\repos\ddobrev_QtSharp\QtSharp\DocGeneration\DocIndexNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Location' LineNumber' HRef' IsObsolete
Insufficient Modularization,QtSharp.DocGeneration,Documentation,C:\repos\ddobrev_QtSharp\QtSharp\DocGeneration\Documentation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Broken Modularization,QtSharp,QtInfo,C:\repos\ddobrev_QtSharp\QtSharp\QtInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MajorVersion' MinorVersion' Path' Target' Docs' QMake' Make' Bins' Libs' Headers' LibFiles' SystemIncludeDirs' FrameworkDirs
Rebellious Hierarchy,QtSharp,QFlags,C:\repos\ddobrev_QtSharp\QtSharp\QFlags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CSharpConstruct
