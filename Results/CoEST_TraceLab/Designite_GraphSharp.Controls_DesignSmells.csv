Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,GraphSharp.Controls,GraphLayout,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Controls\Controls\GraphLayout.DependencyProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: VertexControl' EdgeControl (in method "HighlightTriggerEventHandler" of class "GraphLayout").
Insufficient Modularization,GraphSharp.Controls,GraphLayout,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Controls\Controls\GraphLayout.DependencyProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GraphSharp.Controls,GraphLayout,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Controls\Controls\GraphLayout.DependencyProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods.
