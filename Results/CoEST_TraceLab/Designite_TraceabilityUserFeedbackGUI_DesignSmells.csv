Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,Config,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: WeightsThreshold' OutSavePath
Duplicate Abstraction,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,Config,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Config[1' 20]' SimilarityMatrixUserFeedbackExporter[1' 20]' SimilarityMatrixUserFeedback[1' 20]' WeightsSorter[1' 20]
Duplicate Abstraction,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,SimilarityMatrixUserFeedbackExporter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\SimilarityMatrixUserFeedbackExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SimilarityMatrixUserFeedbackExporter[1' 23]' SimilarityMatrixUserFeedback[1' 23]
Unnecessary Abstraction,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,SimilarityMatrixUserFeedbackExporterConfig,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\SimilarityMatrixUserFeedbackExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path' m_path
Unutilized Abstraction,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,WeightsSorter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\WeightsSorter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,WeightsSorter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\WeightsSorter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Column' Order
Multipath Hierarchy,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,SimilarityMatrixUserFeedback,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\SimilarityMatrixUserFeedback.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IRawSerializable
Rebellious Hierarchy,TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI,SimilarityMatrixUserFeedback,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\TraceabilityUserFeedbackGUI\SimilarityMatrixUserFeedback.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ReadXml
