Unutilized Abstraction,WPG.Controls.WPG.Converters,ObjectVisualConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Converters\ObjectVisualConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WPG.Data,Property,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Data\Property.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: instance_PropertyChanged
Unnecessary Abstraction,WPG,FlatAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\FlatAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,WPG,PropertyGrid,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\PropertyGrid.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ShowHeaderProperty' FilterProperty' CategorizedProperty' ShowPreviewProperty' ShowDescriptionProperty' NameWidthProperty' AutomaticlyExpandObjectsProperty
Deficient Encapsulation,WPG,PropertyGrid,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\PropertyGrid.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ShowHeaderProperty' FilterProperty' CategorizedProperty' ShowPreviewProperty' ShowDescriptionProperty' NameWidthProperty' AutomaticlyExpandObjectsProperty
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WPG.Data,ExpandableProperty,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Data\ExpandableProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WPG.Data.ExpandableProperty' WPG.Data.PropertyCollection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WPG.Data,PropertyCategory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Data\PropertyCategory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WPG.Data.PropertyCategory' WPG.Data.PropertyCollection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WPG,PropertyGrid,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\PropertyGrid.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WPG.PropertyGrid' WPG.PropertyTemplateSelector
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WPG.Data,ExpandableProperty,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Data\ExpandableProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WPG.Data.ExpandableProperty' WPG.Data.PropertyCollection' WPG.Data.PropertyCategory
Rebellious Hierarchy,WPG.Controls.WPG.Converters,CustomFieldPropertyDescriptor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Converters\CollectionPropertyDescriptionProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResetValue' SetValue
Cyclic Hierarchy,WPG.Data,PropertyCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPG\Data\PropertyCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PropertyCategory
