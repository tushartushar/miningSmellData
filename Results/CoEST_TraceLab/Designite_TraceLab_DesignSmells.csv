Imperative Abstraction,TraceLab,KeyValidator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\KeyValidator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ValidateKey
Imperative Abstraction,TraceLab,TraceLabApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Duplicate Abstraction,TraceLab,TraceLabApplication,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.
