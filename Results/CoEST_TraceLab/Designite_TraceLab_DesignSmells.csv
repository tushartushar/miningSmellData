Duplicate Abstraction,TraceLab,InvalidKeyException,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\InvalidKeyException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  InvalidKeyException (C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\InvalidKeyException.cs' [1' 24])' TraceLabApplicationGUI (C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplicationGUI.cs' [1' 24])
Imperative Abstraction,TraceLab,TraceLabApplication,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Duplicate Abstraction,TraceLab,TraceLabApplication,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplication.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TraceLabApplication (C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplication.cs' [292' 312])' TraceLabApplication (C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplication.cs' [348' 368])
Imperative Abstraction,TraceLab,TraceLabApplicationGUI,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\TraceLabApplicationGUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SignalExternalFirstApplicationInstance
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Shell,WM,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\SingleInstance.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TraceLab.Properties,Resources,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Resources (C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\Properties\Resources.Designer.cs' [1' 27])' Settings (C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs' [1' 27])
Unnecessary Abstraction,TraceLab.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\TraceLab\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
