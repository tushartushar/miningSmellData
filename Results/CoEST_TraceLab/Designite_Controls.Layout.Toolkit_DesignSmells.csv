This class contains only the following public method: GetPattern
Imperative Abstraction,System.Windows.Controls.Primitives,ExpandableContentControl,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\ExpandableContentControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnApplyTemplate
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Windows.Controls,AccordionItem,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\AccordionItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SelectedEvent' UnselectedEvent
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Windows.Controls,AccordionItem,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\AccordionItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SelectedEvent' UnselectedEvent
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,Accordion,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\Accordion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 49 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,Accordion,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\Accordion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 226
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,Accordion,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\Accordion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Accordion' AccordionItem
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,AccordionItem,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\AccordionItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Controls,AccordionItem,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\AccordionItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Unfactored Hierarchy,System.Windows.Controls,Accordion,F:\newReposMay17\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\WPFToolkit\Source\Layout\Accordion\System\Windows\Controls\Accordion.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Accordion[2020' 2044]' AccordionItem[1171' 1195]
