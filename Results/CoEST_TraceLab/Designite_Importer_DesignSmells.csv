Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Importer,AnswerMatrixImporter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\AnswerMatrixImporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AnswerMatrixImporter[1' 20]' ImporterConfig[1' 20]' StopwordsImporterConfig[1' 20]' InvalidManualTracesDataException[1' 20]' PoirotXMLImporter[1' 20]' StopwordsImporter[1' 20]' StopwordsReader[1' 20]
Duplicate Abstraction,Importer,AnswerMatrixImporter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\AnswerMatrixImporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AnswerMatrixImporter[1' 21]' PoirotXMLImporter[1' 21]' StopwordsReader[1' 21]' StopwordsImporter[1' 21]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Importer,AnswerMatrixImporterConfig,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\AnswerMatrixImporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path' Separator' m_path' m_separator
Duplicate Abstraction,Importer,ImporterConfig,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\ImporterConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ImporterConfig[34' 53]' StopwordsImporterConfig[28' 47]
Duplicate Abstraction,Importer,PoirotXMLImporter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\PoirotXMLImporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PoirotXMLImporter[1' 26]' StopwordsReader[1' 26]
Unutilized Abstraction,TemplateProcessor.exceptions,InvalidManualTracesDataException,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\exceptions\InvalidManualTracesDataException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unfactored Hierarchy,Importer,AnswerMatrixImporter,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\Importer\AnswerMatrixImporter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: AnswerMatrixImporter[1' 23]' StopwordsImporter[1' 23]
