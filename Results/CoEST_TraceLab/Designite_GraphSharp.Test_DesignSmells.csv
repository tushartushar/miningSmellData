Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphSharp.Test.Algorithms,CompoundFDPForceTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Algorithms\CompoundFDPForceTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,GraphSharp.Test.Algorithms,CompoundFDPForceTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Algorithms\CompoundFDPForceTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetSpringForce which is more interested in members of the type: CompoundFDPLayoutParameters
Unutilized Abstraction,Palesz.QuickGraph.Test.Generators,GraphGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Generators\GraphGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphSharp.Test,GraphHelperTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\GraphHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphSharp.Test,LayeredTopologicalSortAlgorithmTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\LayeredTopologicalSortAlgorithmTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GraphSharp.Test,LayoutUtilTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\LayoutHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphSharp.Test,CrossCounterPair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\LayoutHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Markable' Marked
Unnecessary Abstraction,GraphSharp.Test,CrossCounterTreeNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\LayoutHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Accumulator' InnerSegmentMarker' NonInnerSegmentQueue
Unutilized Abstraction,Palesz.QuickGraph.Test.Metrics,EdgeMetricCalculator<TVertex;TEdge;TGraph>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Metrics\EdgeMetricCalculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Palesz.QuickGraph.Test.Metrics,LayoutAreaMetricCalculator<TVertex;TEdge;TGraph>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Metrics\LayoutAreaMetricCalculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Palesz.QuickGraph.Test.Metrics,OverlapMetricCalculator<TVertex;TEdge;TGraph>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Metrics\OverlapMetricCalculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphSharp.Test,CrossCounterPair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\LayoutHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Markable' Marked
Deficient Encapsulation,GraphSharp.Test,CrossCounterTreeNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\LayoutHelperTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Accumulator' InnerSegmentMarker
Rebellious Hierarchy,Palesz.QuickGraph.Test.Metrics,MetricCalculatorBase<TVertex;TEdge;TGraph>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\external\GraphSharp\Source\GraphSharp.Test\Metrics\MetricCalculatorBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Calculate
