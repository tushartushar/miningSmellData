Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Controls.Input.Toolkit,System.Windows.Controls,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: System.Windows.Controls' System.Windows.Automation.Peers
Unstable Dependency,Controls.Input.Toolkit,System.Windows.Automation.Peers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): System.Windows.Controls
Feature Concentration,Controls.Input.Toolkit,System.Windows.Controls,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BindingEvaluator]' [Extensions]' [InteractionHelper' IUpdateVisualState' VisualStates' AutoCompleteBox' AutoCompleteSearch' AutoCompleteFilterMode' ISelectionAdapter' PopulatedEventArgs' PopulatingEventArgs' PopupHelper' SelectorSelectionAdapter' Rating' RatingItem' RatingSelectionMode' Tuple' EnumerableFunctions' NullableConverter]' [ItemsControlHelper]' [VisualTreeExtensions]' [WeakEventListener]' [RoutedPropertyChangingEventArgs].
