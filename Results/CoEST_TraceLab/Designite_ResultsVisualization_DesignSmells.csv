Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ResultsVisualization.Charts,BoxData,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\Charts\BoxData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Draw
Duplicate Abstraction,ResultsVisualization.Charts,Chart,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\Charts\Chart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Chart[1' 21]' LineData[1' 21]
Duplicate Abstraction,ResultsVisualization.Charts,Chart,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\Charts\Chart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Chart[1' 20]' ResultsVisualizationWindow[1' 20]' LineData[1' 20]
Deficient Encapsulation,ResultsVisualization.Charts,Chart,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\Charts\Chart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Colors
Deficient Encapsulation,ResultsVisualization.Charts,Chart,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\Charts\Chart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Colors
Unexloited Encapsulation,ResultsVisualization,ResultsVisualizationHelper,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\ResultsVisualizationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BoxPlot' LineChart (in method "StoreTechnique" of class "ResultsVisualizationHelper").
Unfactored Hierarchy,ResultsVisualization.Charts,BoxPlot,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\Charts\BoxPlot.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: BoxPlot[1' 26]' LineChart[1' 26]
Missing Hierarchy,ResultsVisualization,ResultsVisualizationHelper,C:\repos\CoEST_TraceLab\Main\ComponentsSources\SAREC-DePaul\TraceLab Components Source\ResultsVisualization\ResultsVisualizationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: BoxSummaryData' BoxPlot (in method "StoreTechnique" of class "ResultsVisualizationHelper").
