Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Services.Device,DeviceService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Services\Device\DeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.85
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Services.Device,ProviderVersionPair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Services\Device\DeviceService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Provider' Version
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation,PEImageReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PEImageReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation,DirectoryEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PEImageReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RelativeVirtualAddress' Size
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation.Platform,PlatformApplicationLifecycle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PlatformApplicationLifecycle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp,HockeyClientExtensionsUwp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\HockeyClientExtensionsUwp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Services.Device,_SYSTEM_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Services\Device\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: wProcessorArchitecture' wReserved' dwPageSize' lpMinimumApplicationAddress' lpMaximumApplicationAddress' dwActiveProcessorMask' dwNumberOfProcessors' dwProcessorType' dwAllocationGranularity' wProcessorLevel' wProcessorRevision
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation,DirectoryEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PEImageReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RelativeVirtualAddress' Size
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation,DebugDirectory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PEImageReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Characteristics' TimeDateStamp' MajorVersion' MinorVersion' Type' SizeOfData' AddressOfRawData' PointerToRawData
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Services.Device,_SYSTEM_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Services\Device\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' wProcessorArchitecture' wReserved' dwPageSize' lpMinimumApplicationAddress' lpMaximumApplicationAddress' dwActiveProcessorMask' dwNumberOfProcessors' dwProcessorType' dwAllocationGranularity' wProcessorLevel' wProcessorRevision
Broken Modularization,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation,DebugDirectory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PEImageReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Characteristics' TimeDateStamp' MajorVersion' MinorVersion' Type' SizeOfData' AddressOfRawData' PointerToRawData
