This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation,DirectoryEntry,C:\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PEImageReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RelativeVirtualAddress' Size
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp.Extensibility.Implementation.Platform,PlatformApplicationLifecycle,C:\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\Extensibility\PlatformApplicationLifecycle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.HockeyApp,HockeyClientExtensionsUwp,C:\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.UWP\HockeyClientExtensionsUwp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
