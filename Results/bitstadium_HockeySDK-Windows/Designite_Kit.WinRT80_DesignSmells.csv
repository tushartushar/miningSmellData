Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,HockeyApp,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.WinRT80\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CRASHPATHNAME' CrashFilePrefix' USER_AGENT_STRING' SDKNAME' SDKVERSION
Duplicate Abstraction,HockeyApp,CrashHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.WinRT80\CrashHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CrashHandler (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.WinRT80\CrashHandler.cs' [71' 92])' CrashHandler (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.WinRT80\CrashHandler.cs' [103' 124])
Unutilized Abstraction,HockeyApp,HockeyClientWinRT80,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.WinRT80\HockeyClientWinRT80.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,HockeyApp,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bitstadium_HockeySDK-Windows\Src\Kit.WinRT80\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' CRASHPATHNAME' CrashFilePrefix' USER_AGENT_STRING' SDKNAME' SDKVERSION
