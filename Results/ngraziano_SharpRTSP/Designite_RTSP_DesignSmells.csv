Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequest,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateResponse
Imperative Abstraction,Rtsp.Sdp,SdpFile,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Sdp\SdpFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Read
Unutilized Abstraction,Rtsp.Sdp,Timing,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Sdp\Timing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,Rtsp,RtspListener,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\RTSPListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: RtspData' RtspResponse' RtspData (in method "DoJob" of class "RtspListener").
Broken Modularization,Rtsp.Messages,RtspHeaderNames,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPHeaderNames.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ContentBase' ContentEncoding' ContentType' Public' Session' Transport' WWWAuthenticate' Authorization
Cyclic Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspMessage,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequest,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspMessage
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestAnnounce,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestAnnounce.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestDescribe,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestDescribe.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestPause,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestPause.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestPlay,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestPlay.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestRecord,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RtspRequestRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestSetup,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestSetup.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestGetParameter,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestGetParameter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspRequestTeardown,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPRequestTeardown.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspRequest
Broken Hierarchy,Rtsp.Messages,RtspResponse,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Messages\RTSPResponse.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rtsp.Messages.RtspMessage
Cyclic Hierarchy,Rtsp.Sdp,Connection,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Sdp\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ConnectionIP4
Cyclic Hierarchy,Rtsp.Sdp,Connection,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RTSP\Sdp\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ConnectionIP6
