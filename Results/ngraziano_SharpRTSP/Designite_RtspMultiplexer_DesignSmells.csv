Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleRequestPush which is more interested in members of the type: RtspPushManager
Feature Envy,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleRequestPull which is more interested in members of the type: RtspPushManager
Unexploited Encapsulation,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: RtspRequest' RtspRequest' RtspRequest (in method "HandleOneMessage" of class "RTSPDispatcher").
Unexploited Encapsulation,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: UDPForwarder' TCPtoUDPForwader' TCPtoUDPForwader (in method "ConfigureTransportAndForwarder" of class "RTSPDispatcher").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RtspMulticaster.RTSPDispatcher' RtspMulticaster.RtspSession
