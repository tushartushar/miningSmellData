Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,RtspMulticaster,RTCPType,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\Fowarder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,RtspMulticaster,RtspSession,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Unexploited Encapsulation,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: RtspRequest' RtspRequest' RtspRequest (in method "HandleOneMessage" of class "RTSPDispatcher").
Unexploited Encapsulation,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: UDPForwarder' TCPtoUDPForwader' TCPtoUDPForwader (in method "ConfigureTransportAndForwarder" of class "RTSPDispatcher").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RtspMulticaster,RTSPDispatcher,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspDispatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RtspMulticaster.RTSPDispatcher' RtspMulticaster.RtspSession
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RtspMulticaster,RtspSession,C:\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspMultiplexer\RtspSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RtspMulticaster.RtspSession' RtspMulticaster.RTSPDispatcher
