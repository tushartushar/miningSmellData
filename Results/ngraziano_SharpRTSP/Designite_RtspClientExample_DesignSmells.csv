Imperative Abstraction,RtspClientExample,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspClientExample\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unexploited Encapsulation,RtspClientExample,RTSPClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspClientExample\RTSPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: RtspRequestOptions' RtspRequestDescribe' RtspRequestPlay (in method "Rtsp_MessageReceived" of class "RTSPClient").
Insufficient Modularization,RtspClientExample,RTSPClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ngraziano_SharpRTSP\RtspClientExample\RTSPClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 142
