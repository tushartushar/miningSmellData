Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,HeDArtifactUtility,ArtifactUtility,C:\repos\cqframework_healthedecisions\tooling\framework\HeDArtifactUtility\ArtifactUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,HeDArtifactUtility,UtilitySettings,C:\repos\cqframework_healthedecisions\tooling\framework\HeDArtifactUtility\UtilitySettings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' MapLocation' SchemaLocation' defaultInstance
Multifaceted Abstraction,CommandLine,Parser,C:\repos\cqframework_healthedecisions\tooling\framework\HeDArtifactUtility\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.99
Unutilized Abstraction,CommandLine,Parser,C:\repos\cqframework_healthedecisions\tooling\framework\HeDArtifactUtility\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,HeDArtifactUtility,ArtifactUtility,C:\repos\cqframework_healthedecisions\tooling\framework\HeDArtifactUtility\ArtifactUtility.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: InputFileName' TargetFormat' OutputFileName
Insufficient Modularization,CommandLine,Parser,C:\repos\cqframework_healthedecisions\tooling\framework\HeDArtifactUtility\CommandLineArguments.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
