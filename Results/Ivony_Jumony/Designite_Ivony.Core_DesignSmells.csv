Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Data,PagingExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Data\PagingExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Fluent,ConvertExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\ConvertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ivony.Fluent,Convertor<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\ConvertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' castMethod
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Fluent,DisposableHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\DisposableHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Fluent,EnumerableExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\EnumerableExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Fluent,StringExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\StringExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony,KeyedCache<TKey;TValue>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\KeyedCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Ivony.Fluent,Convertor<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\ConvertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: castMethod
Deficient Encapsulation,Ivony.Fluent,Convertor<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\ConvertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: castMethod
Insufficient Modularization,Ivony.Fluent,EnumerableExtension,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Core\Fluent\EnumerableExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
