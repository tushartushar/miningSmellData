Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,CacheExtensions,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\CacheExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,ClientCachePolicyModule,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ClientCachePolicyModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ivony.Web,ICacheDependency,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ICacheDependency.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HasChanged
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,CacheKeyPolicy,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ICachePolicyProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,WebExtensions,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\WebExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ivony.Web,CacheHelper,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\CacheHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ivony.Web.CacheHelper' Ivony.Web.RawResponse
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ivony.Web,RawResponse,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\RawResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ivony.Web.RawResponse' Ivony.Web.CacheHelper
Multipath Hierarchy,Ivony.Web,RawResponse,C:\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\RawResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICachedResponse
