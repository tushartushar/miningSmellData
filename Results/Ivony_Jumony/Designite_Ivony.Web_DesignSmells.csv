Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,CacheExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\CacheExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,ClientCachePolicyModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ClientCachePolicyModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Ivony.Web,ICacheDependency,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ICacheDependency.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HasChanged
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,CacheKeyPolicy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ICachePolicyProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ivony.Web,WebExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\WebExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ivony.Web,CacheHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\CacheHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ivony.Web.CacheHelper' Ivony.Web.RawResponse
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ivony.Web,CachePolicy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\CachePolicy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ivony.Web.CachePolicy' Ivony.Web.ICachePolicyProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ivony.Web,SimpleRouteRule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\SimpleRouteRule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ivony.Web.SimpleRouteRule' Ivony.Web.SimpleRouteTable
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Ivony.Web,ConflictCheckList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\ConflictCheckList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ivony.Web.ConflictCheckList' Ivony.Web.SimpleRouteTable' Ivony.Web.SimpleRouteRule
Multipath Hierarchy,Ivony.Web,RawResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ivony_Jumony\Ivony.Web\RawResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICachedResponse
