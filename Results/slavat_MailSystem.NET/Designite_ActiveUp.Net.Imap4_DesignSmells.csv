Duplicate Abstraction,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Imap4Client,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Imap4\Imap4Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Imap4Client (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Imap4\Imap4Client.cs' [768' 794])' Imap4Client (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Imap4\Imap4Client.cs' [822' 848])
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Fetch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Imap4\Fetch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 183 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Fetch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Imap4\Fetch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 183 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Fetch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Imap4\Fetch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 223
