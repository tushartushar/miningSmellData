Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NewsGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NewsGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NewsGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NewsGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NntpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NntpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 89 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NntpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NntpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 108 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NntpClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NntpClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 137
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NewsGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NewsGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ActiveUp.Net.Mail.NewsGroup' ActiveUp.Net.Mail.NntpClient
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,NewsGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Nntp\NewsGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
