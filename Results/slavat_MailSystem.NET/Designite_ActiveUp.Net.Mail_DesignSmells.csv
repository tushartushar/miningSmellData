Unutilized Abstraction,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Merger,C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\Merger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,RblServer,C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\RblServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RblServer (C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\RblServer.cs' [1' 20])' RblStatus (C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\RblStatus.cs' [1' 20])
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Merger,C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\Merger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Merger,C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\Merger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ActiveUp.Net.Mail,Merger,C:\repos\slavat_MailSystem.NET\Class Library\ActiveUp.Net.Mail\Merger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 110
