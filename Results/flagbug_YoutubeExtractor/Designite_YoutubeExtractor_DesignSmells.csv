Imperative Abstraction,YoutubeExtractor,Decipherer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flagbug_YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\Decipherer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DecipherWithVersion
Unnecessary Abstraction,YoutubeExtractor,ExtractionInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flagbug_YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\DownloadUrlResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RequiresDecryption' Uri
Imperative Abstraction,YoutubeExtractor,VideoInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flagbug_YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\VideoInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,YoutubeExtractor,DownloadUrlResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flagbug_YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\YoutubeExtractor\DownloadUrlResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: YoutubeExtractor.DownloadUrlResolver' YoutubeExtractor.VideoInfo
