Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,NLog.Targets,EventLogTarget,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLog_NLog\src\NLog\Targets\EventLogTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  EventLogTarget (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLog_NLog\src\NLog\Targets\EventLogTarget.cs' [1' 33])' EventLogTargetOverflowAction (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLog_NLog\src\NLog\Targets\EventLogTargetOverflowAction.cs' [1' 33])
Feature Envy,NLog.Targets,EventLogTarget,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLog_NLog\src\NLog\Targets\EventLogTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetEventLog which is more interested in members of the type: IEventLogWrapper
Feature Envy,NLog.Targets,EventLogTarget,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLog_NLog\src\NLog\Targets\EventLogTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateEventSourceIfNeeded which is more interested in members of the type: IEventLogWrapper
Rebellious Hierarchy,NLog.Targets,EventLogWrapper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NLog_NLog\src\NLog\Targets\EventLogTarget.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteEntry' AssociateNewEventLog' DeleteEventSource' SourceExists' LogNameFromSourceName' CreateEventSource
