Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Wox.Infrastructure,Wox.Infrastructure,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Wox.Infrastructure' Wox.Infrastructure.Logger,Wox.Infrastructure.Stopwatch' Wox.Infrastructure.Logger.Log
Unstable Dependency,Wox.Infrastructure,Wox.Infrastructure,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Wox.Infrastructure.Logger,Wox.Infrastructure.Log
Ambiguous Interface,Wox.Infrastructure,Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: PluginsSettings,Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings.PluginsSettings
Feature Concentration,Wox.Infrastructure,Wox.Infrastructure,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Helper]' [Stopwatch' Alphabet' StringMatcher' FuzzyMatcher' MatchResult' MatchOption]' [Constant]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,Wox.Infrastructure.Helper' Wox.Infrastructure.Constant
Feature Concentration,Wox.Infrastructure,Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [HttpProxy]' [CustomPluginHotkey]' [PluginsSettings' Plugin]' [Settings]' [LastQueryMode]' [OpacityMode]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.86,Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings.HttpProxy' Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings.CustomPluginHotkey' Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings.Settings' Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings.LastQueryMode' Wox.Infrastructure.UserSettings.OpacityMode
