Unutilized Abstraction,MemoryMapBridgeProxy,AssignProcessors,C:\repos\darcythomas_HaywireOwin\HaywireOwin\HaywireBridge\AssignProcessors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MemoryMapBridgeProxy,AssignProcessors,C:\repos\darcythomas_HaywireOwin\HaywireOwin\HaywireBridge\AssignProcessors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AssignProcessors[17' 45]' HaywireStartUpMode[169' 197]
Unnecessary Abstraction,MemoryMapBridgeProxy,EventProcessor,C:\repos\darcythomas_HaywireOwin\HaywireOwin\HaywireBridge\EventProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MemoryMapBridgeProxy,EventProcessor,C:\repos\darcythomas_HaywireOwin\HaywireOwin\HaywireBridge\EventProcessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
