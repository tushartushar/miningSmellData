Unnecessary Abstraction,CallbacksTesting2.Cancellation,Message,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\CallbacksTesting\CallbacksTesting_2\Cancellation\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,CallbacksTesting2.Cancellation,Message,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\CallbacksTesting\CallbacksTesting_2\Cancellation\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: CallbacksTesting2.Cancellation.Message' CallbacksTesting2.Enum.Message' CallbacksTesting2.Int.Message' CallbacksTesting2.Object.Message
Unutilized Abstraction,CallbacksTesting2.Cancellation,Usage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\CallbacksTesting\CallbacksTesting_2\Cancellation\Usage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
