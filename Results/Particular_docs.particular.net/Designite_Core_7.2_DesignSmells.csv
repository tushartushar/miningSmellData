Rebellious Hierarchy,Core7.PublishSubscribe,TransportDefinition,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\Core\Core_7.2\PublishSubscribe\DisablePublishing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
Missing Hierarchy,Core7.Recoverability.Delayed.CustomPolicies,FullyCustomizedPolicy,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\Core\Core_7.2\Recoverability\Delayed\CustomPolicies\FullyCustomizedPolicy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MyBusinessTimedOutException' MyOtherBusinessException (in method "MyCustomRetryPolicy" of class "FullyCustomizedPolicy").
