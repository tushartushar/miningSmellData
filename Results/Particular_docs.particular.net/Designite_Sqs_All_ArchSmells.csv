Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Sqs_All,SqsAll.QueueCreation,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: SqsAll.QueueCreation' SqsAll.QueueDeletion,SqsAll.QueueCreation.CreateEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueCreation.Tests' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.Tests,SqsAll.QueueCreation.CreateEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueCreation.Tests' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.Tests
Unstable Dependency,Sqs_All,SqsAll.QueueDeletion,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): SqsAll.QueueCreation,SqsAll.QueueDeletion.CreateEndpointQueues' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueCreationUtils,SqsAll.QueueDeletion.CreateEndpointQueues' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueCreationUtils
Feature Concentration,Sqs_All,SqsAll.ErrorQueue,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ErrorQueue' TransportMessage' Tests' State' MessageToSend]' [HeaderInfo]' [MessageHandler]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.43,SqsAll.ErrorQueue.HeaderInfo' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.MessageHandler,SqsAll.ErrorQueue.ErrorQueue' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.TransportMessage' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.HeaderInfo' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.Tests' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.State' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.MessageHandler' SqsAll.ErrorQueue.MessageToSend
Feature Concentration,Sqs_All,SqsAll.QueueCreation,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CloudFormationHelper' CreateEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' QueueCreationUtils' QueueCreationUtilsCloudFormation' QueueCreationUtilsUsage' Tests' State' MessageToSend' CreateEndpointQueues]' [MessageHandler]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.2,SqsAll.QueueCreation.MessageHandler,SqsAll.QueueCreation.CloudFormationHelper' SqsAll.QueueCreation.CreateEndpointQueues' SqsAll.QueueCreation.CreateEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueCreation.QueueCreationUtils' SqsAll.QueueCreation.QueueCreationUtilsCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueCreation.QueueCreationUtilsUsage' SqsAll.QueueCreation.Tests' SqsAll.QueueCreation.State' SqsAll.QueueCreation.MessageHandler' SqsAll.QueueCreation.MessageToSend
Feature Concentration,Sqs_All,SqsAll.QueueDeletion,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DeleteEndpointQueues' QueueDeletionUtils' QueueDeletionUtilsUsage' Tests' QueueDeletionUtilsCloudFormation' QueueExistenceUtils]' [DeleteEndpointQueuesCloudFormation]' [QueueAccessUtils]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38,SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueAccessUtils,SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueues' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueuesCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueAccessUtils' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueDeletionUtils' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueDeletionUtilsCloudFormation' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueDeletionUtilsUsage' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.QueueExistenceUtils' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.Tests
Scattered Functionality,Sqs_All,SqsAll.NativeSend,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: SqsAll' SqsAll.QueueDeletion,SqsAll.ClientFactory' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueues,SqsAll.ClientFactory' SqsAll.QueueDeletion.DeleteEndpointQueues
