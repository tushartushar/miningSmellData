Unnecessary Abstraction,Core6.Encryption.Conventions,MyMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\PropertyEncryption\PropertyEncryption_2\Conventions\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MyEncryptedProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,Core6.Encryption.Conventions,MyMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\PropertyEncryption\PropertyEncryption_2\Conventions\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Core6.Encryption.Conventions,MyMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\PropertyEncryption\PropertyEncryption_2\Conventions\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Core6.Encryption.Conventions.MyMessage' Core6.Encryption.WireEncryptedProperty.MyMessage
Unutilized Abstraction,Core6.Encryption.Conventions,Usage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Particular_docs.particular.net\Snippets\PropertyEncryption\PropertyEncryption_2\Conventions\Usage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
