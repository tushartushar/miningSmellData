Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools,TestRun,C:\repos\GaryJohnson_wpnest\WPNest\Libraries\UnitTesting\Infrastructure\TestService\TestRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools,TestServiceEngine,C:\repos\GaryJohnson_wpnest\WPNest\Libraries\UnitTesting\Infrastructure\TestService\TestServiceEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ServeRequests
Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools,TestFunctions,C:\repos\GaryJohnson_wpnest\WPNest\Libraries\UnitTesting\Infrastructure\TestService\TestFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessFunction
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools,TestRunResult,C:\repos\GaryJohnson_wpnest\WPNest\Libraries\UnitTesting\Infrastructure\TestService\TestRunResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Log' Total' Failures
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools,TestServiceEngine,C:\repos\GaryJohnson_wpnest\WPNest\Libraries\UnitTesting\Infrastructure\TestService\TestServiceEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools.TestServiceEngine' Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Tools.TestFunctions
