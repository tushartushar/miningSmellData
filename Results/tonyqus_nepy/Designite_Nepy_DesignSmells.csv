Unnecessary Abstraction,Nepy.Configuration,NepySetting,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\Configuration\NepySetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ParserAssemblies' Parsers
Unutilized Abstraction,Nepy.Configuration,ParserCollection,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\Configuration\ParserCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nepy.Configuration,ParserAssemblyLoaderCollection,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\Configuration\ParserAssemblyLoaderCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Nepy.Configuration,ParserAssemblyLoaderSetting,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\Configuration\ParserAssemblyLoaderSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Path
Unnecessary Abstraction,Nepy.Configuration,ParserSetting,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\Configuration\ParserSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Order
Imperative Abstraction,Nepy,NamedEntityRecognizer,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\NamedEntityRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Recognize
Missing Hierarchy,Nepy,NamedEntityRecognizer,C:\repos\tonyqus_nepy\Nepy\NamedEntityRecognizer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IParser' ParserIgnoreAttribute (in method "FindParsers" of class "NamedEntityRecognizer").
