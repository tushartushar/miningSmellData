Deficient Encapsulation,Emgu.CV.UI,PanAndZoomPictureBox,C:\repos\VisionWithGrace_cv\libemgucv-2.2.0.1010-win64\Emgu.CV.UI\PanAndZoomPictureBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ZoomLevels
Deficient Encapsulation,Emgu.CV.UI,PanAndZoomPictureBox,C:\repos\VisionWithGrace_cv\libemgucv-2.2.0.1010-win64\Emgu.CV.UI\PanAndZoomPictureBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ZoomLevels
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Emgu.CV.UI,ImageBox,C:\repos\VisionWithGrace_cv\libemgucv-2.2.0.1010-win64\Emgu.CV.UI\ImageBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageBox' ImagePropertyDialog
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Emgu.CV.UI,ImageProperty,C:\repos\VisionWithGrace_cv\libemgucv-2.2.0.1010-win64\Emgu.CV.UI\ImageProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageProperty' ImageBox
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Emgu.CV.UI,ImageProperty,C:\repos\VisionWithGrace_cv\libemgucv-2.2.0.1010-win64\Emgu.CV.UI\ImageProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageProperty' ImageBox' ImagePropertyDialog' ImageBox
Missing Hierarchy,Emgu.CV.UI,ParameterInputDialog,C:\repos\VisionWithGrace_cv\libemgucv-2.2.0.1010-win64\Emgu.CV.UI\ParameterInputDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MCvScalar' IColor (in method "CreatePanelForParameter" of class "ParameterInputDialog").
