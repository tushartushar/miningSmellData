Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,TDMaker,AboutBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\AboutBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CheckUpdate
Unutilized Abstraction,TDMaker,TextViewer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\TextViewer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TDMaker,AboutBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\AboutBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: uclUpdate
Deficient Encapsulation,TDMaker,MediaWizard,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\MediaWizard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Options
Deficient Encapsulation,TDMaker,ProgramUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\ProgramUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ExplorerFilePaths
Deficient Encapsulation,TDMaker,ProgramUI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\ProgramUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ExplorerFilePaths
Insufficient Modularization,TDMaker,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 115 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TDMaker,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 216
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TDMaker,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\MainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TDMaker.MainWindow' TDMaker.ProgramUI
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TDMaker,AboutBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\McoreD_TDMaker\TDMaker\TDMakerGUI\GUI\AboutBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TDMaker.AboutBox' TDMaker.MainWindow' TDMaker.ProgramUI
