Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Bounce.Framework,BounceRunner,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\refractalize_bounce\Bounce.Framework\BounceRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bounce.Framework,DependencyResolverAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\refractalize_bounce\Bounce.Framework\DependencyResolverAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bounce.Framework,TaskAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\refractalize_bounce\Bounce.Framework\TaskAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Bounce.Framework,ITaskParameter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\refractalize_bounce\Bounce.Framework\TaskParameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' TypeDescription' IsRequired' DefaultValue' Type
Broken Modularization,Bounce.Framework,ITaskParameter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\refractalize_bounce\Bounce.Framework\TaskParameter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' TypeDescription' IsRequired' DefaultValue' Type
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Bounce.Framework,TypeParsers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\refractalize_bounce\Bounce.Framework\TypeParsers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Bounce.Framework.TypeParsers' Bounce.Framework.NullTypeParser
