Duplicate Abstraction,Xdgk.UI.Z,CurveItemType,C:\repos\hkiaipc_yh\8.Src\v2work\Xdgk.UI.ZedGraph\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: CurveItemType[635' 673]' CurveItemType[856' 894]
Imperative Abstraction,Xdgk.UI.Z,GraphPaneConfig,C:\repos\hkiaipc_yh\8.Src\v2work\Xdgk.UI.ZedGraph\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ConfigGraphPane
Unnecessary Abstraction,Xdgk.UI.Z,GraphPaneConfigCollection,C:\repos\hkiaipc_yh\8.Src\v2work\Xdgk.UI.ZedGraph\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Xdgk.UI.Z,GraphPaneConfigCollection,C:\repos\hkiaipc_yh\8.Src\v2work\Xdgk.UI.ZedGraph\Class1.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
