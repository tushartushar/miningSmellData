Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,GameEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\GameEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Date
Unnecessary Abstraction,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,HockeyEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\HockeyEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Number' Name' Position' Team
Unnecessary Abstraction,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,PersonEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\PersonEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unutilized Abstraction,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,TestFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\TestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,HockeyEntity,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\HockeyEntity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Number' Name' Position' Team
Insufficient Modularization,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,TestFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\TestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 63 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,TestFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\TestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 63 methods
Insufficient Modularization,NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject,TestFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nuodb_nuodb-dotnet\NUnitEFCodeFirstTestProject\TestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 118
