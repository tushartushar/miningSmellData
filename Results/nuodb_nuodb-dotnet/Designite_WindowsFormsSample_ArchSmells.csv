Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,WindowsFormsSample,WindowsFormsSample,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: WindowsFormsSample' WindowsFormsSample.testDataSetTableAdapters,WindowsFormsSample.Form1' WindowsFormsSample.PLAYERSTableAdapter' WindowsFormsSample.testDataSetTableAdapters.testDataSet' WindowsFormsSample.testDataSetTableAdapters.PLAYERSTableAdapter
Unstable Dependency,WindowsFormsSample,WindowsFormsSample,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): WindowsFormsSample.testDataSetTableAdapters,WindowsFormsSample.SCORINGTableAdapter' WindowsFormsSample.TableAdapterManager' WindowsFormsSample.UpdateOrderOption' WindowsFormsSample.PLAYERSTableAdapter' WindowsFormsSample.TEAMSTableAdapter' WindowsFormsSample.SelfReferenceComparer
Feature Concentration,WindowsFormsSample,WindowsFormsSample.testDataSetTableAdapters,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
