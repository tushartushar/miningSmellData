Imperative Abstraction,ChraftTestClient,ClientsLauncher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chraft_c-raft\ChraftTestClient\ClientsLauncher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Resolve
Unnecessary Abstraction,ChraftTestClient.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chraft_c-raft\ChraftTestClient\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WaitInitialPositionRequest
Insufficient Modularization,ChraftTestClient,PacketHandlers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chraft_c-raft\ChraftTestClient\PacketHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ChraftTestClient,PacketHandlers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chraft_c-raft\ChraftTestClient\PacketHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ChraftTestClient,PacketHandlers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chraft_c-raft\ChraftTestClient\PacketHandlers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ChraftTestClient.PacketHandlers' ChraftTestClient.TestClient
