Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http,CultureSelectedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\CultureSelectedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Context' SelectedCulture
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http,CultureSensitiveActionFilterAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\CultureSensitiveActionFilterAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http,CultureSensitiveMessageHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Http\CultureSensitiveMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http.Extensions,RouteCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Extensions\RouteCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http.Extensions,RouteEntryCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Extensions\RouteEntryCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http.Extensions,RouteExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Extensions\RouteExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http.Extensions,HttpConfigurationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Http\Extensions\HttpConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Http.Routing,RouteDataTokenKeys,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Routing\RouteDataTokenKeys.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Actions' Controller
Insufficient Modularization,RouteLocalization.Http,RouteTranslator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\RouteTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RouteLocalization.Http,Localization,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Localization.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RouteLocalization.Http.Localization' RouteLocalization.Http.Setup.Configuration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RouteLocalization.Http,RouteTranslator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\RouteTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RouteLocalization.Http.RouteTranslator' RouteLocalization.Http.RouteTranslator<T>
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RouteLocalization.Http,Localization,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Localization.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RouteLocalization.Http.Localization' RouteLocalization.Http.Setup.Configuration' RouteLocalization.Http.RouteTranslator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RouteLocalization.Http,Localization,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Localization.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RouteLocalization.Http.Localization' RouteLocalization.Http.Setup.Configuration' RouteLocalization.Http.RouteTranslator' RouteLocalization.Http.RouteTranslator<T>
Cyclic Hierarchy,RouteLocalization.Http,RouteTranslator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\RouteTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: RouteTranslator<T>
Broken Hierarchy,RouteLocalization.Http,RouteTranslator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\RouteTranslatorGeneric.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RouteLocalization.Http.RouteTranslator
