Unnecessary Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Mvc,CultureSelectedEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\CultureSelectedEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Context' SelectedCulture
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Mvc,CultureSensitiveActionFilterAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\CultureSensitiveActionFilterAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Mvc.Extensions,RouteCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Extensions\RouteCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RouteLocalization.Mvc.Extensions,RouteEntryCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\Extensions\RouteEntryCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Insufficient Modularization,RouteLocalization.Mvc,RouteTranslator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Common\RouteTranslator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,RouteLocalization.Mvc,RouteTranslator<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Dresel_RouteLocalization\Source\RouteLocalization.Mvc\RouteTranslatorGeneric.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RouteLocalization.Mvc.RouteTranslator
