Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,AR.Drone.Avionics,AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): AR.Drone.Client.Command' AR.Drone.Client' AR.Drone.Data.Navigation,AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.FlightMode' AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.DroneClient' AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.NavigationData
Unstable Dependency,AR.Drone.Avionics,AR.Drone.Avionics.Objectives,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): AR.Drone.Avionics.Objectives.IntentObtainers,AR.Drone.Avionics.Objectives.IntentObtainer
Feature Concentration,AR.Drone.Avionics,AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Input' Type' Output]' [Limits]' [Roll]' [Pitch]' [Yaw]' [Gaz]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.75,AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.Limits' AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.Roll' AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.Pitch' AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.Yaw' AR.Drone.Avionics.Apparatus.Gaz
