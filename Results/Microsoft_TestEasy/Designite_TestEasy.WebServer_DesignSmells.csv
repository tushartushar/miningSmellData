Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Path' Content' TargetRelativePath
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestEasy.WebServer,IIisCompatibleWebServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\IIISCompatibleWebServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ServerManager
Unnecessary Abstraction,TestEasy.WebServer,WebApplicationInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\WebApplicationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' PhysicalPath' VirtualPath' RemoteVirtualPath
Unutilized Abstraction,TestEasy.WebServer,ApplicationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\ApplicationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TestEasy.WebServer,SiteExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\SiteExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TestEasy.WebServer,WebServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\WebServer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetCustomHeaders which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystem
Feature Envy,TestEasy.WebServer,WebServerIisExpress,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\WebServerIisExpress.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitializeApplicationHostConfig which is more interested in members of the type: IisExpressConfig
Broken Modularization,TestEasy.WebServer,Dependencies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.WebServer\Dependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
