Feature Envy,TestEasy.Core.Helpers,FirewallHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.Core\Helpers\FirewallHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunFirewallCommand which is more interested in members of the type: IProcessRunner
Feature Envy,TestEasy.Core.Helpers,ToolsHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.Core\Helpers\ToolsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DownloadTool which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystem
Feature Envy,TestEasy.Core.Helpers,ToolsHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.Core\Helpers\ToolsHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: WasFileModified which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystem
