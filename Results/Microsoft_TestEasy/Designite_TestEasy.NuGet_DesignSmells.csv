Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,TestEasy.NuGet,NuGetManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.NuGet\NuGetManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,TestEasy.NuGet,NuGetManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.NuGet\NuGetManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: PerformNugetAction which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystem
Feature Envy,TestEasy.NuGet,NuGetMsBuildProjectSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.NuGet\NuGetMSBuildProjectSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddFrameworkReference which is more interested in members of the type: IMSBuildProject
Feature Envy,TestEasy.NuGet,NuGetMsBuildProjectSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.NuGet\NuGetMSBuildProjectSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddReference which is more interested in members of the type: IMSBuildProject
Feature Envy,TestEasy.NuGet,NuGetWebProjectSystem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.NuGet\NuGetWebProjectSystem.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetReferenceFilesToAdd which is more interested in members of the type: IFileSystem
Broken Modularization,TestEasy.NuGet,Dependencies,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Microsoft_TestEasy\src\TestEasy.NuGet\Dependencies.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
