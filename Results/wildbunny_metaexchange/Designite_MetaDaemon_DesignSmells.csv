Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaDaemon,AddressOrAccountName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_text' m_isAddress
Unutilized Abstraction,MetaDaemon,AddressOrAccountName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaDaemon,IDummyDaemon,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\MetaDaemonApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,MetaDaemon.Markets,MarketBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\Markets\MarketBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SendBitAssets which is more interested in members of the type: BitsharesWallet
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaDaemon,AddressOrAccountName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_text' m_isAddress
Insufficient Modularization,MetaDaemon,DaemonMySql,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonMySql.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MetaDaemon,MetaDaemonApi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\Api.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MetaDaemon.MetaDaemonApi' MetaDaemon.Markets.MarketBase
