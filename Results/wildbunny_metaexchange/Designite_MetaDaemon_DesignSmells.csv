Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaDaemon,AddressOrAccountName,C:\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_text' m_isAddress
Unutilized Abstraction,MetaDaemon,AddressOrAccountName,C:\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaDaemon,IDummyDaemon,C:\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\MetaDaemonApi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaDaemon,AddressOrAccountName,C:\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaDaemon\DaemonBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
