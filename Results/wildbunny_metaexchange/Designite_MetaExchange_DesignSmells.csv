Unutilized Abstraction,MetaExchange,Pair<T1;T2>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\FeeReporting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MetaExchange,MetaWebServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MetaServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaExchange,IDummy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MySqlLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_database
Unutilized Abstraction,MetaExchange,MysqlAuthenticator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MySqlLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaExchange,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' kWebRoot' kSharedJsListName' kUpdateTimeoutSeconds
Feature Envy,MetaExchange,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Main which is more interested in members of the type: MetaServer
Feature Envy,MetaExchange,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnServerException which is more interested in members of the type: MetaServer
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaExchange.Pages,DocParam,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Pages\ApiPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' name' type' description
Imperative Abstraction,MetaExchange.Pages,MainPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Pages\MainPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Render
Imperative Abstraction,MetaExchange.Pages,MarketsPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Pages\MarketsPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Render
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaExchange,MetaServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\FeeReporting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ExceptionEvent
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaExchange,IDummy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MySqlLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_database
Rebellious Hierarchy,MetaExchange,MysqlAuthenticator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\MySqlLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PostAuthorise
Unfactored Hierarchy,MetaExchange.Pages,MainPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Pages\MainPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  MainPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Pages\MainPage.cs' [283' 314])' MarketsPage (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wildbunny_metaexchange\Pages\MarketsPage.cs' [89' 120])
