Duplicate Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,User_2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\IgnoredFieldSelectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  User_2 (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\IgnoredFieldSelectTest.cs' [16' 37])' User (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs' [16' 37])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,UserData_2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\IgnoredFieldSelectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' DataValue
Unnecessary Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,UserService_2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\IgnoredFieldSelectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' ServiceName
Unnecessary Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,User,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' CreatedDate' UserDataId' UserServiceId
Unnecessary Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,UserEx,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' CreatedDate' UserDataValue' UserServiceName
Unnecessary Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,UserData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' UserDataValue
Unnecessary Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,UserService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' ServiceName
Imperative Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,JoinTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Test
Unutilized Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,JoinTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SqlServerExpressionsTest,MainClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Broken Modularization,SqlServerExpressionsTest,User_2,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\IgnoredFieldSelectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' CreatedDate' UserDataId' UserServiceId' UserDataValue' UserServiceName
Broken Modularization,SqlServerExpressionsTest,User,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' CreatedDate' UserDataId' UserServiceId
Broken Modularization,SqlServerExpressionsTest,UserEx,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NServiceKit_NServiceKit.OrmLite\src\SqlServerExpressionsTest\JoinTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
