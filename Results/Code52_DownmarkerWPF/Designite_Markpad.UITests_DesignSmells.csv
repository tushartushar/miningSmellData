Unnecessary Abstraction,MarkPad.UITests,DocumentEditorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\DocumentEditorFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MarkPad.UITests,DocumentEditorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\DocumentEditorFacts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MarkPad.UITests,Indent,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\Indent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Spaces' Tabs
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure,MarkpadDocument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\Infrastructure\MarkpadDocument.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkpadDocument' MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkpadWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure,MarkdownEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\Infrastructure\MarkdownEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkdownEditor' MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkpadDocument' MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkpadWindow
Broken Hierarchy,MarkPad.UITests,ListFacts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\DocumentEditorFacts.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkpadUiTest
Broken Hierarchy,MarkPad.UITests,DocumentFacts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Code52_DownmarkerWPF\src\Markpad.UITests\DocumentFacts.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MarkPad.UITests.Infrastructure.MarkpadUiTest
