Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO,BinaryReaderExtensions,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\BLTEVerifier\BinaryReaderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BLTEVerifier,BLTEChunkInfo,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\BLTEVerifier\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' isFullChunk' inFileSize' actualSize' checkSum' mode
Deficient Encapsulation,BLTEVerifier,BLTEChunkInfo,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\BLTEVerifier\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: isFullChunk' inFileSize' actualSize' checkSum' mode
Broken Modularization,BLTEVerifier,BLTEChunkInfo,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\BLTEVerifier\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' isFullChunk' inFileSize' actualSize' checkSum' mode
