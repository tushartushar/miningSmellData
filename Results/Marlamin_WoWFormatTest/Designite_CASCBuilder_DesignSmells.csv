Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO,BinaryReaderExtensions,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\CASCBuilder\BinaryReaderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,CASCBuilder,EncodingFileEntry,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\CASCBuilder\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' keyCount' size' hash' key

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' isFullChunk' inFileSize' actualSize' checkSum
Deficient Encapsulation,CASCBuilder,EncodingFileEntry,C:\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\CASCBuilder\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: keyCount' size' hash' key
