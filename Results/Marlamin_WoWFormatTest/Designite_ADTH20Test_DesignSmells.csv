Imperative Abstraction,ADTH20Test,ADTExporter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\ADTH20Test\ADTExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExportADT
Unnecessary Abstraction,ADTH20Test,RenderBatch,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\ADTH20Test\ADTExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' firstFace' materialID' numFaces' groupID' blendType
Unnecessary Abstraction,ADTH20Test,Vertex,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\ADTH20Test\ADTExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Position' Normal' TexCoord' Color
Unnecessary Abstraction,ADTH20Test,Vector3D,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Marlamin_WoWFormatTest\ADTH20Test\ADTExporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' X' Y' Z
