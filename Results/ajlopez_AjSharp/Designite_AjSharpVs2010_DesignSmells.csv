Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,AjSharp.Compiler,ExpectedTokenException,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\ExpectedTokenException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,AjSharp.Compiler,Lexer,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\Lexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Unutilized Abstraction,AjSharp.Compiler,NameExpectedException,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\NameExpectedException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,AjSharp.Compiler,Parser,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Parser[828' 857]' Parser[867' 896]
Unnecessary Abstraction,AjSharp.Compiler,Token,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\Token.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' TokenType
Unutilized Abstraction,AjSharp.Templates,Preprocessor,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Templates\Preprocessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexloited Encapsulation,AjSharp.Compiler,Parser,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ExpressionCommand' CompositeCommand (in method "ParseHostedCommand" of class "Parser").
Insufficient Modularization,AjSharp.Compiler,Parser,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 44 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AjSharp.Compiler,Parser,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\Compiler\Parser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 154
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AjSharp,AjSharpMachine,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\AjSharpMachine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AjSharpMachine' Host
Broken Hierarchy,AjSharp,AjSharpMachine,C:\repos\ajlopez_AjSharp\Src\AjSharp\AjSharpMachine.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Machine
