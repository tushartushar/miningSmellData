Unstable Dependency,Snowflake.Framework.Utility,Snowflake.Utility,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Snowflake.Utility.Hash,Snowflake.Utility.Crc32' Snowflake.Utility.MD5' Snowflake.Utility.SHA1
Feature Concentration,Snowflake.Framework.Utility,Snowflake.Utility,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ControllerElementExtensions]' [EnumerableExtensions]' [FileHash]' [GuidUtility]' [Instantiate]' [PathUtility]' [PropertyInfoExtensions]' [SeedBuilder]' [StringComparisonExtensions]' [StringEncode]' [TypeExtensions]' [WebClient]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1,Snowflake.Utility.EnumerableExtensions' Snowflake.Utility.FileHash' Snowflake.Utility.GuidUtility' Snowflake.Utility.Instantiate' Snowflake.Utility.PathUtility' Snowflake.Utility.PropertyInfoExtensions' Snowflake.Utility.SeedBuilder' Snowflake.Utility.StringComparisonExtensions' Snowflake.Utility.StringEncode' Snowflake.Utility.TypeExtensions' Snowflake.Utility.WebClient
