Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestBasicChunking which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestChunkSkippingSmall which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type.

Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestChunkNesting which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestChunkNestingComplex which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestChunkNestingCompletely which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestChunkNestingRandom which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestStreamEndChunkBoundary which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Feature Envy,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestStreamEndChunkBoundaryData which is more interested in members of the type: IBitStream
Insufficient Modularization,Testing,TestBitstreams,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\TestBitstreams.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Testing,AwkwardStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\moritzuehling_DemoInfo-public\Testing\AwkwardStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
