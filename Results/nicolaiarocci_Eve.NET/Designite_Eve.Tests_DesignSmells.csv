Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eve.Tests,BaseClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\BaseClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UniqueId' ETag' Updated' Created' Deleted
Unutilized Abstraction,Eve.Tests,BasicAuthenticator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\BasicAuthenticator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Eve.Tests,Company,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\Company.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Password' StateOrProvince
Feature Envy,Eve.Tests,Delete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\Delete.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: DeleteEndpointContentUsingResourceName which is more interested in members of the type: EveClient
Feature Envy,Eve.Tests,Delete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\Delete.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BaseAddressPropertyNullExceptionAlt which is more interested in members of the type: EveClient
Feature Envy,Eve.Tests,GetSingle,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\GetSingle.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BaseAddressNullException which is more interested in members of the type: EveClient
Feature Envy,Eve.Tests,GetMany,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\GetMany.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UseResourceNameConsiderIms which is more interested in members of the type: EveClient
Feature Envy,Eve.Tests,GetMany,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\GetMany.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AcceptEndpointConsiderImsAndSoftDeleteAndQuery which is more interested in members of the type: EveClient
Broken Modularization,Eve.Tests,BaseClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\BaseClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: UniqueId' ETag' Updated' Created' Deleted
Broken Hierarchy,Eve.Tests,Delete,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\Delete.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eve.Tests.MethodsBase
Broken Hierarchy,Eve.Tests,GetSingle,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\GetSingle.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eve.Tests.MethodsBase
Broken Hierarchy,Eve.Tests,GetMany,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\GetMany.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eve.Tests.MethodsBase
Broken Hierarchy,Eve.Tests,Post,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\Post.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eve.Tests.MethodsBase
Broken Hierarchy,Eve.Tests,Put,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nicolaiarocci_Eve.NET\Eve.Tests\Put.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Eve.Tests.MethodsBase
