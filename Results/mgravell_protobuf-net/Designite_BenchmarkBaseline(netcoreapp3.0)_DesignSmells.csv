Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,protoc,MyReflection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MyReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs' [503' 523])' MyReflection (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs' [990' 1010])
Duplicate Abstraction,protoc,Database,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: protoc.Database' protogen.Database
Duplicate Abstraction,protoc,Order,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: protoc.Order' protogen.Order
Duplicate Abstraction,protoc,OrderLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: protoc.OrderLine' protogen.OrderLine
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmark,DeserializeBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\DeserializeBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmark,ParseVarint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\ParseVarint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Benchmark,SerializeBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\SerializeBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,protoc,Order,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\src\Benchmark\Codegen\protoc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 111
