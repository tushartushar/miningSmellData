Unnecessary Abstraction,SO11895998,Foo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\SO11895998_Portable\DTOs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Unnecessary Abstraction,SO11895998,Bar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\SO11895998_Portable\DTOs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SO11895998,Foo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\SO11895998_Portable\DTOs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SO11895998.Foo' SO11895998.Bar
Cyclic Hierarchy,SO11895998,Foo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\SO11895998_Portable\DTOs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Bar
