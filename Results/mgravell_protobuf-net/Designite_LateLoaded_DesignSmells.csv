Unnecessary Abstraction,LateLoaded,Foo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\LateLoaded\FooBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BaseProp
Unnecessary Abstraction,LateLoaded,Bar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\LateLoaded\FooBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ChildProp
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LateLoaded,Foo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\LateLoaded\FooBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LateLoaded.Foo' LateLoaded.Bar
Cyclic Hierarchy,LateLoaded,Foo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mgravell_protobuf-net\assorted\LateLoaded\FooBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Bar
