Rebellious Hierarchy,BambooServices,BambooWatcher,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\BambooWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StopWatching' Dispose
Broken Hierarchy,BambooServices,BambooBuildStatus,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\BambooBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SirenOfShame.Lib.Watcher.BuildStatus
