Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BambooServices,BambooCIEntryPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\BambooCIEntryPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BambooServices.BambooCIEntryPoint' BambooServices.BambooWatcher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BambooServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureBamboo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureBamboo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BambooServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureBamboo' BambooServices.BambooCIEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BambooServices,BambooWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\BambooWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BambooServices.BambooWatcher' BambooServices.BambooCIEntryPoint' BambooServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureBamboo
Rebellious Hierarchy,BambooServices,BambooWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\BambooWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StopWatching' Dispose
Broken Hierarchy,BambooServices,BambooBuildStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BambooServices\BambooBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SirenOfShame.Lib.Watcher.BuildStatus
