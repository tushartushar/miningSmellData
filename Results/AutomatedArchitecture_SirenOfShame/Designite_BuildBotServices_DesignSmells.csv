Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildBotServices,BuildStatusInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartedTime' FinishedTime' LastBuildStatusEnum
Broken Modularization,BuildBotServices,BuildBotBuildersJSONQuery,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotBuildDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BaseDir' CachedBuilds' Category' CurrentBuilds' Schedulers' Slaves' State
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BuildBotServices,BuildBotCIEntryPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotCIEntryPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BuildBotServices.BuildBotCIEntryPoint' BuildBotServices.BuildBotWatcher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BuildBotServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureBuildBot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureBuildBot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BuildBotServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureBuildBot' BuildBotServices.BuildBotCIEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,BuildBotServices,BuildBotWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BuildBotServices.BuildBotWatcher' BuildBotServices.BuildBotCIEntryPoint' BuildBotServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureBuildBot
Broken Hierarchy,BuildBotServices,BuildBotBuildStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SirenOfShame.Lib.Watcher.BuildStatus
Rebellious Hierarchy,BuildBotServices,DynamicJsonConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Serialize
Rebellious Hierarchy,BuildBotServices,BuildBotWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\BuildBotServices\BuildBotWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StopWatching' Dispose
