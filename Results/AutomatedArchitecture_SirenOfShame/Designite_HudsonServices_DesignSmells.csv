Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HudsonServices,HudsonBuildStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\HudsonServices\HudsonBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HudsonServices.HudsonBuildStatus' HudsonServices.HudsonService
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HudsonServices,HudsonCIEntryPoint,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\HudsonServices\HudsonCIEntryPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HudsonServices.HudsonCIEntryPoint' HudsonServices.HudsonWatcher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HudsonServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureHudson,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\HudsonServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureHudson.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HudsonServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureHudson' HudsonServices.HudsonCIEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,HudsonServices,HudsonWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\HudsonServices\HudsonWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HudsonServices.HudsonWatcher' HudsonServices.HudsonCIEntryPoint' HudsonServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureHudson
Broken Hierarchy,HudsonServices,HudsonBuildStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\HudsonServices\HudsonBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SirenOfShame.Lib.Watcher.BuildStatus
Rebellious Hierarchy,HudsonServices,HudsonWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\HudsonServices\HudsonWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StopWatching' Dispose
