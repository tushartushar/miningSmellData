Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,MockCiServerServices,ConfigureMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\MockCiServerServices\ConfigureMock.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ProjectsAfterCheck which is more interested in members of the type: CiEntryPointSetting
Imperative Abstraction,MockCiServerServices,MockProject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\MockCiServerServices\MockProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetBuildStatus
Unutilized Abstraction,MockCiServerServices,MockProject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\MockCiServerServices\MockProject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MockCiServerServices,ConfigureMock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\MockCiServerServices\ConfigureMock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MockCiServerServices.ConfigureMock' MockCiServerServices.MockCiEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MockCiServerServices,MockWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\MockCiServerServices\MockWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MockCiServerServices.MockWatcher' MockCiServerServices.MockCiEntryPoint

Rebellious Hierarchy,MockCiServerServices,MockWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\MockCiServerServices\MockWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose
