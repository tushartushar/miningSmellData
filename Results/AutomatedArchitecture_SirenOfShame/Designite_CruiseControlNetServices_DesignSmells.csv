Unnecessary Abstraction,CruiseControlNetServices,BuildStatusInfo,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\CruiseControlNetBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartedTime' FinishedTime' LastBuildStatusEnum
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CruiseControlNetServices,CruiseControlNetWatcher,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\CruiseControlNetWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetWatcher' CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CruiseControlNetServices,CruiseControlNetWatcher,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\CruiseControlNetWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetWatcher' CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint' CruiseControlNetServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureCruiseControlNet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CruiseControlNetServices,CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint' CruiseControlNetServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureCruiseControlNet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CruiseControlNetServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureCruiseControlNet,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureCruiseControlNet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CruiseControlNetServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureCruiseControlNet' CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CruiseControlNetServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureCruiseControlNet,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureCruiseControlNet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CruiseControlNetServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureCruiseControlNet' CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetCIEntryPoint' CruiseControlNetServices.CruiseControlNetWatcher
Broken Hierarchy,CruiseControlNetServices,CruiseControlNetBuildStatus,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\CruiseControlNetBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SirenOfShame.Lib.Watcher.BuildStatus
Rebellious Hierarchy,CruiseControlNetServices,CruiseControlNetWatcher,C:\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\CruiseControlNetServices\CruiseControlNetWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StopWatching' Dispose
