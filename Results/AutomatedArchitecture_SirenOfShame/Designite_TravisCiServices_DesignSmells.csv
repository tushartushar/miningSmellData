Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,TravisCiServices.ServerConfiguration,GenerateTravisToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\ServerConfiguration\GenerateTravisToken.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ShowDialog
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TravisCiServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureTravisCi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureTravisCi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TravisCiServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureTravisCi' TravisCiServices.TravisCiEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TravisCiServices,TravisCiBuildDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\TravisCiBuildDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TravisCiServices.TravisCiBuildDefinition' TravisCiServices.TravisCiService
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TravisCiServices,TravisCiBuildStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\TravisCiBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TravisCiServices.TravisCiBuildStatus' TravisCiServices.TravisCiService
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TravisCiServices,TravisCiWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\TravisCiWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TravisCiServices.TravisCiWatcher' TravisCiServices.TravisCiEntryPoint
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TravisCiServices.ServerConfiguration,ConfigureTravisCi,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\ServerConfiguration\ConfigureTravisCi.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TravisCiServices.ServerConfiguration.ConfigureTravisCi' TravisCiServices.TravisCiEntryPoint' TravisCiServices.TravisCiWatcher
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TravisCiServices,TravisCiBuildDefinition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\TravisCiBuildDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TravisCiServices.TravisCiBuildDefinition' TravisCiServices.TravisCiBuildStatus' TravisCiServices.TravisCiService
Broken Hierarchy,TravisCiServices,TravisCiBuildStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\TravisCiBuildStatus.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SirenOfShame.Lib.Watcher.BuildStatus
Rebellious Hierarchy,TravisCiServices,TravisCiWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AutomatedArchitecture_SirenOfShame\TravisCiServices\TravisCiWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: StopWatching' Dispose
