Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,SensorTag,BleBarometerService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleBarometerService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.88
Unnecessary Abstraction,SensorTag,BatteryLevelMeasurementEventArgs,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleBatteryLevelService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BatteryLevel' Timestamp
Unutilized Abstraction,SensorTag,GattStatusException,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleGenericGattService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,SensorTag,BleGenericGattService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleGenericGattService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Multifaceted Abstraction,SensorTag,SensorTag,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\SensorTag.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.87
Deficient Encapsulation,SensorTag,BleButtonService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleButtonService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ButtonServiceUuid' ButtonCharacteristicUuid
Deficient Encapsulation,SensorTag,BleButtonService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleButtonService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ButtonServiceUuid' ButtonCharacteristicUuid
Deficient Encapsulation,SensorTag,BleIRTemperatureService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleIRTemperatureService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IRTemperatureServiceUuid
Deficient Encapsulation,SensorTag,BleIRTemperatureService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleIRTemperatureService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: IRTemperatureServiceUuid
Insufficient Modularization,SensorTag,BleGenericGattService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleGenericGattService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SensorTag,BleGenericGattService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleGenericGattService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Wide Hierarchy,SensorTag,BleGenericGattService,C:\repos\clovett_SensorTag-for-Windows\SensorTag\SensorTagLibrary\BleGenericGattService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: BleLightIntensityService' BleMovementService' BleAccelerometerService' BleBarometerService' BleBatteryLevelService' BleGyroscopeService' BleButtonService' BleHumidityService' BleIRTemperatureService' BleMagnetometerService
