Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Spine,SpineRenderer,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Rendering2D\Spine\SpineRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Draw
Multifaceted Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Spine,SpineRenderer,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Rendering2D\Spine\SpineRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Spine,SpineRenderer,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Rendering2D\Spine\SpineRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SpineRenderer' SpineSkeleton
Unfactored Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Rendering2D.Spine,AtlasData,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Rendering2D\Spine\AtlasData.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: AtlasData[9' 28]' SpineSkeletonData[9' 28]
