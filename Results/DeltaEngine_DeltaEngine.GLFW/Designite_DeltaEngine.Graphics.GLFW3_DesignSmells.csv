Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,DeltaEngine.Graphics.GLFW3,GLFW3Shader,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Graphics\GLFW3\GLFW3Shader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Insufficient Modularization,DeltaEngine.Graphics.GLFW3,GLFW3Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Graphics\GLFW3\GLFW3Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DeltaEngine.Graphics.GLFW3,GLFW3Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Graphics\GLFW3\GLFW3Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DeltaEngine.Graphics.GLFW3,GLFW3Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Graphics\GLFW3\GLFW3Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GLFW3Device' OpenGL20CircularBuffer
Rebellious Hierarchy,DeltaEngine.Graphics.GLFW3,GLFW3Device,C:\repos\DeltaEngine_DeltaEngine.GLFW\Graphics\GLFW3\GLFW3Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Dispose
