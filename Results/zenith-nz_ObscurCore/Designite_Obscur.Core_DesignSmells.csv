Missing Hierarchy,Obscur.Core.Packaging,PackageWriter,C:\repos\zenith-nz_ObscurCore\Obscur.Core\Packaging\PackageWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IDataTransferObject' SymmetricManifestCryptographyConfiguration (in method "SetManifestCryptography" of class "PackageWriter").
