Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Extensions,NancyExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Extensions\NancyExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Extensions,OwinExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Extensions\OwinExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Models,Application,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Models\Application.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ApplicationID' DisplayName' RedirectUri' LogoutRedirectUri' Secret
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Modules,AuthenticationModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Modules\AuthenticationModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Modules,AuthorizationModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Modules\AuthorizationModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Modules,HomeModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Modules\HomeModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Modules,ResourceModule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Modules\ResourceModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Nancy.Server,RazorViewEngineRegistrations,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\NancyBootstrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Nancy.Server,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Configuration
Duplicate Abstraction,Nancy.Server.Providers,AuthorizationProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Providers\AuthorizationProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AuthorizationProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Providers\AuthorizationProvider.cs' [55' 74])' AuthorizationProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Providers\AuthorizationProvider.cs' [115' 134])
Broken Modularization,Nancy.Server.Models,Application,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Models\Application.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ApplicationID' DisplayName' RedirectUri' LogoutRedirectUri' Secret
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Nancy.Server.Models,ApplicationContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet-contrib_AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server\samples\Nancy\Nancy.Server\Models\ApplicationContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Nancy.Server.Models.ApplicationContext' Nancy.Server.Models.ApplicationContextInitializer
