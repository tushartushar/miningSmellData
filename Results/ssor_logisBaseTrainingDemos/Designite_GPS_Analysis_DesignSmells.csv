Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,nsConfigDB,ConfigDB,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\ConfigDB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,GPS_Analysis,GPSA,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\GPSA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.96
Multifaceted Abstraction,GPS_Analysis,MatrixCircularProgressControl,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\MatrixCircularProgressControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Unutilized Abstraction,GPS_Analysis,MatrixCircularProgressControl,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\MatrixCircularProgressControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GPS_Analysis,NmeaInterpreterEventName,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\NmeaInterpreter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GPS_Analysis.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,GPS_Analysis,GPSA,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\GPSA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: gpsString' instring' nrthest' ellipHeight
Deficient Encapsulation,GPS_Analysis,NmeaInterpreter,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\NmeaInterpreter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NmeaCultureInfo' MPHPerKnot
Deficient Encapsulation,GPS_Analysis,NmeaInterpreter,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\NmeaInterpreter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NmeaCultureInfo' MPHPerKnot
Deficient Encapsulation,GPS_Analysis,staticClass,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\staticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: timeBase' PicturePath' currentDBConnectString' restServerIP' restServerPort' serialport_name
Deficient Encapsulation,GPS_Analysis,staticClass,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\staticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: timeBase' PicturePath' currentDBConnectString' restServerIP' restServerPort' serialport_name
Insufficient Modularization,GPS_Analysis,GPSA,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\GPSA.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Broken Modularization,GPS_Analysis,staticClass,C:\repos\ssor_logisBaseTrainingDemos\GPS_Analysis\GPS_Analysis\staticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' timeBase' PicturePath' currentDBConnectString' restServerIP' restServerPort' serialport_name
