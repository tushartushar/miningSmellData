Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCBS.DatabaseConnection,ConnectionManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\ConnectionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenCBS.DatabaseConnection,ConnectionManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\ConnectionManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConnectionManager (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\ConnectionManager.cs' [1' 21])' IConnectionManager (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\IConnectionManager.cs' [1' 21])' Standard (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\DatabaseConnection\Standard.cs' [1' 21])' UserRemotingContext (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\UserRemotingContext.cs' [1' 21])

Broken Modularization,OpenCBS.DatabaseConnection,UserRemotingContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\UserRemotingContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Token' Connection' SecondaryConnection' _token' _connection' _secondaryConnection
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenCBS.DatabaseConnection,Standard,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.ConnectionManager\DatabaseConnection\Standard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetConnection
