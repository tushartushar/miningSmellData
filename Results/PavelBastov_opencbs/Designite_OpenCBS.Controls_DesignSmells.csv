Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,AmountTextBox,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\AmountTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,AmountTextBox,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\AmountTextBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AmountTextBox (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\AmountTextBox.cs' [1' 20])' ScheduleControl (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\ScheduleControl.cs' [1' 20])
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,frmShowError,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\frmShowError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  frmShowError (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\frmShowError.cs' [1' 22])' PrintButton (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\PrintButton.cs' [1' 22])
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,frmShowError,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\frmShowError.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  frmShowError (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\frmShowError.cs' [4' 23])' ScheduleControl (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\ScheduleControl.cs' [2' 21])
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,LoaderControl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\LoaderControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,PrintButton,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\PrintButton.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadReports
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,PrintButton,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\PrintButton.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,ScheduleControl,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\ScheduleControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenCBS.Controls,SplitButton,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\SplitButton.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,OpenCBS.Controls,PrintButton,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\PrintButton.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Menu
Insufficient Modularization,OpenCBS.Controls,SplitButton,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelBastov_opencbs\Src\OpenCBS.Controls\SplitButton.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 117
