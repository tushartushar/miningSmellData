Unnecessary Abstraction,RemoteActorsSample,Rectangle,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: A' B
Unnecessary Abstraction,RemoteActorsSample,RectangleInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Field' Perimeter
Unnecessary Abstraction,RemoteActorsSample,Message,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: X' Y' Info
Imperative Abstraction,RemoteActorsSample,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,RemoteActorsSample,AddMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' x' y
Unutilized Abstraction,RemoteActorsSample,AddMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,RemoteActorsSample,AddMessage,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\RemoteActorsSample\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: x' y
