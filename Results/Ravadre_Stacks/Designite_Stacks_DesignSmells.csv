Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Stacks.Tcp,SocketServer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Server\Tcp\SocketServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Stacks,Executor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Executors\Executor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Stacks,IMessageHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Serializers\IMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Stacks.Tcp,SocketClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Client\Tcp\SocketClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Broken Hierarchy,Stacks.Tcp,MessageClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Client\Tcp\MessageClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Stacks.Tcp.MessageClientBase
Broken Hierarchy,Stacks.Tcp,ReactiveMessageClient<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Client\Tcp\ReactiveMessageClient.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Stacks.Tcp.MessageClientBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stacks.Tcp,SocketClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Client\Tcp\SocketClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Send
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stacks,RawByteClientStream,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Client\RawByteClientStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stacks,ActionBlockExecutor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Executors\ActionBlockExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Send
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stacks,CapturedContextExecutor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Executors\CapturedContextExecutor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Send
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stacks,ImperativeMessageIdCache,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\MessageClient\ImperativeMessageIdCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PreLoadTypesFromAssemblyOfType
Rebellious Hierarchy,Stacks,ProtoBufStacksSerializer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Stacks\Serializers\ProtobufStacksSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Initialize
