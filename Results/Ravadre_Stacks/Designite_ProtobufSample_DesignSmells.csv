Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ProtobufSample,Client,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\ProtobufSample\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Run which is more interested in members of the type: MessageClient
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProtobufSample,TemperatureChanged,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\ProtobufSample\Data.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: City' Temperature
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProtobufSample,TemperatureRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\ProtobufSample\Data.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: City
Unnecessary Abstraction,ProtobufSample,TemperatureResponse,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\ProtobufSample\Data.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: City' Temperature
Broken Hierarchy,ProtobufSample,ServerMessageHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\ProtobufSample\Server.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Stacks.Actors.Actor' Stacks.IMessageHandler
Broken Hierarchy,ProtobufSample,TemperatureService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Ravadre_Stacks\Examples\ProtobufSample\Server.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Stacks.Actors.Actor
