Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharedMemory,FastStructure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\SharedMemory\FastStructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharedMemory.FastStructure' SharedMemory.FastStructure<T>
Unfactored Hierarchy,SharedMemory,BufferReadWrite,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\SharedMemory\BufferReadWrite.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  BufferReadWrite (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\SharedMemory\BufferReadWrite.cs' [2' 32])' BufferWithLocks (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\SharedMemory\BufferWithLocks.cs' [2' 32])
Broken Hierarchy,SharedMemory,BufferReadWrite,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\SharedMemory\BufferReadWrite.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SharedMemory.BufferWithLocks
