Unnecessary Abstraction,CommandLine,HelpArgument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' help
Unnecessary Abstraction,CommandLine,COORD,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' x' y
Unnecessary Abstraction,CommandLine,SMALL_RECT,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Left' Top' Right' Bottom
Unnecessary Abstraction,CommandLine,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Imperative Abstraction,SingleProcess,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,SingleProcess,AppArguments,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' bufferSize' nodeCount' writers' readers' elements
Deficient Encapsulation,CommandLine,HelpArgument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: help
Deficient Encapsulation,CommandLine,ArgumentHelpStrings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: syntax' help
Deficient Encapsulation,SingleProcess,AppArguments,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: bufferSize' nodeCount' writers' readers' elements
Insufficient Modularization,CommandLine,Parser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Modularization,CommandLine,CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' dwSize' dwCursorPosition' wAttributes' srWindow' dwMaximumWindowSize
Broken Modularization,SingleProcess,AppArguments,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' bufferSize' nodeCount' writers' readers' elements
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CommandLine,ArgumentAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CommandLine.ArgumentAttribute' CommandLine.DefaultArgumentAttribute
Cyclic Hierarchy,CommandLine,ArgumentAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\spazzarama_SharedMemory\Examples\SingleProcess\CommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: DefaultArgumentAttribute
