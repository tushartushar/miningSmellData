Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,TeaTime.Benchmarks,Run,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discretelogics_TeaFiles.Net\Examples\Benchmarks\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OperationsPerSecond' N' ExecutionTime
Unutilized Abstraction,TeaTime.Benchmarks,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discretelogics_TeaFiles.Net\Examples\Benchmarks\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TeaTime.Benchmarks,ComputerSpecs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discretelogics_TeaFiles.Net\Examples\Benchmarks\ComputerSpecs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Manufacturer' Model' OperatingSystem' OperatingSystemVersion' OperatingSystemServicePack' NumberOfDisks' SystemDiskModel' NumberOfProcessors' ProcessorName' ProcessorDescription' ProcessorClockSpeedMhz' MemoryMBytes' L1KBytes' L2KBytes
Deficient Encapsulation,TeaTime.Benchmarks,Run,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discretelogics_TeaFiles.Net\Examples\Benchmarks\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: N' ExecutionTime
Deficient Encapsulation,TeaTime.Benchmarks,Runner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\discretelogics_TeaFiles.Net\Examples\Benchmarks\Runner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: N' TargetValue
