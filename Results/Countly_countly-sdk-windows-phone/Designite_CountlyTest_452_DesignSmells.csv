Deficient Encapsulation,TestProject_common,TestHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\TestHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: v' iv' bv' lv' dv' locales
Deficient Encapsulation,TestProject_common,TestHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\TestHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: v' iv' bv' lv' dv' locales
Deficient Encapsulation,TestProject_common,ThreadingTestCases,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\ThreadingTestCases.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: threadIterations
Insufficient Modularization,TestProject_common,TestHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\TestHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TestProject_common,TestingEntities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\TestingEntities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TestProject_common,TestingEntities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\TestingEntities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Broken Hierarchy,TestProject_common,LegacyInitTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Countly_countly-sdk-windows-phone\countlyCommon\TestingRelated\LegacyInitTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TestProject_common.CountlyTestCases
