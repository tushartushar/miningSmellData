Unutilized Abstraction,TechStacks.Tests,AdminTasks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\AdminTasks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TechStacks.Tests,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TechStacks.Tests,UnitTestHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\TestHosts.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  UnitTestHost (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\TestHosts.cs' [25' 49])' UnitTestHost (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\TestHosts.cs' [61' 85])
Unutilized Abstraction,TechStacks.Tests,UnitTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\UnitTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,TechStacks.Tests,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ServiceStackApps_TechStacks\src\TechStacks\TechStacks.Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
