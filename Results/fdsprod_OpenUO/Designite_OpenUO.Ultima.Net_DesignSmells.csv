Unutilized Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net.Compression,HuffmanDecompression,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\Compression\HuffmanDecompression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net.Compression,ZlibCompression,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\Compression\ZlibDecompression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net.Compression,ZlibCompression,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\Compression\ZlibDecompression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ZlibCompression (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\Compression\ZlibDecompression.cs' [246' 266])' ZlibCompression (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\Compression\ZlibDecompression.cs' [281' 301])' ZlibCompression (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\Compression\ZlibDecompression.cs' [316' 336])
Duplicate Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net,PacketReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IO\PacketReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PacketReader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IO\PacketReader.cs' [367' 390])' PacketReader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IO\PacketReader.cs' [419' 442])
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net,IRecvPacket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IRecvPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net,NetworkException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\NetworkException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Net,SocketState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\SocketState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OpenUO.Core.Net,PacketReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IO\PacketReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,OpenUO.Core.Net,PacketReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IO\PacketReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,OpenUO.Core.Net,PacketWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Network\IO\PacketWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
