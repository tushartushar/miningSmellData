Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ParadoxUO,IClient,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Container
Unutilized Abstraction,ParadoxUO,RenderScript,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Client.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Configuration,MacroActions,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Configuration\MacroActions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OpenUO.Core.Configuration,MacroSettings,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Configuration\MacroSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Macro' Sectionname' _macro
Duplicate Abstraction,ParadoxUO.Net,NetworkClient,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Net\NetworkClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  NetworkClient (C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Net\NetworkClient.cs' [436' 458])' NetworkClient (C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Net\NetworkClient.cs' [501' 523])
Deficient Encapsulation,ParadoxUO.Net,QueuedPacket,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Net\QueuedPacket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' PacketBuffer' PacketHandlers' RealLength
Broken Modularization,OpenUO.Core.Configuration,DebugSettings,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Configuration\DebugSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TracePerformance' LogPackets' ShowUiOutlines' ShowDataReadBreakdown' ShowDataRead' ShowFps' IsConsoleEnabled' SectionName' _isConsoleEnabled' _logPackets' _showDataRead' _showDataReadBreakdown' _showFps' _showUiOutlines' _tracePerformance
Rebellious Hierarchy,ParadoxUO,ParadoxUOCoreModule,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\ParadoxUOCoreModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnUnload
Broken Hierarchy,OpenUO.Core.Configuration,Mouse,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Configuration\Mouse.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OpenUO.Core.ComponentModel.NotifiableBase
Broken Hierarchy,OpenUO.Core.Configuration,Resolution,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\ParadoxUO\ParadoxUO.Windows\Configuration\Resolution.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OpenUO.Core.ComponentModel.NotifiableBase
