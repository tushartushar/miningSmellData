Broken Hierarchy,OpenUO.Ultima.Paradox3d.Adapters,Paradox3dStorageAdapterBase,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Paradox3d\Adapters\Paradox3dStorageAdapterBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OpenUO.Ultima.Adapters.StorageAdapterBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,OpenUO.Ultima.Paradox3d,OpenUOParadox3dModule,C:\repos\fdsprod_OpenUO\OpenUO.Ultima.Paradox3d\OpenUOParadox3dModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnUnload
