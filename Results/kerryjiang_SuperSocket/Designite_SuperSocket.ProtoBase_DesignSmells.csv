Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.ProtoBase,FilterResult,C:\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.ProtoBase\FilterResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: State
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.ProtoBase,FilterResult,C:\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.ProtoBase\FilterResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
