Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket,HostBuilderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\HostBuilderExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket,IHostBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\IHostBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket,IServerInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\IServerInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' DataContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket,ServerOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\ServerOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Listeners
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket,SessionContainerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\SessionContainerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket,TaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,SuperSocket,MiddlewareBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Primitives\MiddlewareBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Register' HandleSession
