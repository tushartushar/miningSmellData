Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,HandshakeOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\HandshakeOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CheckingInterval' OpenHandshakeTimeOut' CloseHandshakeTimeOut
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,IWebSocketCommandMiddleware,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketCommandMiddleware.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,IWebSocketHostBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketHostBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,InternalWebSocketHostBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketHostBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,WebSocketHostBuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketHostBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,WebSocketPackageHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketPackageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Handle
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket,WebSocketServerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketServerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server,WebSocketSession,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.WebSocket.Server\WebSocketSession.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SuperSocket.Server.AppSession
