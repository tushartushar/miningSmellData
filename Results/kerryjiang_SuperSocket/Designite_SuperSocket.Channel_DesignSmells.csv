Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.Channel,ChannelOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\ChannelOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxPackageLength' ReceiveBufferSize' Logger' In' Out
Unnecessary Abstraction,SuperSocket.Channel,IPipeChannel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\IPipeChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: In' Out' PipelineFilter
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.Channel,RelayPipeChannel<TPackageInfo>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\RelayPipeChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.Channel,StreamPipeChannel<TPackageInfo>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\StreamPipeChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SuperSocket.Channel,TcpPipeChannel<TPackageInfo>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\TcpPipeChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,SuperSocket.Channel,ChannelOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\ChannelOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxPackageLength' ReceiveBufferSize' Logger' In' Out
Rebellious Hierarchy,SuperSocket.Channel,ChannelBase<TPackageInfo>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\ChannelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RunAsync' SendAsync' SendAsync' Close
Rebellious Hierarchy,SuperSocket.Channel,RelayPipeChannel<TPackageInfo>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kerryjiang_SuperSocket\src\SuperSocket.Channel\RelayPipeChannel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FillPipeWithDataAsync
