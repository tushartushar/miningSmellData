Unutilized Abstraction,Tattle,Tattle,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Tattle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Tattle.Provider,DbDataReaderTattler,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Provider\DbDataReaderTattler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.8
Unutilized Abstraction,Tattle.Extensions,IEnumerableExtensions,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Extensions\IEnumerableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tattle,Tattle,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Tattle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Tattlers' IsProviderConfigured
Deficient Encapsulation,Tattle,Tattle,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Tattle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Tattlers' IsProviderConfigured
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tattle.Provider,DbCommandTattler,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Provider\DbCommandTattler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DbCommandTattler' DbConnectionTattler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tattle.Provider,DbCommandTattler,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Provider\DbCommandTattler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DbCommandTattler' DbConnectionTattler' DbTransactionTattler' DbConnectionTattler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Tattle.Provider,DbConnectionTattler,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Provider\DbConnectionTattler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DbConnectionTattler' DbTransactionTattler
Insufficient Modularization,Tattle.Provider,DbDataReaderTattler,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Provider\DbDataReaderTattler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Tattle.Provider,DbDataReaderTattler,C:\repos\choudeshell_Tattle\Tattle\Provider\DbDataReaderTattler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
