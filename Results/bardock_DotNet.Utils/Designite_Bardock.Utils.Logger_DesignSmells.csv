Unnecessary Abstraction,Bardock.Utils.Logger,ConfigSection,C:\repos\bardock_DotNet.Utils\src\Bardock.Utils.Logger\ConfigSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' LogFactory
Unutilized Abstraction,Bardock.Utils.Logger,ConfigSection,C:\repos\bardock_DotNet.Utils\src\Bardock.Utils.Logger\ConfigSection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Bardock.Utils.Logger.Extensions,ILogExtensions,C:\repos\bardock_DotNet.Utils\src\Bardock.Utils.Logger\Extensions\ILogExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Bardock.Utils.Logger,NullLog,C:\repos\bardock_DotNet.Utils\src\Bardock.Utils.Logger\NullLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Bardock.Utils.Logger,NullLog,C:\repos\bardock_DotNet.Utils\src\Bardock.Utils.Logger\NullLog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Debug' Debug' DebugFormat' DebugFormat' Error' Error' ErrorFormat' ErrorFormat' Fatal' Fatal' FatalFormat' FatalFormat' Info' Info' InfoFormat' InfoFormat' Warn' Warn' WarnFormat' WarnFormat
