Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Bardock.Utils.Data.EF,Bardock.Utils.Data.EF,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Bardock.Utils.Data.EF' Bardock.Utils.Data.EF.Operations
Unstable Dependency,Bardock.Utils.Data.EF,Bardock.Utils.Data.EF.Operations,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Bardock.Utils.Data.EF
Feature Concentration,Bardock.Utils.Data.EF,Bardock.Utils.Data.EF.Operations,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [EntityAdder' IEntityAdder]' [EntityDetacher' IEntityDetacher]' [EntityDeleter' IEntityDeleter]' [EntityUpdater' IEntityUpdater]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
