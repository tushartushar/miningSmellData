Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Feeds,FeedBuilderMatch,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Feeds.Abstractions\IFeedBuilderProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Priority' FeedBuilder
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Feeds,IFeedQueryProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Feeds.Abstractions\IFeedQueryProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
