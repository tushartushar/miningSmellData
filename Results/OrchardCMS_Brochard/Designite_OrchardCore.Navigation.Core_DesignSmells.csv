Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationHelper,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationManager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: BuildMenuAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,Pager,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\Pager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,PagerParameters,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\PagerParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Page' PageSize
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,PagerSlimParameters,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\SafePageParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Before' After
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,PagerSlim,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\SafePager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Navigation,ServiceCollectionExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AdminMenuContentPosition' AdminMenuDesignPosition' AdminMenuSearchPosition' AdminMenuSecurityPosition' AdminMenuWorkflowsPosition' AdminMenuConfigurationPosition
Insufficient Modularization,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationItemBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationItemBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OrchardCore.Navigation.NavigationBuilder' OrchardCore.Navigation.NavigationItemBuilder
Wide Hierarchy,OrchardCore.Navigation,INavigationProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\INavigationProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: OrchardCore.AdminMenu.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.AdminMenu.Services.AdminMenuNavigationProvidersCoordinator' OrchardCore.Apis.GraphQL.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.BackgroundTasks.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.ContentTypes.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.CustomSettings.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Demo.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Deployment.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Deployment.Remote.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Email.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Facebook.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Facebook.AdminMenuLogin' OrchardCore.Features.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.GitHub.AdminMenuGitHubLogin' OrchardCore.Google.GoogleAuthenticationAdminMenu' OrchardCore.Google.GoogleAnalyticsAdminMenu' OrchardCore.Https.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Layers.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Lucene.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Media.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Media.MediaCacheAdminMenu' OrchardCore.Microsoft.Authentication.AdminMenuMicrosoftAccount' OrchardCore.Microsoft.Authentication.AdminMenuAAD' OrchardCore.OpenId.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Queries.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Queries.Sql.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.ReCaptcha.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.ReverseProxy.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Roles.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Settings.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Templates.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Templates.AdminTemplatesAdminMenu' OrchardCore.Tenants.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Themes.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Twitter.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Twitter.AdminMenuSignin' OrchardCore.Users.AdminMenu' OrchardCore.Users.RegistrationAdminMenu' OrchardCore.Users.ResetPasswordAdminMenu' OrchardCore.Workflows.AdminMenu
Cyclic Hierarchy,OrchardCore.Navigation,NavigationBuilder,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.Navigation.Core\NavigationBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: NavigationItemBuilder
