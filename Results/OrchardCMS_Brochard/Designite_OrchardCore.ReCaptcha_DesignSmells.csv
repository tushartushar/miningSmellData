Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.ReCaptcha,Startup,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.ReCaptcha\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OrchardCore.ReCaptcha,Startup,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.ReCaptcha\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: OrchardCore.ReCaptcha.Startup' OrchardCore.ReCaptcha.Forms.Startup' OrchardCore.ReCaptcha.Workflows.Startup
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.ReCaptcha,StartupUsers,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.ReCaptcha\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,OrchardCore.ReCaptcha.Forms,Migrations,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.ReCaptcha\Forms\Migrations.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Create which is more interested in members of the type: IContentDefinitionManager
