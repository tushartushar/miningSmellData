Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.XmlRpc,IXmlRpcHandler,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Abstractions\IXmlRpcHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Models,XRpcMethodCall,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Abstractions\Models\XRpcMethodCall.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MethodName' Params
Deficient Encapsulation,OrchardCore.XmlRpc,XmlRpcContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Abstractions\XmlRpcContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Drivers
Broken Modularization,OrchardCore.XmlRpc,XmlRpcContext,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Abstractions\XmlRpcContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ControllerContext' HttpContext' Url' RpcMethodCall' RpcMethodResponse' Drivers
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Models,XRpcData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Abstractions\Models\XRpcData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Models.XRpcData' OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Models.XRpcData<T>
Cyclic Hierarchy,OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Models,XRpcData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore\OrchardCore.XmlRpc.Abstractions\Models\XRpcData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: XRpcData<T>
