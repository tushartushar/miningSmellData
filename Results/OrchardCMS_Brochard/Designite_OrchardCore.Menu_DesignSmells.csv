Unutilized Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.GraphQL,Startup,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\GraphQL\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.GraphQL,Startup,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\GraphQL\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: OrchardCore.Menu.GraphQL.Startup' OrchardCore.Menu.Startup
Imperative Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu,MenuShapes,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\MenuShapes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Discover

Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.Models,LinkMenuItemPart,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\Models\LinkMenuItemPart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Url
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.Models,MenuItemsListPart,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\Models\MenuItemsListPart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MenuItems
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.Models,MenuPart,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\Models\MenuPart.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.ViewModels,LinkMenuItemPartEditViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\ViewModels\LinkMenuItemPartEditViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Url' MenuItemPart
Unnecessary Abstraction,OrchardCore.Menu.ViewModels,MenuPartEditViewModel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\OrchardCMS_Brochard\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Menu\ViewModels\MenuPartEditViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
