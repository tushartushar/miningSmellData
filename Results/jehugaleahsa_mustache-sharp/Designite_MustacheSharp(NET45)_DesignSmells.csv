Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Mustache,HtmlFormatCompiler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\HtmlFormatCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Mustache,HtmlFormatCompiler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\HtmlFormatCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HtmlFormatCompiler which is more interested in members of the type: FormatCompiler
Duplicate Abstraction,Mustache,PropertyDictionary,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\PropertyDictionary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PropertyDictionary (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\PropertyDictionary.cs' [185' 206])' UpcastDictionary (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\UpcastDictionary.cs' [147' 168])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mustache,Substitution,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\Substitution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key' Substitute' IsExtension
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mustache,ValueRequestEventArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\ValueRequestEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Broken Modularization,Mustache,SearchResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jehugaleahsa_mustache-sharp\MustacheSharp\Scope.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Lookup' Members' MemberIndex' Member' Found' Value
