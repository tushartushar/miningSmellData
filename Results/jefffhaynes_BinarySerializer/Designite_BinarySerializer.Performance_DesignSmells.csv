Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BinarySerializer.Performance,BasicClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jefffhaynes_BinarySerializer\BinarySerializer.Performance\BasicClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ByteValue' ShortValue' IntValue' StringValue
Unutilized Abstraction,BinarySerializer.Performance,BasicClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jefffhaynes_BinarySerializer\BinarySerializer.Performance\BasicClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BinarySerializer.Performance,SortContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jefffhaynes_BinarySerializer\BinarySerializer.Performance\Beer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NameLength' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,BinarySerializer.Performance,Beer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jefffhaynes_BinarySerializer\BinarySerializer.Performance\Beer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Brand' SortCount' Sort' Alcohol' Brewery
