Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetKoans.CSharp,Widget,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutGenericContainers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetKoans.CSharp,Widget,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutGenericContainers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetKoans.CSharp,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetKoans.CSharp,PathToEnlightenment,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\PathToEnlightenment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ThePath
Unexploited Encapsulation,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutControlStatements,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutControlStatements.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: AboutControlStatements' AboutMethods (in method "IsOperators" of class "AboutControlStatements").
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutDelegates,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutDelegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutDelegates,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutDelegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 35 methods
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutGenericContainers,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutGenericContainers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutStrings,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutStrings,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Missing Hierarchy,DotNetKoans.CSharp,AboutControlStatements,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutControlStatements.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Koan' AboutControlStatements (in method "IsOperators" of class "AboutControlStatements").
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetKoans.CSharp,ReallyYippyChihuahua,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutInheritance.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DotNetKoans.CSharp.Chihuahua
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetKoans.CSharp,GreatDane,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutInheritance.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DotNetKoans.CSharp.Dog
Broken Hierarchy,DotNetKoans.CSharp,StateSecret,C:\repos\CoryFoy_DotNetKoans\CSharp\AboutMethods.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DotNetKoans.CSharp.InnerSecret
