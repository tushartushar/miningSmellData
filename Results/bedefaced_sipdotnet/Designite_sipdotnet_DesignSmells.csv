Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,sipdotnet,Phone,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Phone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,sipdotnet,LCSipTransports,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Linphone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' udp_port' tcp_port' dtls_port' tls_port
Deficient Encapsulation,sipdotnet,LCSipTransports,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Linphone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: udp_port' tcp_port' dtls_port' tls_port
Deficient Encapsulation,sipdotnet,LinphoneCoreVTable,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Linphone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: global_state_changed' registration_state_changed' call_state_changed' notify_presence_received' notify_presence_received_for_uri_or_tel' new_subscription_requested' auth_info_requested' authentication_requested' call_log_updated' message_received' message_received_unable_decrypt' is_composing_received' dtmf_received' refer_received' call_encryption_changed' transfer_state_changed' buddy_info_updated' call_stats_updated' info_received' subscription_state_changed' notify_received' publish_state_changed' configuring_status' display_status' display_message' display_warning' display_url' show' text_received' file_transfer_recv' file_transfer_send' file_transfer_progress_indication' network_reachable' log_collection_upload_state_changed' log_collection_upload_progress_indication' friend_list_created' friend_list_removed' user_data
Insufficient Modularization,sipdotnet,Linphone,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Linphone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 58 methods
Broken Modularization,sipdotnet,LinphoneCoreVTable,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Linphone.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' global_state_changed' registration_state_changed' call_state_changed' notify_presence_received' notify_presence_received_for_uri_or_tel' new_subscription_requested' auth_info_requested' authentication_requested' call_log_updated' message_received' message_received_unable_decrypt' is_composing_received' dtmf_received' refer_received' call_encryption_changed' transfer_state_changed' buddy_info_updated' call_stats_updated' info_received' subscription_state_changed' notify_received' publish_state_changed' configuring_status' display_status' display_message' display_warning' display_url' show' text_received' file_transfer_recv' file_transfer_send' file_transfer_progress_indication' network_reachable' log_collection_upload_state_changed' log_collection_upload_progress_indication' friend_list_created' friend_list_removed' user_data
Broken Hierarchy,sipdotnet,LinphoneCall,C:\repos\bedefaced_sipdotnet\Linphone.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): sipdotnet.Call
