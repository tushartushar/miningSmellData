Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,InvalidRegistrationException,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Exception\InvalidRegistrationException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,ExpressionExtensions,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Helpers\ExpressionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,ExpressionRegistrationExtensions,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Registration\ExpressionRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,IExpressionRegistration,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Registration\IExpressionRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CompileMode' Expression' Resolver
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,ILifetimeRegistration,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Registration\ILifetimeRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Lifetime
Unutilized Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,InstanceRegistration<T>,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Registration\InstanceRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,LifetimeRegistrationExtensions,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Registration\LifetimeRegistrationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc,ResolverExtensions,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\ResolverExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc.Compiler,ExpressionCompilerVisitor,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Compiler\ExpressionCompilerVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Compile
Unnecessary Abstraction,Dynamo.Ioc.Index,IIndex,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Index\IIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unexploited Encapsulation,Dynamo.Ioc.Compiler,ExpressionCompilerVisitor,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Compiler\ExpressionCompilerVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: TransientLifetime' ContainerLifetime (in method "CompileRegistrationIntoExpression" of class "ExpressionCompilerVisitor").
Insufficient Modularization,Dynamo.Ioc,IocContainer,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\IocContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dynamo.Ioc.Index,DirectIndex,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Index\DirectIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Dynamo.Ioc.Index,GroupedIndex,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Index\GroupedIndex.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Dynamo.Ioc,RegistrationBase<T>,C:\repos\MartinF_Dynamo.IoC\Dynamo.Ioc\Registration\RegistrationBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetInstance' Verify
