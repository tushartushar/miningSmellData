Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration.DbDeployConfigurationManager' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration.DbDeployDefaults' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Controller' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.DbDeployer
Unstable Dependency,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration.OutputFileEncoding' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Configuration.UniqueChange
Ambiguous Interface,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Exceptions,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: UsageException,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Exceptions.UsageException
Feature Concentration,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Controller' UniqueChange' DbDeployer' IAppliedChangesProvider' IAvailableChangeScriptsProvider' IChangeScriptApplier' PrettyPrinter]' [OutputFileEncoding]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.OutputFileEncoding
Scattered Functionality,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Appliers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Database.SqlCmd' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Database,Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Database.SqlCmd.SqlCmdExecutor' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Database.IDbmsSyntax' Net.Sf.Dbdeploy.Database.DatabaseSchemaVersionManager
