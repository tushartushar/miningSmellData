Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Switchboard.Server,Switchboard.Server.Connection,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Switchboard.Server.Connection' Switchboard.Server,Switchboard.Server.Connection.OutboundConnection' Switchboard.Server.SwitchboardRequestParser' Switchboard.Server.SwitchboardResponseParser
Unstable Dependency,Switchboard.Server,Switchboard.Server,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Switchboard.Server.Connection,Switchboard.Server.InboundConnection' Switchboard.Server.OutboundConnection
Feature Concentration,Switchboard.Server,Switchboard.Server.Utils,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ChunkedStream]' [MaxReadStream' EmptyAsyncResult' RedirectingStream]' [StartAvailableStream]' [VoidTypeStruct]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67,Switchboard.Server.Utils.ChunkedStream' Switchboard.Server.Utils.StartAvailableStream' Switchboard.Server.Utils.VoidTypeStruct
