Unnecessary Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Connection,SwitchboardConnection,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Connection\SwitchboardConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsSecure
Unutilized Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Extensions,TaskExtensions,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Extensions\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Utils,EmptyAsyncResult,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\MaxReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AsyncState' AsyncWaitHandle' CompletedSynchronously' IsCompleted
Unutilized Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Utils,StartAvailableStream,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\StartAvailableStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Utils,VoidTypeStruct,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\VoidTypeStruct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Utils,VoidTypeStruct,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\VoidTypeStruct.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Switchboard.Server.Utils.HttpParser,HttpResponseParser,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\HttpParser\HttpResponseParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Deficient Encapsulation,Switchboard.Server.Connection,InboundConnection,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Connection\InboundConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ConnectionId
Deficient Encapsulation,Switchboard.Server,ParseDelegate,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Request\SwitchboardRequestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: request' requestBodyStart' complete' headerComplete' headerComplete' response' responseBodyStart
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Switchboard.Server.Connection,InboundConnection,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Connection\InboundConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Switchboard.Server.Connection.InboundConnection' Switchboard.Server.SwitchboardRequestParser
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Switchboard.Server,SwitchboardRequestParser,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Request\SwitchboardRequestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Switchboard.Server.SwitchboardRequestParser' Switchboard.Server.Connection.InboundConnection
Insufficient Modularization,Switchboard.Server.Utils,RedirectingStream,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\RedirectingStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Switchboard.Server,ParseDelegate,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Request\SwitchboardRequestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnResponseBegin' OnEntityStart' OnEntityEnd' OnResponseEnd
Rebellious Hierarchy,Switchboard.Server.Utils,ChunkedStream,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\ChunkedStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Read' BeginRead' EndRead' Seek' SetLength' Write
Rebellious Hierarchy,Switchboard.Server.Utils,MaxReadStream,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\MaxReadStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek
Rebellious Hierarchy,Switchboard.Server.Utils,RedirectingStream,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\RedirectingStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateObjRef' CreateWaitHandle' InitializeLifetimeService
Rebellious Hierarchy,Switchboard.Server.Utils,StartAvailableStream,C:\repos\niik_switchboard\Switchboard.Server\Utils\StartAvailableStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Flush' Seek' SetLength' Write
