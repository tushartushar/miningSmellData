Multifaceted Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexBuffer,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.98
Imperative Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexCapture,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexCapture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Imperative Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexCharacter,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexCharacter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Imperative Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexExpression,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad,PreferencesForm,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Forms\PreferencesForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegExLibrary,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Forms\RegExLibrary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,RegularExpressionScratchpad.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' WindowHeight' WindowWidth' EnterKey' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexCapture,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexCapture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RegexCapture' RegexExpression
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexCapture,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexCapture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RegexCapture' RegexExpression' RegexConditional
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RegularExpressionScratchpad,RegexConditional,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Classes\RegexConditional.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RegexConditional' RegexCapture' RegexExpression' RegexCapture' RegexExpression
Broken Modularization,RegularExpressionScratchpad.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\mikefourie_RegularExpressionScratchpad\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
