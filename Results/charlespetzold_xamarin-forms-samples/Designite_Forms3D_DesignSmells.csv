Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Forms3D,Cube,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Cube.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Faces' faces
Unnecessary Abstraction,Forms3D,Icosahedron,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Icosahedron.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Faces' G' faces
Unutilized Abstraction,Forms3D,Matrix4D,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Matrix4D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Forms3D,Tetrahedron,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Tetrahedron.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Faces' faces
Broken Modularization,Forms3D,Dodecahedron,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Dodecahedron.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Faces' G' H' A' B' faces
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Forms3D,Point3D,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Point3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Forms3D.Point3D' Forms3D.Point4D
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Forms3D,Vector3D,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Vector3D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Forms3D.Vector3D' Forms3D.Point3D
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Forms3D,Point4D,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\charlespetzold_xamarin-forms-samples\KwazyThreeDee\Forms3D\Point4D.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Forms3D.Point4D' Forms3D.Point3D' Forms3D.Vector3D
