Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,PLog,LogTabPage,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\LogTabPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.98
Unnecessary Abstraction,PLog.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' parse_stack_py' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,PLog,MyAsyncInfo,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\AdbConnector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_buffer' m_stream' m_sessionId
Deficient Encapsulation,PLog,CConfig,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\CConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_NDK' m_Python' m_soLib' LOG_FILE' PARSE_STACK_PY_FILE' CONFIG_FILE' m_sExceptionTags' m_sExceptionPids
Deficient Encapsulation,PLog,CConfig,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\CConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: m_NDK' m_Python' m_soLib' LOG_FILE' PARSE_STACK_PY_FILE' CONFIG_FILE' m_sExceptionTags' m_sExceptionPids
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PLog,FormAddFilter,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\FormAddFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FormAddFilter' FormMain
Insufficient Modularization,PLog,LogTabPage,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\PLog\LogTabPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
