Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Win2Tiz,CompileThread,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\CompileThread.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: start
Unnecessary Abstraction,Win2Tiz,IgnoreItem,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\IgnoreItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_type' m_name
Unnecessary Abstraction,Win2Tiz,Specific,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\Specific.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_RemoveValue' m_AddValue
Unnecessary Abstraction,Win2Tiz,SpecificCFLAGS,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\SpecificCFLAGS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_File
Multifaceted Abstraction,Win2Tiz,Win2Tiz,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\Win2Tiz.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Deficient Encapsulation,Win2Tiz,IgnoreItem,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\IgnoreItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_type' m_name
Deficient Encapsulation,Win2Tiz,Specific,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\Specific.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_RemoveValue' m_AddValue
Deficient Encapsulation,Win2Tiz,SpecificCFLAGS,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\SpecificCFLAGS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_File
Insufficient Modularization,Win2Tiz,Win2Tiz,C:\repos\katatunix_projects\Tools\Win2Tiz\Win2Tiz.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 160
