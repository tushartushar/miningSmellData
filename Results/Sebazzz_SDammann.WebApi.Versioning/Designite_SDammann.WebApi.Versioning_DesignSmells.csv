Unnecessary Abstraction,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.Discovery,DefaultControllerNameDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\Discovery\DefaultControllerNameDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ControllerSuffix' DefaultSuffix
Unnecessary Abstraction,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.Discovery,DefaultControllerVersionDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\Discovery\DefaultControllerVersionDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VersionPrefix' DefaultVersionPrefix
Unutilized Abstraction,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.Documentation,VersionedApiExplorer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\Documentation\VersionedApiExplorer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.Internal,ServicesExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\Internal\ServicesExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.Request,DefaultRequestControllerNameDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\Request\DefaultRequestControllerNameDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RouteKey' DefaultRouteKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.Request,DefaultRouteKeyVersionDetector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\Request\DefaultRouteKeyVersionDetector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RouteKey' DefaultRouteKey
Unexploited Encapsulation,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning,ApiVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\ApiVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: UndefinedApiVersion' UndefinedApiVersion (in method "CompareTo" of class "ApiVersion").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning,ApiVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\ApiVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.ApiVersion' SDammann.WebApi.Versioning.UndefinedApiVersion
Cyclic Hierarchy,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning,ApiVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\ApiVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: UndefinedApiVersion
Rebellious Hierarchy,SDammann.WebApi.Versioning,ApiVersion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Sebazzz_SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\src\SDammann.WebApi.Versioning\ApiVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString' GetHashCode
