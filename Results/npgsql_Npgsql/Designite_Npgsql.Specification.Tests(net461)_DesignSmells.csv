Unutilized Abstraction,Npgsql.Specification.Tests,NpgsqlCommandTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\npgsql_Npgsql\test\Npgsql.Specification.Tests\NpgsqlCommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Npgsql.Specification.Tests,NpgsqlConnectionTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\npgsql_Npgsql\test\Npgsql.Specification.Tests\NpgsqlConnectionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Npgsql.Specification.Tests,NpgsqlDataReaderTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\npgsql_Npgsql\test\Npgsql.Specification.Tests\NpgsqlDataReaderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Npgsql.Specification.Tests,NpgsqlDbFactoryFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\npgsql_Npgsql\test\Npgsql.Specification.Tests\NpgsqlDbFactoryFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Factory' ConnectionString' DefaultConnectionString
Rebellious Hierarchy,Npgsql.Specification.Tests,NpgsqlCommandTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\npgsql_Npgsql\test\Npgsql.Specification.Tests\NpgsqlCommandTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteReader_throws_when_transaction_required' ExecuteReader_throws_when_transaction_mismatched
