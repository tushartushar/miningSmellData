Duplicate Abstraction,ActionMailerNext.Implementations.SMTP,SmtpMailSender,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Implementations\SMTP\SmtpMailSender.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SmtpMailSender (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Implementations\SMTP\SmtpMailSender.cs' [99' 118])' SmtpMailSender (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Implementations\SMTP\SmtpMailSender.cs' [143' 162])
Unnecessary Abstraction,ActionMailerNext.Interfaces,IMailResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Interfaces\IMailResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Email' DeliveryStatus
Unnecessary Abstraction,ActionMailerNext.Interfaces,IEmailResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Interfaces\IEmailResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MailAttributes' MessageEncoding
Unutilized Abstraction,ActionMailerNext.Utils,AlternativeViewCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Utils\AlternativeViewCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ActionMailerNext.Utils,NoViewsFoundException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Utils\NoViewsFoundException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ActionMailerNext.Utils,MimeTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Utils\MimeTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ResolveByExtension
Deficient Encapsulation,ActionMailerNext,MailSendingContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\MailSendingContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Cancel
Insufficient Modularization,ActionMailerNext.Utils,MimeTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\Utils\MimeTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 563
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ActionMailerNext,MailAttributes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\crossvertise_ActionMailerNext\src\ActionMailerNext\MailAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ActionMailerNext.MailAttributes' ActionMailerNext.Interfaces.IPostProcessor
