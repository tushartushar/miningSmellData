Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,XMap,AssignmentBuilder,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\AssignmentBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Build
Unutilized Abstraction,XMap,IndirectActionGenerator,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\IndirectActionGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XMap,XEx,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\XEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,XMap,XmlMapper,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\XmlMapper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Deficient Encapsulation,XMap,Helpers,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NewArrayMethod' SafeToStringMethod
Deficient Encapsulation,XMap,Helpers,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\Helpers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NewArrayMethod' SafeToStringMethod
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XMap,ObjectToXmlFuncGenerator,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\ObjectToXmlFuncGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ObjectToXmlFuncGenerator' XmlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XMap,ObjectToXmlFuncGenerator,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\ObjectToXmlFuncGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ObjectToXmlFuncGenerator' XmlMapper' XmlToObjectActionGenerator' XmlMapper
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XMap,XmlToObjectActionGenerator,C:\repos\markrendle_XMap\XMap\XmlToObjectActionGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: XmlToObjectActionGenerator' XmlMapper
