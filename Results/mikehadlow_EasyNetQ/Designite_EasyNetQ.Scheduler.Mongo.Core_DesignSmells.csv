Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core,ScheduleRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikehadlow_EasyNetQ\Source\EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core\ScheduleRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateAndIndex which is more interested in members of the type: IScheduleRepositoryConfiguration
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core,IScheduleRepositoryConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikehadlow_EasyNetQ\Source\EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core\IScheduleRepositoryConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionString' DatabaseName' CollectionName' DeleteTimeout' PublishTimeout
Unnecessary Abstraction,EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core,ISchedulerServiceConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikehadlow_EasyNetQ\Source\EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core\ISchedulerServiceConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SubscriptionId' PublishInterval' HandleTimeoutInterval' PublishMaxSchedules
Broken Modularization,EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core,IScheduleRepositoryConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikehadlow_EasyNetQ\Source\EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core\IScheduleRepositoryConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConnectionString' DatabaseName' CollectionName' DeleteTimeout' PublishTimeout
Broken Modularization,EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core,Schedule,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mikehadlow_EasyNetQ\Source\EasyNetQ.Scheduler.Mongo.Core\Schedule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' WakeTime' BindingKey' CancellationKey' Exchange' ExchangeType' RoutingKey' InnerMessage' BasicProperties' State' PublishingTime' PublishedTime
