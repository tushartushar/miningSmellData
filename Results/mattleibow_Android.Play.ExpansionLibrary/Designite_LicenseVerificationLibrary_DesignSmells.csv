Imperative Abstraction,LicenseVerificationLibrary,ResultListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mattleibow_Android.Play.ExpansionLibrary\LicenseVerificationLibrary\LicenseChecker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: VerifyLicense
Unnecessary Abstraction,LicenseVerificationLibrary,Manifest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mattleibow_Android.Play.ExpansionLibrary\LicenseVerificationLibrary\LicenseChecker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
