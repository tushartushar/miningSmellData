Deficient Encapsulation,System.Windows.Forms,RECT,C:\repos\troymac1ure_Entity\CustomTabControl\TabControl\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: left' top' right' bottom
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Forms,CustomTabControl,C:\repos\troymac1ure_Entity\CustomTabControl\TabControl\CustomTabControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 52 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Windows.Forms,CustomTabControl,C:\repos\troymac1ure_Entity\CustomTabControl\TabControl\CustomTabControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 149
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Windows.Forms,CustomTabControl,C:\repos\troymac1ure_Entity\CustomTabControl\TabControl\CustomTabControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Windows.Forms.CustomTabControl' System.Windows.Forms.TabStyleProvider
Broken Modularization,System.Windows.Forms,PAINTSTRUCT,C:\repos\troymac1ure_Entity\CustomTabControl\TabControl\NativeMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' hdc' fErase' rcPaint' fRestore' fIncUpdate' rgbReserved
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Windows.Forms,TabStyleProvider,C:\repos\troymac1ure_Entity\CustomTabControl\TabControl\TabStyleProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Windows.Forms.TabStyleProvider' System.Windows.Forms.CustomTabControl
