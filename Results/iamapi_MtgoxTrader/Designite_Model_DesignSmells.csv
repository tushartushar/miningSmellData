Broken Modularization,MtGoxTrader.Model,DepthInfoItem,F:\newReposMay17\iamapi_MtgoxTrader\MtgoxTrader\Model\DepthInfoItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Price' Amount' ItemNO' BtcCount' FundCount
Missing Hierarchy,MtGoxTrader.Model,MtGoxTrade,F:\newReposMay17\iamapi_MtgoxTrader\MtgoxTrader\Model\MtGoxTrade.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MtGoxCurrencySymbol' MtGoxTradeType (in method "getObjects" of class "MtGoxTrade").
Rebellious Hierarchy,MtGoxTrader.Model,DynamicJsonConverter,F:\newReposMay17\iamapi_MtgoxTrader\MtgoxTrader\Model\Utilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Serialize
