Unutilized Abstraction,Innovatian.Configuration,EventHandlerExtension,C:\repos\idavis_innovatian.configuration\source\Innovatian.Configuration\EventHandlerExtension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Innovatian.Configuration,SettingsManager,C:\repos\idavis_innovatian.configuration\source\Innovatian.Configuration\SettingsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialize
