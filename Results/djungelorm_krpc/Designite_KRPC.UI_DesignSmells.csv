Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,KRPC.UI,UI,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\UI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KRPC.UI.ExtensionMethods,TextExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\ExtensionMethods\TextExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,KRPC.UI,Addon,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\Addon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: KRPC.UI.Addon' KRPC.UI.Object
Broken Hierarchy,KRPC.UI,Button,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\Button.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KRPC.UI.Object
Broken Hierarchy,KRPC.UI,Canvas,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\Canvas.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KRPC.UI.Object
Broken Hierarchy,KRPC.UI,InputField,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\InputField.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KRPC.UI.Object
Broken Hierarchy,KRPC.UI,Panel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\Panel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KRPC.UI.Object
Broken Hierarchy,KRPC.UI,Text,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\service\UI\src\Text.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KRPC.UI.Object
