Unutilized Abstraction,KRPC.Client.Test,EncoderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\EncoderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,KRPC.Client.Test,TestingTools,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\TestingTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Insufficient Modularization,KRPC.Client.Test,ConnectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\ConnectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,KRPC.Client.Test,ConnectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\ConnectionTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,KRPC.Client.Test,EncoderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\EncoderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,KRPC.Client.Test,StreamTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\StreamTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,KRPC.Client.Test,ConnectionTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\djungelorm_krpc\client\csharp\test\ConnectionTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KRPC.Client.Test.ServerTestCase
