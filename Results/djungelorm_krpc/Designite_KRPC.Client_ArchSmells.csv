Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.94  All the dependencies among components: from: KRPC.Client' to: KRPC.Client.Attributes' from: KRPC' to: KRPC.UI' from: KRPC' to: KRPC.Service' from: KRPC' to: KRPC.Utils' from:
