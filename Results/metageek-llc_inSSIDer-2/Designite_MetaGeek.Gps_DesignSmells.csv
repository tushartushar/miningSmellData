Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GpsController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs' [1' 24])' GpsData (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsData.cs' [1' 24])' NmeaParser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\NmeaParser.cs' [1' 24])
Duplicate Abstraction,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GpsController (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs' [1' 25])' NmeaParser (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\NmeaParser.cs' [1' 25])
Feature Envy,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateGps which is more interested in members of the type: NmeaParser
Unnecessary Abstraction,MetaGeek.Gps,Satellite,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\NmeaParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Azimuth' Elevation' Id' IsUsed' Snr
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsControllerN.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PortBaudrate' PortDataBits' PortHandshake' PortParity' PortStopBits
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Altitude' Course' DgpsAge' Dgpsid' FixType' GeoidSeperation' Hdop' Latitude' Longitude' MagVar' Pdop' SatellitesUsed' SatelliteTime' Speed' Vdop
Deficient Encapsulation,MetaGeek.Gps,Satellite,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\NmeaParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Azimuth' Elevation' Id' IsUsed' Snr
Broken Modularization,MetaGeek.Gps,GpsData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\GpsData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Altitude' Course' DgpsAge' Dgpsid' Empty' FixType' GeoidSeperation' Hdop' Latitude' Longitude' MagVar' Pdop' SatellitesUsed' SatelliteTime' Speed' Vdop
Broken Modularization,MetaGeek.Gps,Satellite,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\metageek-llc_inSSIDer-2\MetaGeek.Gps\NmeaParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
