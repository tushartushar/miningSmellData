Feature Envy,XPlatUtils.Tests,MessengerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonathanpeppers_XPlatUtils\XPlatUtils.Tests\MessengerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SubscribeAndPublish which is more interested in members of the type: Messenger
