Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Log4Net.Async,AsyncForwardingAppender,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\AsyncForwardingAppender.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ActivateOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,Log4Net.Async,IQueue,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\IQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Log4Net.Async,ReferencedLibraryAttribute,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\ReferencedLibraryAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Log4Net.Async,ReferencedLibraryAttribute,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\ReferencedLibraryAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Log4Net.Async,ReferencedLibraryAttribute,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\ReferencedLibraryAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Log4Net.Async.ReferencedLibraryAttribute' MyNamespace.ReferencedLibraryAttribute
Unutilized Abstraction,Log4Net.Async,RingBuffer<T>,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\RingBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,MyNamespace,ReferencedLibraryAttribute,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\ReferencedLibraryAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,MyNamespace,ReferencedLibraryAttribute,C:\repos\cjbhaines_Log4Net.Async\src\Log4Net.Async\ReferencedLibraryAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
