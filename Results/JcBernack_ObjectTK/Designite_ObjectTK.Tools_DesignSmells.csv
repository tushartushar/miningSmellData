Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ObjectTK.Tools.Cameras,Camera,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Cameras\Camera.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ObjectTK.Tools.Cameras,Camera,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Cameras\Camera.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetCameraTransform which is more interested in members of the type: CameraState
Deficient Encapsulation,ObjectTK.Tools.Cameras,Camera,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Cameras\Camera.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: State' DefaultState' MouseMoveSpeed' MouseWheelSpeed' MoveSpeed
Deficient Encapsulation,ObjectTK.Tools.Cameras,CameraState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Cameras\CameraState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' LookAt' Up
Deficient Encapsulation,ObjectTK.Tools.Cameras,FreeLookAlignedBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Cameras\FreeLookAlignedBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AlignmentPoint
Deficient Encapsulation,ObjectTK.Tools.Cameras,ThirdPersonBehavior,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Cameras\ThirdPersonBehavior.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Origin
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,Circle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\Circle.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.Shape
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,ColorCube,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\ColorCube.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.ColoredShape
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,Cube,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\Cube.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.IndexedShape
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,LayeredQuads,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\LayeredQuads.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.IndexedShape
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,Quad,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\Quad.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.Shape
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,Rect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\Rect.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.Shape
Broken Hierarchy,ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes,TexturedQuad,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JcBernack_ObjectTK\ObjectTK.Tools\Shapes\TexturedQuad.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ObjectTK.Tools.Shapes.TexturedShape
