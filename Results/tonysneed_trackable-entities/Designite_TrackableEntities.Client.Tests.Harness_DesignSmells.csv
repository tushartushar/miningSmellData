Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,TrackingProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TrackingState' ModifiedProperties
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,ChangeTrackingMembers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ChangeTrackingPropEnd
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,CollectionSerializationHelper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Deficient Encapsulation,TrackableEntities.Client,CollectionSerializationHelper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TrackableEntities.Client,PortableReflectionHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\PortableReflectionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TrackableEntities.Client.PortableReflectionHelper' TrackableEntities.Client.PortableReflectionHelperImpl
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TrackableEntities.Client,TrackableExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TrackableEntities.Client.TrackableExtensions' TrackableEntities.Client.ChangeTrackingCollection<TEntity>
Cyclic Hierarchy,TrackableEntities.Client,PortableReflectionHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\PortableReflectionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: PortableReflectionHelperImpl
