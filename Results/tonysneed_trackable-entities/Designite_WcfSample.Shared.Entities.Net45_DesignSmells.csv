Duplicate Abstraction,WcfSample.Shared.Entities.Net45.Models,Customer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WcfSample\WcfSample.Shared.Entities.Net45\Models\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Customer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WcfSample\WcfSample.Shared.Entities.Net45\Models\Customer.cs' [54' 80])' Employee (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WcfSample\WcfSample.Shared.Entities.Net45\Models\Employee.cs' [79' 105])
