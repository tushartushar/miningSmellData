Imperative Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,CloneChangesHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetChanges
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,EntityChangedInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RefNavPropUnchanged' ColNavPropChangedEntities
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,Wrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Result' TrackingState' ModifiedProperties
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,TrackingProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TrackingState' ModifiedProperties
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,ChangeTrackingMembers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ChangeTrackingPropEnd
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,EquatableMembers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' EquatableMethodStart' EquatableMethodEnd' EntityIdentifierProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,ChangeTrackingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,CollectionSerializationHelper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Result
Deficient Encapsulation,TrackableEntities.Client,CollectionSerializationHelper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TrackableEntities.Client,ChangeTrackingCollection<TEntity>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TrackableEntities.Client.ChangeTrackingCollection<TEntity>' TrackableEntities.Client.TrackableExtensions
Wide Hierarchy,TrackableEntities.Client,EntityBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\EntityBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.FamilyModels.Child' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.FamilyModels.Family' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.FamilyModels.Parent' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Area' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.CustomerSetting' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Territory' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Employee' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Category' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Customer' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Order' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.OrderDetail' TrackableEntities.Client.Tests.Entities.NorthwindModels.Product' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Area' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Category' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Customer' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.CustomerSetting' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Employee' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Order' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.OrderDetail' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Product' TrackableEntities.Tests.Acceptance.ClientEntities.Territory
