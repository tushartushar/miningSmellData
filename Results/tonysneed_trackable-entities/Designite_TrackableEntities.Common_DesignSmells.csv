Unutilized Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Common,ObjectReferenceEqualityComparer<T>,C:\repos\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Common\ObjectReferenceEqualityComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Common,TrackableExtensions,C:\repos\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Common\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities,IMergeable,C:\repos\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Common\IMergeable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EntityIdentifier

Cyclic Hierarchy,TrackableEntities.Common,EntityNavigationProperty,C:\repos\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Common\EntityNavigationProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: EntityReferenceProperty
