Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RefNavPropUnchanged' ColNavPropChangedEntities
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,Wrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Result' TrackingState' ModifiedProperties
Unutilized Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,ChangeTrackingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ChangeTrackingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,TrackingProperties,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' TrackingState' ModifiedProperties
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,ChangeTrackingMembers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ChangeTrackingPropEnd
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,EquatableMembers,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\ModelBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' EquatableMethodStart' EquatableMethodEnd' EntityIdentifierProperty
Unnecessary Abstraction,TrackableEntities.Client,CollectionSerializationHelper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Result
Deficient Encapsulation,TrackableEntities.Client,CollectionSerializationHelper<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Source\TrackableEntities.Client\TrackableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result
