Cyclically-dependent Modularization,WebApiSample.Mvvm.Client.Entities.Models,Customer,C:\repos\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.Mvvm\WebApiSample.Mvvm\WebApiSample.Mvvm.Client.Entities\Models\Customer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WebApiSample.Mvvm.Client.Entities.Models.Customer' WebApiSample.Mvvm.Client.Entities.Models.CustomerSetting
Broken Modularization,WebApiSample.Mvvm.Client.Entities.Models,CustomerSetting,C:\repos\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.Mvvm\WebApiSample.Mvvm\WebApiSample.Mvvm.Client.Entities\Models\CustomerSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CustomerId' Setting' Customer' CustomerChangeTracker' _CustomerId' _Setting' _Customer
