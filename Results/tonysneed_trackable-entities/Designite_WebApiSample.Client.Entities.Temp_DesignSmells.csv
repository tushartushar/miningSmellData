Duplicate Abstraction,WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp,Employee,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\Employee.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Employee (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\Employee.cs' [82' 105])' Location (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\Location.cs' [18' 41])
Unnecessary Abstraction,WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp,Location,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\Location.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: City' Country' _City' _Country
Unutilized Abstraction,WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp,NorthwindSlimEntities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\NorthwindSlim.Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp,CustomerSetting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\CustomerSetting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CustomerId' Setting' Customer' CustomerChangeTracker' _CustomerId' _Setting' _Customer
Broken Modularization,WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp,OrderDetail,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\OrderDetail.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: OrderDetailId' OrderId' ProductId' UnitPrice' Quantity' Discount' Order' OrderChangeTracker' Product' ProductChangeTracker' _OrderDetailId' _OrderId' _ProductId' _UnitPrice' _Quantity' _Discount' _Order' _Product
Rebellious Hierarchy,WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp,NorthwindSlimEntities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tonysneed_trackable-entities\Samples\VS2013\WebApiSample.ModelFirst\WebApiSample.Client.Entities.Temp\NorthwindSlim.Context.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnModelCreating
