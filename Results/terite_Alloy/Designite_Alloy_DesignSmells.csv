List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: KeyboardEventType[1' 23]' PositionedScreen[1' 23]' Screen[1' 23]' Position[1' 23]' ConnectMessage[1' 23]' ScreenChangedMessage[1' 23]
Duplicate Abstraction,Alloy,KeyboardEventType,C:\repos\terite_Alloy\Alloy\KeyboardEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: KeyboardEventType[1' 21]' ConnectMessage[1' 21]' ScreenChangedMessage[1' 21]' Position[1' 21]' PositionedScreen[1' 21]' Screen[1' 21]
Unutilized Abstraction,Alloy,PositionedScreenSerializer,C:\repos\terite_Alloy\Alloy\PositionedScreen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Alloy.Messages,MachineStateMessage,C:\repos\terite_Alloy\Alloy\Messages\MachineStateMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: MachineStateMessage[1' 22]' AlloyMessageType[1' 22]' ConnectResult[1' 22]' KeyboardEventMessage[1' 22]' MouseEventMessage[1' 22]
Deficient Encapsulation,Alloy,Position,C:\repos\terite_Alloy\Alloy\MouseEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: X' Y
Broken Hierarchy,Alloy,PositionedScreen,C:\repos\terite_Alloy\Alloy\PositionedScreen.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Screen
