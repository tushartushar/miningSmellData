Unnecessary Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.Tests,BaseTestFixtureController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.Tests\BaseViewOnlyTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.Tests,ComponentsTestCase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.Tests\ComponentsTestCase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
