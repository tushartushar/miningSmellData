Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity,CustomDirectiveManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\CustomDirectiveManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity,ResourceLoaderAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\ResourceLoaderAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetViewSource which is more interested in members of the type: IViewSourceLoader
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity,CustomResourceManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\CustomResourceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomResourceManager' Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.NVelocityViewEngine
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity,CustomTemplate,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\CustomTemplate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomTemplate' Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.ResourceLoaderAdapter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity,NVelocityViewContextAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\NVelocityViewContextAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.NVelocityViewContextAdapter' Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomDirectives.IViewRenderer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomDirectives,SubSectionDirective,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\CustomDirectives\SubSectionDirective.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomDirectives.SubSectionDirective' Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.NVelocityViewContextAdapter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomDirectives,IViewRenderer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\CustomDirectives\IViewRenderer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomDirectives.IViewRenderer' Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.NVelocityViewContextAdapter' Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.CustomDirectives.SubSectionDirective
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity,ResourceLoaderAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\ResourceLoaderAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Init
Unfactored Hierarchy,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.JSGeneration,JSElementGeneratorDuck,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\JSGeneration\JSElementGeneratorDuck.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  JSElementGeneratorDuck (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\JSGeneration\JSElementGeneratorDuck.cs' [1' 23])' JSGeneratorDuck (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\JSGeneration\JSGeneratorDuck.cs' [1' 23])
Unfactored Hierarchy,Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.JSGeneration,JSElementGeneratorDuck,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\JSGeneration\JSElementGeneratorDuck.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  JSElementGeneratorDuck (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\JSGeneration\JSElementGeneratorDuck.cs' [45' 68])' JSGeneratorDuck (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_MonoRail\MR2\src\Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity\JSGeneration\JSGeneratorDuck.cs' [50' 73])
