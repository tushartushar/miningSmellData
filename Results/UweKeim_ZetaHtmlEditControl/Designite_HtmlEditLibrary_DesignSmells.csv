Unnecessary Abstraction,ZetaHtmlEditControl.Code.Html,ImageInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaHtmlEditControl\Source\Control\Code\Html\HtmlConversionHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Source' Width' Height
Unutilized Abstraction,ZetaHtmlEditLibrary,TextAndImageHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaHtmlEditControl\Source\HtmlEditLibrary\TextAndImageHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ZetaHtmlEditControl.Code.Helper,PathHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaHtmlEditControl\Source\HtmlEditLibrary\Helper\PathHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ZetaHtmlEditControl.Code.Helper,PathHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaHtmlEditControl\Source\HtmlEditLibrary\Helper\PathHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 40 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ZetaHtmlEditControl.Code.Helper,PathHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\UweKeim_ZetaHtmlEditControl\Source\HtmlEditLibrary\Helper\PathHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
