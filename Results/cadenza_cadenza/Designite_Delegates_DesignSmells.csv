Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Cadenza.Tools,Delegates,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Delegates (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs' [328' 381])' Delegates (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs' [625' 678])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cadenza.Tools,Delegates,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cadenza.Tools.Delegates' Cadenza.Tools.ActionCoda
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cadenza.Tools,FuncCoda,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cadenza.Tools.FuncCoda' Cadenza.Tools.Delegates
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cadenza.Tools,ActionCoda,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cadenza.Tools.ActionCoda' Cadenza.Tools.Delegates' Cadenza.Tools.FuncCoda
Cyclic Hierarchy,Cadenza.Tools,Delegates,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cadenza_cadenza\tools\Delegates.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ActionCoda
