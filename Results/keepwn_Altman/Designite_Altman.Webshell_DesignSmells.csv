Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Altman.Webshell.Core,CustomCommandCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomCommandCode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetCode
Feature Envy,Altman.Webshell.Core,CustomShellType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AddFuncTreeNode which is more interested in members of the type: FuncTreeNode
Imperative Abstraction,Altman.Webshell,InitWorker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\InitWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: RegisterCustomShellType
Unutilized Abstraction,Altman.Webshell,InitWorker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\InitWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Altman.Webshell,Service,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Service.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Altman.Webshell.Core,ParamStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Location' EncryMode
Deficient Encapsulation,Altman.Webshell.Core,Basic,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ShellTypeName' ServiceExample' MainCodeParam
Deficient Encapsulation,Altman.Webshell.Core,MainCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Item' FuncCodeParam
Deficient Encapsulation,Altman.Webshell.Core,FuncCode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Type' Path' Item' FuncParams
Deficient Encapsulation,Altman.Webshell.Core,TreeInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Path' Type' Info
Broken Modularization,Altman.Webshell.Model,Shell,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Model\Shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' TargetId' TargetLevel' Status' ShellUrl' ShellPwd' ShellType' ShellExtraString' ServerCoding' WebCoding' TimeOut' Area' Remark' AddTime
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Altman.Webshell.Core,CustomShellType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\keepwn_Altman\Source\Altman.Webshell\Core\CustomShellType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Altman.Webshell.Core.CustomShellType' Altman.Webshell.Core.FuncTreeNode
