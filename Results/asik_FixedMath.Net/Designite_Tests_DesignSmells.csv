Unutilized Abstraction,FixMath.NET,Fix16Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Experimental\Fix16Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FixMath.NET,Fix64Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Fix64Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FixMath.NET,Fix8Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Experimental\Fix8Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix16,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Experimental\Fix16.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix16Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Experimental\Fix16Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix16Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Experimental\Fix16Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix64Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Fix64Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix64Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Fix64Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix64Tests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\tests\Fix64Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
