Unutilized Abstraction,FixMath.NET,Fix64,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\src\Fix64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,FixMath.NET,Fix64,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\src\Fix64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Fix64 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\src\Fix64.cs' [188' 207])' Fix64 (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\src\Fix64.cs' [270' 289])
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix64,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\src\Fix64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FixMath.NET,Fix64,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\asik_FixedMath.Net\src\Fix64.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
