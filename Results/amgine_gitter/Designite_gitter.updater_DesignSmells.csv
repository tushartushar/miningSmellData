Unnecessary Abstraction,gitter,Verify,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Verify.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,gitter,State,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Verify.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Feature Envy,gitter.Updater,DeployProcess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.updater.prj\DeployDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateProc which is more interested in members of the type: UpdateProcessMonitor
Feature Envy,gitter.Updater,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.updater.prj\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MainForm which is more interested in members of the type: UpdateProcessMonitor
Insufficient Modularization,gitter,Assert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Debug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,gitter,Argument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Verify.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,gitter,Argument,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Verify.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Unfactored Hierarchy,gitter.Updater,DeployDriver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.updater.prj\DeployDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  DeployDriver (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.updater.prj\DeployDriver.cs' [58' 87])' GitUpdateDriver (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.updater.prj\GitUpdateDriver.cs' [359' 388])
