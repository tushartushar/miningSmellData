Duplicate Abstraction,gitter,Assert,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Debug.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Assert (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Debug.cs' [1' 20])' Verify (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Verify.cs' [1' 20])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.uac.prj\Program.cs' [1' 20])' RemoteExecutor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\gitter.uac.prj\RemoteExecutor.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,gitter,Verify,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\amgine_gitter\shared\Verify.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
