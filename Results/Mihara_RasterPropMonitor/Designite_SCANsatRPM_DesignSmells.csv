Unutilized Abstraction,SCANsatRPM,JSISCANsatRPM,C:\repos\Mihara_RasterPropMonitor\SCANsatRPM\JSISCANsatRPM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsatRPM,JSISCANsatRPM,C:\repos\Mihara_RasterPropMonitor\SCANsatRPM\JSISCANsatRPM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: buttonUp' buttonDown' buttonEnter' buttonEsc' buttonHome' maxZoom' iconPixelSize' iconShadowShift' redrawEdge' iconColorSelf' iconColorTarget' iconColorUnvisitedAnomaly' iconColorVisitedAnomaly' iconColorShadow' iconColorAP' iconColorPE' iconColorNode' iconColorANDN' trailColor' zoomModifier' scaleBar' scaleLabels' scaleLevels' scaleBarPosition' scaleBarSizeLimit' trailLimit' trailPointEvery' orbitPoints
Deficient Encapsulation,SCANsatRPM,MapMarkupLine,C:\repos\Mihara_RasterPropMonitor\SCANsatRPM\JSISCANsatRPM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: body' color' points
Insufficient Modularization,SCANsatRPM,JSISCANsatRPM,C:\repos\Mihara_RasterPropMonitor\SCANsatRPM\JSISCANsatRPM.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 105
