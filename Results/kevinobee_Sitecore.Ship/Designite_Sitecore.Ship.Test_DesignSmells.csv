Feature Envy,Sitecore.Ship.Test,PublishModuleBehaviour,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kevinobee_Sitecore.Ship\tests\unit-test\Sitecore.Ship.Test\PublishModuleTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Should_pass_publish_targets_to_service_if_specified which is more interested in members of the type: PublishParameters
