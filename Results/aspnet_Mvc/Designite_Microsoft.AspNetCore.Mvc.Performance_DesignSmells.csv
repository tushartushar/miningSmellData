Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,ActionSelectorBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\ActionSelectorBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,MvcEndpointDataSourceBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\MvcEndpointDatasourceBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,Person,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\ValidationVisitorModelWithValidatedProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Description' Address
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,Address,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\ValidationVisitorModelWithValidatedProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Street' Street2' Type' Zip
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,MvcEndpointDataSourceBenchmark,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\MvcEndpointDatasourceBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ActionCount
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,RuntimePerformanceBenchmarkBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\RuntimePerformanceBenchmarkBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ViewPath
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance,MockParameterPolicyFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aspnet_Mvc\benchmarks\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Performance\MvcEndpointDatasourceBenchmark.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create' Create
