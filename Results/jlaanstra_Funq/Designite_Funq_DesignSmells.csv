Duplicate Abstraction,Funq,Container,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Container.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Container[1' 35]' IFluentInterface[1' 35]' ResolutionException[1' 35]' ServiceKey[1' 35]' IRegistration[1' 35]
Duplicate Abstraction,Funq,Container,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Container.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Container[1' 34]' IFunqlet[1' 34]' Owner[1' 34]' ReuseScope[1' 34]' ServiceEntry[1' 34]' IFluentInterface[1' 34]' ResolutionException[1' 34]' ServiceKey[1' 34]' IRegistration[1' 34]
Duplicate Abstraction,Funq,IFluentInterface,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\IFluentInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IFluentInterface[1' 39]' IRegistration[1' 39]
Unutilized Abstraction,Funq,IFunqlet,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\IFunqlet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Funq,Owner,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Owner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Owner[1' 36]' ReuseScope[1' 36]' ServiceEntry[1' 36]
Unnecessary Abstraction,Funq,IRegistration,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Syntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Funq,IInitializable,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Syntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Funq,IReusedOwned,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Syntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,Funq,ServiceEntry,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\ServiceEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Owner' Reuse' Container
Deficient Encapsulation,Funq,ServiceKey,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\ServiceKey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FactoryType' Name
Insufficient Modularization,Funq,Container,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Container.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Funq,Container,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Container.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Container' ServiceEntry
Multipath Hierarchy,Funq,IRegistration,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Syntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IFluentInterface
Multipath Hierarchy,Funq,IReusedOwned,C:\repos\jlaanstra_Funq\Funq\Syntax.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IFluentInterface
