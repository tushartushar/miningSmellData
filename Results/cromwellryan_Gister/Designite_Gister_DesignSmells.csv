Unnecessary Abstraction,EchelonTouchInc.Gister.Api.Credentials,AnonymousGitHubCredentials,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\Api\Credentials\GitHubCredentials.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,EchelonTouchInc.Gister,GisterPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\GisterPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EchelonTouchInc.Gister,GuidList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidGisterPkgString' guidGisterCmdSetString' guidGisterWithDescriptionStringCmdSet' guidGisterCmdSet' guidGisterWithDescriptionCmdSet
Unnecessary Abstraction,EchelonTouchInc.Gister,PkgCmdIDList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\PkgCmdID.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' cmdCreateGist' cmdCreateGistWithDescription
Broken Modularization,EchelonTouchInc.Gister,GuidList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidGisterPkgString' guidGisterCmdSetString' guidGisterWithDescriptionStringCmdSet' guidGisterCmdSet' guidGisterWithDescriptionCmdSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EchelonTouchInc.Gister.Api.Credentials,GitHubCredentials,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\Api\Credentials\GitHubCredentials.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EchelonTouchInc.Gister.Api.Credentials.GitHubCredentials' EchelonTouchInc.Gister.Api.Credentials.AnonymousGitHubCredentials
Rebellious Hierarchy,EchelonTouchInc.Gister.Api.Credentials,AnonymousGitHubCredentialsForFluentHttp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\Api\Credentials\AnonymousGitHubCredentialsForFluentHttp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Apply
Cyclic Hierarchy,EchelonTouchInc.Gister.Api.Credentials,GitHubCredentials,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cromwellryan_Gister\Gister\Api\Credentials\GitHubCredentials.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: AnonymousGitHubCredentials
