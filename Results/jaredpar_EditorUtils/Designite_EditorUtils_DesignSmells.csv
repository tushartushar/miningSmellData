Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,EditorUtils,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AssemblyVersion' DefaultAsyncDelay
Unutilized Abstraction,EditorUtils,EditorHostFactory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\EditorHostFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EditorUtils,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EditorUtils,EditorUtilsResources,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\EditorUtilsResources.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' InvalidLineNumber
Unnecessary Abstraction,EditorUtils,UsedInBackgroundThreadAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\UsedInBackgroundThreadAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Feature Envy,EditorUtils.Implementation.Tagging,AsyncTagger<TData;TTag>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\Implementation\Tagging\AsyncTagger.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RemoveHandlers which is more interested in members of the type: IAsyncTaggerSource
Insufficient Modularization,EditorUtils,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,EditorUtils,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EditorUtils.Implementation.BasicUndo,BasicUndoHistory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\Implementation\BasicUndo\BasicUndoHistory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EditorUtils.Implementation.BasicUndo.BasicUndoHistory' EditorUtils.Implementation.BasicUndo.BasicUndoTransaction
Rebellious Hierarchy,EditorUtils,AsyncTaggerSource<TData;TTag>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jaredpar_EditorUtils\Src\EditorUtils\AsyncTaggerSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetDataForSnapshot' GetTagsInBackground
