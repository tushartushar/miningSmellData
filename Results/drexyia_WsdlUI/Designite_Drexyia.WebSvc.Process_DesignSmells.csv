Duplicate Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcSync.Operations,SyncOp,C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcSync\Operations\SyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SyncOp (C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcSync\Operations\SyncOp.cs' [16' 42])' AsyncOp (C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\Operations\AsyncOp.cs' [35' 61])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync,CancelToken,C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\CancelObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' IsCancellationRequested
Imperative Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync.Operations,AsyncOp,C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\Operations\AsyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Deficient Encapsulation,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync,CancelToken,C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\CancelObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsCancellationRequested
Rebellious Hierarchy,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync.Operations,RetrieveAsyncOp,C:\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\Operations\RetrieveAsyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TearDown
