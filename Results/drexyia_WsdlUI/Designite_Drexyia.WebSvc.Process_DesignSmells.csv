Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcSync.Operations,CallSyncOp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcSync\Operations\CallSyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Work which is more interested in members of the type: WebSvcMethod
Duplicate Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcSync.Operations,SyncOp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcSync\Operations\SyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SyncOp (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcSync\Operations\SyncOp.cs' [16' 42])' AsyncOp (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\Operations\AsyncOp.cs' [35' 61])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync,CancelToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\CancelObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' IsCancellationRequested
Imperative Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync.Operations,CallAsyncOp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\Operations\CallAsyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: _cancelObject_OnCancel
Deficient Encapsulation,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync,CancelToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\CancelObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IsCancellationRequested
Rebellious Hierarchy,Drexyia.WebSvc.Process.WebSvcAsync.Operations,RetrieveAsyncOp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Process\WebSvcAsync\Operations\RetrieveAsyncOp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TearDown
