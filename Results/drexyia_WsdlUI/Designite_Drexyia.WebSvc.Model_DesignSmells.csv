Unnecessary Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Model,WebSvcMessageResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Model\WebSvcMessageResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Status
Unnecessary Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Model,WebSvcMessageRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Model\WebSvcMessageRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' HEADER_NAME_SOAP_ACTION
Unnecessary Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Model,IProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Model\IProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Port' Host' ProxyType
Unutilized Abstraction,Drexyia.WebSvc.Model,WebSvc,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Model\WebSvc.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Drexyia.WebSvc.Model,IProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Model\IProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Drexyia.WebSvc.Model.IProxy' Drexyia.WebSvc.Model.Proxy
Cyclic Hierarchy,Drexyia.WebSvc.Model,IProxy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\drexyia_WsdlUI\Drexyia\Drexyia.WebSvc.Model\IProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Proxy
