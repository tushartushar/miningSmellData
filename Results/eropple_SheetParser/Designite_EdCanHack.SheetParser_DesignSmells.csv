Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,EdCanHack.SheetParser,ISheetReader,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\ISheetReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EdCanHack.SheetParser.Transforms,IKeyed,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\Transforms\IKeyed.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Key
Unutilized Abstraction,EdCanHack.SheetParser.Transforms,SheetTransformer,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\Transforms\SheetTransformer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EdCanHack.SheetParser.Transforms,KeyedSheetTransformer,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\Transforms\SheetTransformer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,EdCanHack.SheetParser.Transforms.Serialization,SheetDeserializer,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\Transforms\Serialization\SheetDeserializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,EdCanHack.SheetParser.SpreadsheetML,SpreadsheetMLReader,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\SpreadsheetML\SpreadsheetMLReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SpreadsheetMLReader' SpreadsheetMLSheet
Broken Hierarchy,EdCanHack.SheetParser.Transforms,KeyedSheetTransformer,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\Transforms\SheetTransformer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SheetTransformer
Rebellious Hierarchy,EdCanHack.SheetParser.Transforms.Serialization,SheetDeserializer,C:\repos\eropple_SheetParser\EdCanHack.SheetParser\Transforms\Serialization\SheetDeserializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FromRow
