Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Tester,FastTreeEditSample,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastTreeEditSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FastTreeEditSample (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastTreeEditSample.cs' [18' 44])' FastTreeSimplestSample (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastTreeSimplestSample.cs' [18' 44])
Feature Envy,Tester,FastListCustomize,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastListCustomize.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: fl_PaintItem which is more interested in members of the type: FastList
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tester,MyItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastListVirtualCheckboxesSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Name' Checked
Duplicate Abstraction,Tester,FastTreeDragAndDropSample,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastTreeDragAndDropSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FastTreeDragAndDropSample (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastTreeDragAndDropSample.cs' [33' 52])' FastTreeSimplestSample (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastTreeSimplestSample.cs' [33' 52])
Feature Envy,Tester,FastListExpandedSample,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastListExpandedSample.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: fl_PaintItemContent which is more interested in members of the type: FastList
Multifaceted Abstraction,Tester,MainForm,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tester.Properties,Settings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Tester,MyItem,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\PavelTorgashov_FastTree\Tester\FastListVirtualCheckboxesSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Checked
