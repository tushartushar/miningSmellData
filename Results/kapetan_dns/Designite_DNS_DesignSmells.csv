Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Class' SIZE' type' klass
Duplicate Abstraction,DNS.Protocol,Tail,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\Question.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: DNS.Protocol.Tail' DNS.Protocol.ResourceRecords.Tail

Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TimeToLive' DataLength' Data
Imperative Abstraction,DNS.Protocol.ResourceRecords,StartOfAuthorityResourceRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\ResourceRecords\StartOfAuthorityResourceRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ToString
Unutilized Abstraction,DNS.Protocol.Utils,ByteExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\Utils\ByteExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DNS.Protocol.Utils,TaskExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\Utils\TaskExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DNS.Server,DnsServer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Server\DnsServer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,DNS.Protocol,IResponse,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\IResponse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' AnswerRecords' AuthorityRecords' AdditionalRecords' RecursionAvailable' AuthenticData' CheckingDisabled' AuthorativeServer' Truncated' OperationCode' ResponseCode
Broken Modularization,DNS.Protocol,Tail,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\Question.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Class' SIZE' type' klass
Broken Modularization,DNS.Protocol.ResourceRecords,Tail,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\ResourceRecords\ResourceRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Type' Class' TimeToLive' DataLength' SIZE' type' klass' ttl' dataLength
Broken Modularization,DNS.Protocol.ResourceRecords,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\ResourceRecords\StartOfAuthorityResourceRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SerialNumber' RefreshInterval' RetryInterval' ExpireInterval' MinimumTimeToLive' SIZE' serialNumber' refreshInterval' retryInterval' expireInterval' ttl
Rebellious Hierarchy,DNS.Client.RequestResolver,NullRequestResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Client\RequestResolver\NullRequestResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Resolve
Rebellious Hierarchy,DNS.Protocol.Utils,ByteStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kapetan_dns\DNS\Protocol\Utils\ByteStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
