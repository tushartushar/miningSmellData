Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,CsvLINQPadDriver,CsvLINQPadDriver.CodeGen,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CsvLINQPadDriver
Unstable Dependency,CsvLINQPadDriver,CsvLINQPadDriver.DataDisplay,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CsvLINQPadDriver.CodeGen
Unstable Dependency,CsvLINQPadDriver,CsvLINQPadDriver.DataModel,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CsvLINQPadDriver
Unstable Dependency,CsvLINQPadDriver,CsvLINQPadDriver.Helpers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CsvLINQPadDriver.CodeGen
Ambiguous Interface,CsvLINQPadDriver,CsvLINQPadDriver.DataModel,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: CsvDataModelGenerator
Feature Concentration,CsvLINQPadDriver,CsvLINQPadDriver.CodeGen,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
