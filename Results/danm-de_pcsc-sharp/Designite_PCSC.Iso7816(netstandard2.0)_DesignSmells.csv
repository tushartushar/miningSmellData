Unutilized Abstraction,PCSC.Iso7816,FileDescriptor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danm-de_pcsc-sharp\src\PCSC.Iso7816\FileDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,PCSC.Iso7816,IsoReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\danm-de_pcsc-sharp\src\PCSC.Iso7816\IsoReader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SimpleTransmit which is more interested in members of the type: ISCardReader
