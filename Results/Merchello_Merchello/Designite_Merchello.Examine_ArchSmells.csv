Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Merchello.Examine,Merchello.Examine.DataServices,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Merchello.Examine.DataServices' Merchello.Examine.Providers,Merchello.Examine.DataServices.CustomerDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.BaseMerchelloIndexer' Merchello.Examine.Providers.CustomerIndexer
Unstable Dependency,Merchello.Examine,Merchello.Examine.Providers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Merchello.Examine.DataServices,Merchello.Examine.Providers.IDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.ILogService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.ICustomerDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.IOrderDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.IInvoiceDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.IProductDataService
Feature Concentration,Merchello.Examine,Merchello.Examine.DataServices,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DataServiceBase' CustomerDataService' ICustomerDataService' InvoiceDataService' OrderDataService' IIndexDataService' IProductDataService' ProductDataService' IInvoiceDataService' IOrderDataService]' [IDataService' MerchelloDataService]' [ILogService' MerchelloLogService]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.21,Merchello.Examine.DataServices.ILogService' Merchello.Examine.DataServices.MerchelloLogService
Feature Concentration,Merchello.Examine,Merchello.Examine.LocalStorage,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DeletePolicyTracker' LocalTempStorageIndexer' LocalStorageType' LocalTempStorageDirectory' LocalTempStorageDirectoryTracker' MultiIndexOutput' InitializeDirectoryFlags]' [MultiIndexLock' MultiIndexLockFactory]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,Merchello.Examine.LocalStorage.MultiIndexLock' Merchello.Examine.LocalStorage.MultiIndexLockFactory
Scattered Functionality,Merchello.Examine,Merchello.Examine.Providers,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: Merchello.Examine' Merchello.Examine.DataServices,Merchello.Examine.IndexSetExtensions' Merchello.Examine.DataServices.IIndexDataService
