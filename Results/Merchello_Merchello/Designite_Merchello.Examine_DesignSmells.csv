Imperative Abstraction,Merchello.Examine.LocalStorage,LocalTempStorageIndexer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\LocalStorage\LocalTempStorageIndexer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Initialize
Unutilized Abstraction,Merchello.Examine,SearchHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\SearchHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Merchello.Examine,IndexSetExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\IndexSetExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Merchello.Examine,IndexTypes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\IndexTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ProductVariant' Order' Invoice' Customer
Unnecessary Abstraction,Merchello.Examine.Models,SearchTerm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\Models\SearchTerm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Term' SearchTermType
Insufficient Modularization,Merchello.Examine.LocalStorage,LocalTempStorageDirectory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\LocalStorage\LocalTempStorageDirectory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Merchello.Examine.DataServices,CustomerDataService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\DataServices\CustomerDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Merchello.Examine.DataServices.CustomerDataService' Merchello.Examine.DataServices.MerchelloDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.BaseMerchelloIndexer' Merchello.Examine.Providers.CustomerIndexer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Merchello.Examine.DataServices,InvoiceDataService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\DataServices\InvoiceDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Merchello.Examine.DataServices.InvoiceDataService' Merchello.Examine.DataServices.MerchelloDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.BaseMerchelloIndexer' Merchello.Examine.Providers.InvoiceIndexer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Merchello.Examine.DataServices,OrderDataService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\DataServices\OrderDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Merchello.Examine.DataServices.OrderDataService' Merchello.Examine.DataServices.MerchelloDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.BaseMerchelloIndexer' Merchello.Examine.Providers.OrderIndexer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Merchello.Examine.DataServices,ProductDataService,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Merchello_Merchello\src\Merchello.Examine\DataServices\ProductDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Merchello.Examine.DataServices.ProductDataService' Merchello.Examine.DataServices.MerchelloDataService' Merchello.Examine.Providers.BaseMerchelloIndexer' Merchello.Examine.Providers.ProductIndexer
