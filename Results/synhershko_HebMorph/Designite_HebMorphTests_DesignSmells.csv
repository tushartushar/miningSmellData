Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,HebMorph.Tests,ErrorCorrectionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\ErrorCorrectionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: AssertWord which is more interested in members of the type: Lemmatizer
Unnecessary Abstraction,HebMorph.Tests,TestBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\TestBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HspellDict' dict
Unutilized Abstraction,HebMorph.Tests,TokenizerTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\TokenizerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HebMorph.HSpell.Tests,HSpellLoaderTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\HSpell\HSpellLoaderTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HebMorph.Lucene.Tests,HebrewQueryParserTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\Lucene\HebrewQueryParserTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,HebMorph.DataStructures.Tests,RadixTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\DataStructures\RadixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,HebMorph.DataStructures.Tests,GuidObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\DataStructures\RadixTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _guid
Insufficient Modularization,Lucene.Net.Analysis,HTMLStripCharFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\HTMLStripCharFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 32 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Lucene.Net.Analysis,HTMLStripCharFilter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\synhershko_HebMorph\dotNet\Tests\HebMorphTests\HTMLStripCharFilter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 149
