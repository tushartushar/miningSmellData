Imperative Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithmsGUI,GUI,F:\newReposMay17\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\GeneticAlgorithmsGUI\GUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: setzeRaumschiff
Unutilized Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithmsGUI,GUI,F:\newReposMay17\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\GeneticAlgorithmsGUI\GUI.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithmsGUI.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\GeneticAlgorithmsGUI\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
