Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithms,Chromosome<Gene>,C:\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\Chromosome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithms,Chromosome<Gene>,C:\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\Chromosome.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Chromosome<Gene> (C:\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\Chromosome.cs' [1' 26])' GeneticSimulation<Gene> (C:\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\GeneticSimulation.cs' [1' 26])' IRecombinationProvider (C:\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\IRecombinationProvider.cs' [1' 26])

Unnecessary Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithms,GenesIncompatibleException,C:\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\IRecombinationProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
