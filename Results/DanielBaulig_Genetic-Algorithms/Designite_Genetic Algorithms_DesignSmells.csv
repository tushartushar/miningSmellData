Unutilized Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithms,GeneticSimulation<Gene>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\GeneticSimulation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,GeneticAlgorithms,GenesIncompatibleException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\IRecombinationProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,GeneticAlgorithms,GeneticSimulation<Gene>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanielBaulig_Genetic-Algorithms\Genetic Algorithms\GeneticSimulation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SimulationTurn
