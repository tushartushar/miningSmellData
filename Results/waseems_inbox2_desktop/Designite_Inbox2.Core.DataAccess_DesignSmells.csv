Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,DatabaseUtil,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\DatabaseUtil.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,Migrate,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\Migrate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,SQLiteDataService,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SQLiteDataService (C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs' [50' 69])' SQLiteDataService (C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs' [129' 148])
Duplicate Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,SQLiteDataService,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SQLiteDataService (C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs' [84' 104])' SQLiteDataService (C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs' [107' 127])
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess.Query,QueryGenerator<T>,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\Query\QueryGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess.Query,QueryGenerator<T>,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\Query\QueryGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  QueryGenerator<T> (C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\Query\QueryGenerator.cs' [52' 72])' QueryGenerator<T> (C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\Query\QueryGenerator.cs' [149' 169])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess.Reflection,TableMap,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\Reflection\TableMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TableName' PrimaryKey' Columns
Insufficient Modularization,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,SQLiteDataService,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Missing Hierarchy,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,SQLiteDataService,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IDataServiceHooks' IDataServiceHooks (in method "Save" of class "SQLiteDataService").
Missing Hierarchy,Inbox2.Core.DataAccess,SQLiteDataService,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Core\DataAccess\SQLiteDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IDataServiceHooks' IDataServiceHooks (in method "Update" of class "SQLiteDataService").
