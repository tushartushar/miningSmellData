Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker,MainForm,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Handlers.Matchers,ContactMatcher,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Handlers\Matchers\ContactMatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Imperative Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Handlers.Matchers,MessageMatcher,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Handlers\Matchers\MessageMatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Match
Imperative Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Handlers.Matchers,ProfileMatcher,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Handlers\Matchers\ProfileMatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Imperative Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync,UserStatusParser,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Sync\UserStatusParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessStatusUpdate
Unnecessary Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveMessagesTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveMessagesTask.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IReversePagableChannel' IReversePagableChannel (in method "SetSelectionRange" of class "ReceiveMessagesTask").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync,SyncTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Sync\SyncTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync,SyncTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Sync\SyncTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks,Tasks,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Tasks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask
Missing Hierarchy,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveMessagesTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveMessagesTask.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IPagableChannel' IReversePagableChannel (in method "SetSelectionRange" of class "ReceiveMessagesTask").
