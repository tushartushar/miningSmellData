Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Handlers.Matchers,ContactMatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Handlers\Matchers\ContactMatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SavePerson which is more interested in members of the type: Person
Feature Envy,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Handlers.Matchers,ContactMatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Handlers\Matchers\ContactMatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SaveProfile which is more interested in members of the type: Profile
Feature Envy,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Handlers.Matchers,ProfileMatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Handlers\Matchers\ProfileMatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Execute which is more interested in members of the type: Message
Unnecessary Abstraction,Inbox2ClientWorker.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Unexploited Encapsulation,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveMessagesTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveMessagesTask.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IReversePagableChannel' IReversePagableChannel (in method "SetSelectionRange" of class "ReceiveMessagesTask").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync,SyncTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Sync\SyncTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Tasks' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask
Missing Hierarchy,Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive,ReceiveMessagesTask,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2ClientWorker\Core\Threading\Tasks\Receive\ReceiveMessagesTask.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IPagableChannel' IReversePagableChannel (in method "SetSelectionRange" of class "ReceiveMessagesTask").
