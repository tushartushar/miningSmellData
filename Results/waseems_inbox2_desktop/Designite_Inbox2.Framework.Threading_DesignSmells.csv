Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Inbox2.Framework.Threading,ConnectedCommand,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\ConnectedCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CanExecute
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2.Framework.Threading,CrossThreadRunner,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\CrossThreadRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2.Framework.Threading,DispatcherActivator<T>,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\DispatcherActivator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Inbox2.Framework.Threading.Progress,Progress,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\Progress\Progress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Wide Hierarchy,Inbox2.Framework.Threading,BackgroundTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\BackgroundTask.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Application.CheckForUpdateTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Application.PurgeDataTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Application.RemoveChannelTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Application.ShipLogTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Commands.CleanupCommandsTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Commands.ExecuteCommandsTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ProcessLabelsTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveMessageDetailsTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.UpdateMessageStateTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncContactsTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncSearchStreamTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncStatusUpdatesTask' Inbox2.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask' Inbox2.Framework.Threading.BackgroundActionTask' Inbox2.Framework.Threading.ChannelTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ProcessLabelsTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveMessageDetailsTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.ReceiveTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Receive.UpdateMessageStateTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncContactsTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncSearchStreamTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncStatusUpdatesTask' Inbox2ClientWorker.Core.Threading.Tasks.Sync.SyncTask
Missing Hierarchy,Inbox2.Framework.Threading,ChannelTask,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\ChannelTask.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IPoolableChannel' IPoolableChannel (in method "ExecuteCore" of class "ChannelTask").
Broken Hierarchy,Inbox2.Framework.Threading,ConnectedCommand,C:\repos\waseems_inbox2_desktop\Code\Client\Inbox2\Framework\Threading\ConnectedCommand.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Inbox2.Framework.Threading.CommandBase
