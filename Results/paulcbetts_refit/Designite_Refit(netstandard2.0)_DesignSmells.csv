Unutilized Abstraction,Refit,IRestService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\RestService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Refit,RestService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\RestService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Collections.Specialized,NameValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\NameValueCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AllKeys
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Collections.Specialized,NameValueCollection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\NameValueCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,System.Net.Http,PushStreamContent,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\PushStreamContent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Taskify
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Net.Http,AsyncVoid,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\PushStreamContent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Modularization,Refit,ProblemDetails,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\ProblemDetails.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Errors' Extensions' Type' Title' Status' Detail' Instance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Refit,ApiException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\ApiException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Refit.ApiException' Refit.ValidationApiException
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Refit,CollectionFormat,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\Attributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Refit.CollectionFormat' Refit.QueryAttribute' Refit.DefaultUrlParameterFormatter' Refit.RefitSettings
Cyclic Hierarchy,Refit,ApiException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\ApiException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: ValidationApiException
Multipath Hierarchy,Refit,CachedRequestBuilderImplementation<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\CachedRequestBuilderImplementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IRequestBuilder
Broken Hierarchy,Refit,CachedRequestBuilderImplementation<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\CachedRequestBuilderImplementation.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Refit.CachedRequestBuilderImplementation' Refit.IRequestBuilder
Multipath Hierarchy,Refit,RequestBuilderImplementation<TApi>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\RequestBuilderImplementation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IRequestBuilder
Broken Hierarchy,Refit,RequestBuilderImplementation<TApi>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\RequestBuilderImplementation.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Refit.RequestBuilderImplementation' Refit.IRequestBuilder
Broken Hierarchy,Refit,ValidationApiException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\Refit\ValidationApiException.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Refit.ApiException
