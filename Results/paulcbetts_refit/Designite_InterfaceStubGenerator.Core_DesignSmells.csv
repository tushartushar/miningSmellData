Unutilized Abstraction,Refit.Generator,InterfaceStubGenerator,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\InterfaceStubGenerator.Core\InterfaceStubGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Refit.Generator,UsingDeclaration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\paulcbetts_refit\InterfaceStubGenerator.Core\InterfaceStubGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Item
