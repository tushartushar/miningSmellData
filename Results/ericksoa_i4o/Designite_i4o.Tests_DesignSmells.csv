Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,i4o.Tests,CollectionModificationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\CollectionModificationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,i4o.Tests,IndexTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\IndexTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,i4o.Tests,SimpleClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\IndexTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Age' FavoriteColor
Unutilized Abstraction,i4o.Tests,PropertyReaderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\PropertyReaderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,i4o.Tests,FluentSpecificationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\TestingHelpers\FluentSpecificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,i4o.Tests,Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\IndexTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Green' Aqua
Deficient Encapsulation,i4o.Tests,Color,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\IndexTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Green' Aqua
Insufficient Modularization,i4o.Tests,FluentSpecificationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\TestingHelpers\FluentSpecificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,i4o.Tests,FluentSpecificationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ericksoa_i4o\i4o.Silverlight.Tests\TestingHelpers\FluentSpecificationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
