Insufficient Modularization,AtNet.DevFw.Data,DataBaseAccess,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\DataBaseAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,AtNet.DevFw.Data,DataBaseAccess,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\DataBaseAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,AtNet.DevFw.Data,DataBaseAccess,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\DataBaseAccess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 100
Insufficient Modularization,AtNet.DevFw.Data.Extensions,DataTableExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\Extensions\DataExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
Rebellious Hierarchy,AtNet.DevFw.Data,DataBaseFactory,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\IDataBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetConnection' CreateParameter' CreateCommand
Rebellious Hierarchy,AtNet.DevFw.Data,OleDbFactory,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\OleDbFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteScript
Rebellious Hierarchy,AtNet.DevFw.Data,SQLiteFactory,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\SQLiteFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteScript
Rebellious Hierarchy,AtNet.DevFw.Data,SqlServerFactory,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\SqlServerFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteScript
Rebellious Hierarchy,AtNet.DevFw.Data,MonoSQLiteFactory,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\MonoSQLiteFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteScript
Broken Hierarchy,AtNet.DevFw.Data.Orm,PrimaryKeyValueDictionary,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\src\core\AtNet.DevFw.Data\Orm\PriamaryKeyValueDictionary.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FieldValueDictionary
