Multifaceted Abstraction,Com.Plugin,RequestHandle,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\RequestHandle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Unutilized Abstraction,Com.Plugin.Core,Helper,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\Core\Helper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Com.Plugin.Core.Utils,ExportItem,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\Core\Utils\DataExport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Com.Plugin.Core.Utils,LocaledExcelExportProvider,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\Core\Utils\ExcelExportProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Com.Plugin,Conf,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\Conf.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DebugMode' DB_PREFIX
Deficient Encapsulation,Com.Plugin,Conf,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\Conf.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DebugMode' DB_PREFIX
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Com.Plugin,RequestProxry,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\RequestProxry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RequestProxry' RequestHandle
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Com.Plugin,RequestProxry,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\RequestProxry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RequestProxry' Main' RequestHandle
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Com.Plugin,Main,F:\newReposMay17\atnet_devfw\J6\src\examples\com.plugin.helloworld\Main.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
