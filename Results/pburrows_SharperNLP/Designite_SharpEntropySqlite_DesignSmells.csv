Imperative Abstraction,SharpEntropy.IO,SqliteGisModelWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\SharpEntropy\SharpEntropySqlite\SqliteGisModelWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Persist
Feature Envy,SharpEntropy.IO,SqliteGisModelWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\SharpEntropy\SharpEntropySqlite\SqliteGisModelWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateDataStructures which is more interested in members of the type: SQLiteCommand

Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpEntropy.IO,SqliteGisModelReader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\SharpEntropy\SharpEntropySqlite\SqliteGisModelReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetOutcomePatterns' GetPredicates
Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpEntropy.IO,SqliteGisModelWriter,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\SharpEntropy\SharpEntropySqlite\SqliteGisModelWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: WriteString' WriteInt32' WriteDouble
