Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SharpWordNet,IndexWord,D:\newReposJune17\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\OpenNLP\SharpWordNet\IndexWord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IndexWord[1' 21]' Relation[1' 21]' RelationType[1' 21]' Synset[1' 21]' Tokenizer[1' 21]
Imperative Abstraction,SharpWordNet.Morph,TokenizerOperation,D:\newReposJune17\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\OpenNLP\SharpWordNet\Morph\TokenizerOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpWordNet,Relation,D:\newReposJune17\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\OpenNLP\SharpWordNet\Relation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Relation' Synset
Rebellious Hierarchy,SharpWordNet.Morph,AbstractDelegatingOperation,D:\newReposJune17\pburrows_SharperNLP\SharpNLP-Original\SharpNLP\OpenNLP\SharpWordNet\Morph\AbstractDelegatingOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Execute
