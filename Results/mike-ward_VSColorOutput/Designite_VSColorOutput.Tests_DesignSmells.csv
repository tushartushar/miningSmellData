Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,BuildEventsProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\BuildEventsProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,BuildEventsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\BuildEventsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests,IDispBuildEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\BuildEventsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Unnecessary Abstraction,Tests,IDispDteEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\BuildEventsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,IDispDteEvents,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\BuildEventsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,ClassificationTypeDefinitionsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\ClassificationTypeDefinitionsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Tests,FakeTextSnapshot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\FakeTextSnapshot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FakeTextSnapshot (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\FakeTextSnapshot.cs' [95' 125])' FakeTextSnapshot (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\FakeTextSnapshot.cs' [247' 277])
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,FindResultsClassifierProviderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\FindResultsClassifierProviderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,FindResultsClassifierTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\FindResultsClassifierTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Tests,FindResultsClassifierTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\FindResultsClassifierTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Setup which is more interested in members of the type: FindResultsClassifier

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,OutputClassifierTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\OutputClassifierTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,RegExClassificationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\RegExClassificationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,Startup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mike-ward_VSColorOutput\VSColorOutput.Tests\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
