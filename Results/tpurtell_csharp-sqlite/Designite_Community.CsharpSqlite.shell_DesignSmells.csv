Imperative Abstraction,Community.CsharpSqlite,Shell,C:\repos\tpurtell_csharp-sqlite\Community.CsharpSqlite.shell\src\shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Multifaceted Abstraction,Community.CsharpSqlite,Shell,C:\repos\tpurtell_csharp-sqlite\Community.CsharpSqlite.shell\src\shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.96
Insufficient Modularization,Community.CsharpSqlite,Shell,C:\repos\tpurtell_csharp-sqlite\Community.CsharpSqlite.shell\src\shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 70 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Community.CsharpSqlite,Shell,C:\repos\tpurtell_csharp-sqlite\Community.CsharpSqlite.shell\src\shell.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 487
