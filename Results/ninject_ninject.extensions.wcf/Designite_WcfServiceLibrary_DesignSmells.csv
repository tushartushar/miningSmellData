Unnecessary Abstraction,WcfServiceLibrary.Contracts,ISystemClock,C:\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.wcf\src\Examples\WcfServiceLibrary\Contracts\ISystemClock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Time
Duplicate Abstraction,WcfServiceLibrary.Contracts,ISystemClock,C:\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.wcf\src\Examples\WcfServiceLibrary\Contracts\ISystemClock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ISystemClock (C:\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.wcf\src\Examples\WcfServiceLibrary\Contracts\ISystemClock.cs' [3' 24])' ITimeService (C:\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.wcf\src\Examples\WcfServiceLibrary\Contracts\ITimeService.cs' [3' 24])
Unutilized Abstraction,WcfServiceLibrary.Contracts,ITimeService,C:\repos\ninject_ninject.extensions.wcf\src\Examples\WcfServiceLibrary\Contracts\ITimeService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
