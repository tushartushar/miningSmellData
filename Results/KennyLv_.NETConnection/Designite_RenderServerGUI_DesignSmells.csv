Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,RenderBase,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Multifaceted Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,RenderBase,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Duplicate Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,RenderBase,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: RenderBase[238' 260]' RenderBase[408' 430]
Duplicate Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,RenderBase,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: RenderBase[275' 305]' RenderBase[445' 475]
Duplicate Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,RenderBase,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: RenderBase[359' 380]' RenderBase[516' 537]
Multifaceted Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,IP_Form,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\IP_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Unutilized Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,IP_Form,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\IP_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,IP_Form,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\IP_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IP_Form[21' 47]' Net_Form[26' 52]
Duplicate Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,IP_Form,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\IP_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IP_Form[49' 68]' Net_Form[74' 93]
Multifaceted Abstraction,RenderServerGUI,Net_Form,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Net_Form.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Insufficient Modularization,RenderServerGUI,RenderBase,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Base.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 101
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,RenderServerGUI,RenderEvents,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\RenderEvents.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RenderEvents' RenderEvents_Form
Broken Modularization,RenderServerGUI.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\KennyLv_.NETConnection\.NET TCP Demo\RenderServerGUI\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ConnectServerPort' ListenRenderPort' ConnectServerIp' Path' defaultInstance
