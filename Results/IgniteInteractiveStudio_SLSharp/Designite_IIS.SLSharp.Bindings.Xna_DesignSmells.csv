Unnecessary Abstraction,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.XNA,UniformStorage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Xna\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' F2' F3' F4' F4X4
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.XNA,UniformStorage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Xna\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: F2' F3' F4' F4X4
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.XNA,SLSharpBinding,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Xna\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
