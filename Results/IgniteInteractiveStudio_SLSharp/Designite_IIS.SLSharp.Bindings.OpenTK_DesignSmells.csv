Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,GpuStopwatch,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\GpuStopwatch.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.Externals,ImageDDS,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\Externals\LoaderDDS.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadFromDisk
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,UniformStorage,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: F2' F3' F4' D2' D3' D4' F4X4' D4X4' Sampler
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.Externals,TextureLoaderParameters,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\Externals\LoaderStatics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Verbose' OpenGLDefaultTexture' FlipImages' BuildMipmapsForUncompressed' MagnificationFilter' MinificationFilter' WrapModeS' WrapModeT' EnvMode
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.Externals,TextureLoaderParameters,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\Externals\LoaderStatics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Verbose' OpenGLDefaultTexture' FlipImages' BuildMipmapsForUncompressed' MagnificationFilter' MinificationFilter' WrapModeS' WrapModeT' EnvMode
Insufficient Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,SLSharp,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Broken Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,UniformStorage,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' F2' F3' F4' D2' D3' D4' F4X4' D4X4' Sampler
Broken Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.Externals,TextureLoaderParameters,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\Externals\LoaderStatics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Verbose' OpenGLDefaultTexture' Border' FlipImages' BuildMipmapsForUncompressed' MagnificationFilter' MinificationFilter' WrapModeS' WrapModeT' EnvMode
Broken Hierarchy,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures,Texture1D,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\Texture1D.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.TextureBase
Broken Hierarchy,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures,Texture2D,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\Texture2D.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.TextureBase
Broken Hierarchy,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures,TextureCube,C:\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK\Textures\TextureCube.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.TextureBase
