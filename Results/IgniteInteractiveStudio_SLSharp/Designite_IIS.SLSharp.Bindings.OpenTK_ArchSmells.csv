Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Unstable Dependency,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): IIS.SLSharp.Translation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.ITransform
Ambiguous Interface,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.Externals,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: ImageDDS,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.Textures.Externals.ImageDDS
Feature Concentration,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [GpuStopwatch]' [Program' SLSharpBinding' Quad]' [SLSharp' UniformStorage]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.SLSharp' IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.UniformStorage' IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.OpenTK.GpuStopwatch
