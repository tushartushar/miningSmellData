Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,Program,F:\newReposMay17\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentProgram' MatToProg
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,Program,F:\newReposMay17\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CurrentProgram' MatToProg
Insufficient Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,SLSharp,F:\newReposMay17\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,SLSharpBinding,F:\newReposMay17\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TexActivate' TexFinish' TexReset' Initialize' Cleanup' FullscreenQuad
