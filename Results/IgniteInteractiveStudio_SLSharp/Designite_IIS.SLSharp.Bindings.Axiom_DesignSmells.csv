Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CurrentProgram' MatToProg
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CurrentProgram' MatToProg
Deficient Encapsulation,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,UniformStorage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: F2' F3' F4' F3X3' F4X4' Sampler
Insufficient Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,SLSharp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Broken Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,UniformStorage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' F2' F3' F4' F3X3' F4X4' Sampler
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,SLSharpBinding,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom.SLSharpBinding' IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom.SLSharp
Rebellious Hierarchy,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,SLSharpBinding,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TexActivate' TexFinish' TexReset' Initialize' Cleanup' FullscreenQuad
Rebellious Hierarchy,IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\IgniteInteractiveStudio_SLSharp\IIS.SLSharp.Bindings.Axiom\Bindings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetAttributeIndex
