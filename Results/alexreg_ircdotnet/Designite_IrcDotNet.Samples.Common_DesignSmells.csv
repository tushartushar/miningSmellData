Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,IrcDotNet,IrcBotUtilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\samples\IrcDotNet.Samples.Common\IrcBotUtilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,IrcDotNet,ProgramInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\samples\IrcDotNet.Samples.Common\ProgramInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AssemblyTitle' AssemblyCopyright' AssemblyVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,IrcDotNet,ProgramInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\samples\IrcDotNet.Samples.Common\ProgramInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,IrcDotNet,IrcBot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\samples\IrcDotNet.Samples.Common\IrcBot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Missing Hierarchy,IrcDotNet,IrcBot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\samples\IrcDotNet.Samples.Common\IrcBot.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IIrcMessageTarget' IIrcMessageTarget (in method "ReadChatCommand" of class "IrcBot").
