Unutilized Abstraction,IrcDotNet.Test,IrcClientTestSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\test\IrcDotNet.Test\IrcClientTestSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,IrcDotNet.Test,IrcClientTestSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\test\IrcDotNet.Test\IrcClientTestSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,IrcDotNet.Test,IrcClientTestSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\test\IrcDotNet.Test\IrcClientTestSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 101 methods
Insufficient Modularization,IrcDotNet.Test,IrcClientTestSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\alexreg_ircdotnet\test\IrcDotNet.Test\IrcClientTestSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
