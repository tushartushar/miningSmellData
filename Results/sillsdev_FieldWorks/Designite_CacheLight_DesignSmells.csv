Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,RealCacheLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,RealCacheLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RealCacheLoader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs' [35' 69])' IRealDataCache (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealDataCache.cs' [1923' 1957])
Duplicate Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,RealCacheLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RealCacheLoader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs' [71' 120])' IRealDataCache (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealDataCache.cs' [1959' 2008])
Feature Envy,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,RealCacheLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadCmObjectProperties which is more interested in members of the type: RealDataCache
Unnecessary Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,IRealDataCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealDataCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ParaContentsFlid' ParaPropertiesFlid' TextParagraphsFlid
Deficient Encapsulation,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,MetaClassRec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\MetaDataCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_superclassName' m_baseClsid' m_abstract' m_className' m_fields' m_directSubclasses
Deficient Encapsulation,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,MetaFieldRec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\MetaDataCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_fieldType' m_ownClsid' m_dstClsid' m_fieldName' m_fieldLabel' m_fieldHelp' m_fieldWs' m_fieldXml' m_sig' m_fType
Deficient Encapsulation,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,ClidFieldnameKey,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\RealCacheLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_clid' m_fieldname
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,MetaDataCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\MetaDataCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,MetaDataCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\MetaDataCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.CacheLight,MetaDataCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\CacheLight\MetaDataCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
