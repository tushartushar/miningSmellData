Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,HCLoaderTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\ParserCoreTests\HCLoaderTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
