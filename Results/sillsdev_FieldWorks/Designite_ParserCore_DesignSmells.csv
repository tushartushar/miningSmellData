Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,HCLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\HCLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Load
Unnecessary Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,MorphInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\HCParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Form' String' Msa' InflType' IsCircumfix
Imperative Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,ParseFiler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\ParseFiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessParse
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,ParserScheduler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\ParserScheduler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,ParserXmlWriterExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\ParserXmlWriterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,FwXmlTraceManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\FwXmlTraceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,FwXmlTraceManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\FwXmlTraceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 33 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,HCLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\HCLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 76 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,HCLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\HCLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 411
Broken Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,MorphInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\HCParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Form' String' Msa' InflType' IsCircumfix
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser,FwXmlTraceManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\ParserCore\FwXmlTraceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser.FwXmlTraceManager' SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser.HCParser
