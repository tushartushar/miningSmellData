Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,XCore,PropertyTableTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\PropertyTableTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XCore,TestMessageSequencer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\TestMessageSequencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XCore,TestMessagePriority,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\TestMessageSequencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,XCore,TestTupleComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\TestTupleComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,XCore,ClassB,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\TestTupleComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,XCore,TestControlBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\TestMessageSequencer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_messages
Broken Hierarchy,XCore,ClassB,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\xCoreInterfaces\xCoreInterfacesTests\TestTupleComparer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XCore.ClassA
