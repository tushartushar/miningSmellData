Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ParatextHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ParatextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ParatextHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ParatextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetAssociatedProject which is more interested in members of the type: IParatextHelper
Feature Envy,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ParatextHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ParatextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: IsProjectWritable which is more interested in members of the type: IParatextHelper
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,Manager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ParatextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,IScriptureProviderMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScriptureProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Version
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ScriptureReferenceComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScriptureReferenceComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ScriptureReferenceComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScriptureReferenceComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ScriptureReferenceComparer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScriptureReferenceComparer.cs' [64' 85])' ScrReferencePositionComparer (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScrReferencePositionComparer.cs' [49' 70])
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ScrReferencePositionComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScrReferencePositionComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ReferencePositionType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScrReferencePositionComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_reference' m_iSection' m_iPara' m_ich
Broken Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,IUsfmToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ParatextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Marker' EndMarker' Type' CoreToken' Text
Missing Hierarchy,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.ScriptureUtils,ScrReferencePositionComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\Common\ScriptureUtils\ScrReferencePositionComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ReferencePositionType' ReferencePositionType (in method "Compare" of class "ScrReferencePositionComparer").
