Insufficient Modularization,FDOBrowser,FDOBrowserForm,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\FDOBrowserForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FDOBrowser,FDOBrowserForm,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\FDOBrowserForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 184
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FDOBrowser,FDOBrowserForm,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\FDOBrowserForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FDOBrowser.FDOBrowserForm' FDOBrowser.ModelWnd
Insufficient Modularization,FDOBrowser,FdoInspectorList,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\FdoInspectorList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FDOBrowser,FdoInspectorList,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\FdoInspectorList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FDOBrowser.FdoInspectorList' FDOBrowser.FDOBrowserForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FDOBrowser,FdoInspectorList,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\FdoInspectorList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FDOBrowser.FdoInspectorList' FDOBrowser.FDOBrowserForm' FDOBrowser.ModelWnd
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FDOBrowser,ModelWnd,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\ModelWnd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FDOBrowser.ModelWnd' FDOBrowser.FDOBrowserForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FDOBrowser,ModelWnd,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\ModelWnd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FDOBrowser.ModelWnd' FDOBrowser.FDOBrowserForm' FDOBrowser.FdoInspectorList
Broken Modularization,FDOBrowser.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FDOBrowser\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ShowCmObjectProperties' ModelWndSplitterLocation' ModelWndCol0Width' ModelWndCol1Width' ModelWndCol3Width' ModelWndCol4Width' ModelWndCol2Width' defaultInstance
