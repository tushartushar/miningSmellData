Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdater,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  XUpdater (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs' [367' 389])' XUpdater (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs' [419' 441])
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XDumper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 117 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XDumper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 566
