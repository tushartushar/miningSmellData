Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XDumper,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdater,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UpdateFXTResult
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdater,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdater,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  XUpdater (C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs' [367' 389])' XUpdater (C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs' [419' 441])
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdaterException,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XDumper,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 117 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XDumper,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XDumper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 413
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdater,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods

Broken Hierarchy,SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT,XUpdater,C:\repos\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\FXT\FxtDll\XUpdater.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SIL.FieldWorks.Common.FXT.XDumper
