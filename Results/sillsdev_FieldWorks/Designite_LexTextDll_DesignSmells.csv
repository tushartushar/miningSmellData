Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,AreaListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\AreaListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,AreaListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\AreaListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AreaListener (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\AreaListener.cs' [96' 118])' LexTextApp (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\LexTextApp.cs' [128' 150])
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,FlexHelpTopicProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\FlexHelpTopicProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,ImageHolder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\ImageHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CheckDisposed
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,ImageHolder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\ImageHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,SampleCitationFormTransducer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\TransductionSample.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,ImageHolder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\ImageHolder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: largeImages' smallImages' smallCommandImages
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,AreaListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\AreaListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,AreaListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\AreaListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,LexTextApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\LexTextApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 26 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.XWorks.LexText,LexTextApp,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\LexText\LexTextDll\LexTextApp.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
