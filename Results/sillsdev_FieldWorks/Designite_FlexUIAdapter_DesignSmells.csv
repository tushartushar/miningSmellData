Imperative Abstraction,XCore,BarAdapterBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\BarAdapterBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: IsAcceptableShortcut
Duplicate Abstraction,XCore,BarAdapterBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\BarAdapterBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BarAdapterBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\BarAdapterBase.cs' [208' 227])' BarAdapterBase (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\BarAdapterBase.cs' [272' 291])
Unutilized Abstraction,XCore,ContextHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\ContextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,XCore,SidebarAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\NavBarAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: XCore.SidebarAdapter' XCoreUnused.SidebarAdapter
Unutilized Abstraction,XCore,PaneBar,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\PaneBar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,XCoreUnused,PanelCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\SidebarAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_panels
Rebellious Hierarchy,XCore,ContextHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\ContextHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SetHelps
Rebellious Hierarchy,XCore,SidebarAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\NavBarAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PersistLayout' OnIdle
Rebellious Hierarchy,XCore,ReBarAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\ToolbarAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: PersistLayout
Rebellious Hierarchy,XCoreUnused,SidebarAdapter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\XCore\FlexUIAdapter\SidebarAdapter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateUIForChoiceGroupCollection' CreateUIForChoiceGroup' OnIdle
