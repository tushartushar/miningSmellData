Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,ErrorCodesExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\ErrorCodes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Main
Unnecessary Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,UndoFiles,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\PUAInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' m_backupFile' m_originalFile
Unnecessary Abstraction,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,UndoFiles,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\PUAInstaller.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_backupFile' m_originalFile
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,CustomCharDlg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\CustomCharDlg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,CustomCharDlg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\CustomCharDlg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 134
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor,CharEditorWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sillsdev_FieldWorks\Src\UnicodeCharEditor\CharEditorWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor.CharEditorWindow' SIL.FieldWorks.UnicodeCharEditor.CustomCharDlg
