Scattered Functionality,NGitHub,NGitHub.Services,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: NGitHub.Web' NGitHub,NGitHub.Web.Parameter' NGitHub.IGitHubClient
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.67  All the dependencies among components: from: NGitHub' to: NGitHub.Utility' from: NGitHub' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub' to: NGitHub.Models' from: NGitHub' to: NGitHub.Helpers' from: NGitHub' to: NGitHub.Services' from: NGitHub.Authentication' to: NGitHub.Helpers' from: NGitHub.Authentication' to: NGitHub.Utility' from: NGitHub.Authentication' to: NGitHub' from: NGitHub.Helpers' to: NGitHub' from: NGitHub.Helpers' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub.Helpers' to: NGitHub.Utility' from: NGitHub.Services' to: NGitHub.Models' from: NGitHub.Services' to: NGitHub' from: NGitHub.Services' to: NGitHub.Utility' from: NGitHub.Services' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub.Web' to: NGitHub.Utility' from: NGitHub.Web' to: NGitHub.Models' from: NGitHub.Utility' to: NGitHub.Models' from: NGitHub.Test.Authentication' to: NGitHub.Authentication' from: NGitHub.Test.Authentication' to: NGitHub.Helpers' from: NGitHub.Test.Authentication' to: NGitHub' from: NGitHub.Test.Authentication' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub.Test' to: NGitHub' from: NGitHub.Test' to: NGitHub.Helpers' from: NGitHub.Test' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub.Test' to: NGitHub.Authentication' from: NGitHub.Test.Helpers' to: NGitHub' from: NGitHub.Test.Helpers' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub.Test.Helpers' to: NGitHub.Helpers' from: NGitHub.Test.Services' to: NGitHub.Services' from: NGitHub.Test.Services' to: NGitHub.Test.Helpers' from: NGitHub.Test.Services' to: NGitHub.Models.Dto' from: NGitHub.Test.Services' to: NGitHub.Web' from: NGitHub.Test.Services' to: NGitHub.,NGitHub.GitHubRequestAsyncHandle' NGitHub.GitHubException' NGitHub.Constants' NGitHub.GitHubClient' NGitHub.GitHubClient' NGitHub.Test.Services.IssueServiceTests' NGitHub.Test.Services.IssueServiceTests' NGitHub.Test.Services.IssueServiceTests' NGitHub.Test.Services.PullRequestServiceTests' NGitHub.Test.Services.PullRequestServiceTests
