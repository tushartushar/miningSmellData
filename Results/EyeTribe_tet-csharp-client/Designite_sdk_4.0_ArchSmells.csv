Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,sdk_4.0,EyeTribe.ClientSdk,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: EyeTribe.ClientSdk' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.GazeApiManager' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.IncomingStreamHandler' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.GazeManagerCore' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.CalibrationPointEndRequest' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.TrackerGetRequest
Unstable Dependency,sdk_4.0,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): EyeTribe.ClientSdk,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.Protocol
Feature Concentration,sdk_4.0,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Data,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Accuracy' CalibrationPoint' CalibrationResult' MeanError' Point2D' StandardDeviation' Eye' GazeData]' [Point3D]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Data.Point3D
Feature Concentration,sdk_4.0,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CalibrationPointEndRequest]' [CalibrationPointStartRequest]' [CalibrationPointStartRequestValues]' [CalibrationStartRequest]' [CalibrationStartRequestValues]' [IRequest' RequestBase<T>]' [TrackerGetRequest]' [TrackerSetRequest]' [TrackerSetRequestValues]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.9,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.CalibrationPointEndRequest' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.CalibrationPointStartRequest' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.CalibrationPointStartRequestValues' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.CalibrationStartRequest' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.CalibrationStartRequestValues' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.TrackerGetRequest' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.TrackerSetRequest' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Request.TrackerSetRequestValues
Feature Concentration,sdk_4.0,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Response,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CalibrationPointEndResponse' ResponseBase' ResponseFailed' TrackerGetResponse]' [CalibrationPointEndResponseValues]' [ResponseFailedValues]' [TrackerGetResponseValues]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.57,EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Response.CalibrationPointEndResponseValues' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Response.ResponseFailedValues' EyeTribe.ClientSdk.Response.TrackerGetResponseValues
