List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EtherConfigSection[435' 455]' EtherConfigSection[673' 693]
Unutilized Abstraction,Codestellation.Ether.Config,MailingRulesConfigElementCollection,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\Config\ConfigSectionDesigner.csd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Codestellation.Ether.Config,GroupConfigElementCollection,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\Config\ConfigSectionDesigner.csd.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Codestellation.Ether.Core,Extentions,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\Core\Extentions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Codestellation.Ether.Templating.Razor,DynamicRazorMailTemplate,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\Templating\Razor\DynamicRazorMailTemplate.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Codestellation.Ether,InMemoryMailNotifier,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\InMemoryMailNotifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Codestellation.Ether.Misc,PersistentQueue,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\Misc\PersistentQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ImmediatelyFlush
Deficient Encapsulation,Codestellation.Ether,InMemoryMailNotifier,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\InMemoryMailNotifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Global
Deficient Encapsulation,Codestellation.Ether,InMemoryMailNotifier,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\InMemoryMailNotifier.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Global
Broken Hierarchy,Codestellation.Ether.Templating.Razor,DynamicRazorMailTemplate,C:\repos\Codestellation_Ether\Ether\Templating\Razor\DynamicRazorMailTemplate.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RazorMailTemplate
