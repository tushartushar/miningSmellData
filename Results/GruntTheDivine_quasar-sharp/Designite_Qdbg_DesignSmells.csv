Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,GruntXProductions.Quasar.Debugger,DebugClient,C:\repos\GruntTheDivine_quasar-sharp\src\Qdbg\DebugClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Deficient Encapsulation,GruntXProductions.Phosphorus,Operand,C:\repos\GruntTheDivine_quasar-sharp\src\Qdbg\Disassembler\Operand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value' OperandAddressingMode
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GruntXProductions.Quasar.Debugger,CommandHandler,C:\repos\GruntTheDivine_quasar-sharp\src\Qdbg\CommandHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CommandHandler' DebugClient
Unfactored Hierarchy,GruntXProductions.Quasar.Debugger,PacketEvent,C:\repos\GruntTheDivine_quasar-sharp\src\Qdbg\PacketEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: PacketEvent[23' 57]' PacketRequest[23' 57]
