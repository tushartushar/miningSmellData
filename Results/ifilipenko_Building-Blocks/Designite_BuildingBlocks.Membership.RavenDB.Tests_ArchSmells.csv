Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MembershipSettings' RoleRepositorySteps' RoleStorageSteps' UserRepositorySteps' UsersStorageSteps]' [StringToBoolTransform]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.StringToBoolTransform,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.MembershipSettings' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.RoleRepositorySteps' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.RoleStorageSteps' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.StringToBoolTransform' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.UserRepositorySteps' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps.UsersStorageSteps
Scattered Functionality,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.Tests.Steps,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: BuildingBlocks.Store' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB,BuildingBlocks.Store.IStorageSession' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.UserRepositoryImpl,BuildingBlocks.Store.IStorageSession' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.UserRepositoryImpl
