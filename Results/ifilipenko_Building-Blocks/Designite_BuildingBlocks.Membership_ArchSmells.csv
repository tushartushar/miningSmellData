Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes,Participating Classes
Feature Concentration,BuildingBlocks.Membership,BuildingBlocks.Membership,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConfigHelper]' [IForcedPasswordChangeProvider' MembershipProvider' MembershipProviderException' MembershipUpdateUserException' ProviderHelpers' RoleProvider' RepositoryFactory' Crypto]' [LogExtentions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.3,BuildingBlocks.Membership.ConfigHelper' BuildingBlocks.Membership.LogExtentions,BuildingBlocks.Membership.ConfigHelper' BuildingBlocks.Membership.IForcedPasswordChangeProvider' BuildingBlocks.Membership.LogExtentions' BuildingBlocks.Membership.MembershipProvider' BuildingBlocks.Membership.MembershipProviderException' BuildingBlocks.Membership.MembershipUpdateUserException' BuildingBlocks.Membership.ProviderHelpers' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RoleProvider' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RepositoryFactory' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Crypto
Scattered Functionality,BuildingBlocks.Membership,BuildingBlocks.Membership,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: BuildingBlocks.Common' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Contract' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Entities,BuildingBlocks.Common.StringExtentions' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Contract.IUserRepository' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Contract.IRoleRepository' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Entities.User,BuildingBlocks.Common.StringExtentions' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Contract.IUserRepository' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Contract.IRoleRepository' BuildingBlocks.Membership.Entities.User
