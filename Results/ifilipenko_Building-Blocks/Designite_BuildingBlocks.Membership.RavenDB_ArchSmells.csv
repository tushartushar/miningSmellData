Scattered Functionality,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB,BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: BuildingBlocks.Store' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.DomainModel,BuildingBlocks.Store.IStorageSession' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.DomainModel.UserEntity' BuildingBlocks.Store.IUnitOfWork,BuildingBlocks.Store.IStorageSession' BuildingBlocks.Membership.RavenDB.DomainModel.UserEntity' BuildingBlocks.Store.IUnitOfWork
