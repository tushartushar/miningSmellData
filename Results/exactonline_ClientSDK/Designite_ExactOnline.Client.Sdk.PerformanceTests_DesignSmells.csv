Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests,ApiCallTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\ApiCallTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests,ApiCallTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\ApiCallTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestPerformanceApiCallPut which is more interested in members of the type: TestObjectsCreator
Feature Envy,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests,ApiCallTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\ApiCallTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestPerformanceApiCallDelete which is more interested in members of the type: TestObjectsCreator
Unutilized Abstraction,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests,JsonToObjectTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\JsonToObjectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests,JsonToObjectTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\JsonToObjectTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  JsonToObjectTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\JsonToObjectTest.cs' [306' 328])' JsonToObjectTest (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\JsonToObjectTest.cs' [432' 454])
Unutilized Abstraction,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests,ObjectToJsonTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\ObjectToJsonTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\exactonline_ClientSDK\test\ExactOnline.Client.Sdk.PerformanceTests\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
