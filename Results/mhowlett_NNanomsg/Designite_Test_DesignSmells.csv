Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Test,Test_WriteStream,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_WriteStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Test_WriteStream (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_WriteStream.cs' [52' 71])' Test_Pair (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_Pair.cs' [51' 70])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test,TestConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\TestConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Iterations' DataSize
Imperative Abstraction,Test,Test_SocketObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_SocketObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Execute
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,Test_WCF,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_WCF.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Binding' ServiceUri' Service
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,Test_WCF,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_WCF.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Binding' ServiceUri' Service
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Test,Test_WCF,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mhowlett_NNanomsg\Test\Test_WCF.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Test.Test_WCF' Test.ServiceProxy
