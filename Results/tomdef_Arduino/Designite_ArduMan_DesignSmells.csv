Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,ArduMan,ResourceMessages,C:\repos\tomdef_Arduino\ArduMan\ArduMan\ResourceMessages.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: ResourceMessages[43' 63]' Resources[43' 63]
Unutilized Abstraction,ArduMan.Controls,LogControl,C:\repos\tomdef_Arduino\ArduMan\ArduMan\Controls\LogControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ArduMan.Exceptions,PluginExceptionResolver,C:\repos\tomdef_Arduino\ArduMan\ArduMan\Exceptions\PluginExceptionResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ArduMan.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\tomdef_Arduino\ArduMan\ArduMan\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Hierarchy,ArduMan.Plugin,SensorPluginProvider,C:\repos\tomdef_Arduino\ArduMan\ArduMan\Plugin\SensorPluginProvider.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BasePluginProvider
