Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Monitor,Hotkey,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\Hotkey.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.94
Multifaceted Abstraction,Monitor,ProcessMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\ProcessMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.95
Multifaceted Abstraction,Monitor,Monitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83
Multifaceted Abstraction,Monitor,Reporter,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\Reporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Deficient Encapsulation,Monitor,ProcessMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\ProcessMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SWP_NOSIZE
Deficient Encapsulation,Monitor,ProcessMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\ProcessMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: SWP_NOSIZE
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Monitor,ClientMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\ClientMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ClientMonitor' Client
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Monitor,ClientMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\ClientMonitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ClientMonitor' Client' Reporter
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Monitor,Reporter,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\Reporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Reporter' ClientMonitor' Client' ClientMonitor' Client
Broken Hierarchy,Monitor,ChimeraMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\ChimeraMonitor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ProcessMonitor
Broken Hierarchy,Monitor,OpenSimMonitor,C:\repos\JohnMcCaffery_Monitor\Monitor\OpenSimMonitor.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ProcessMonitor
