Deficient Encapsulation,ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer.Test,DiagnosticEqualityComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer\ClrHeapAllocationsAnalyzer.Test\DiagnosticEqualityComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Instance
Deficient Encapsulation,ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer.Test,DiagnosticEqualityComparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer\ClrHeapAllocationsAnalyzer.Test\DiagnosticEqualityComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Instance
Broken Modularization,ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer.Test,Info,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer\ClrHeapAllocationsAnalyzer.Test\AllocationAnalyzerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Options' Tree' Compilation' Diagnostics' SemanticModel' Matches' Allocations
Insufficient Modularization,ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer.Test,TypeConversionAllocationAnalyzerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mjsabby_RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer\ClrHeapAllocationsAnalyzer.Test\TypeConversionAllocationAnalyzerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
