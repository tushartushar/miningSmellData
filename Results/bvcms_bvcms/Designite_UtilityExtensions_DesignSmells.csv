Unutilized Abstraction,IronPythonUtilities,ConfigurationProxy,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\ConfigurationProxy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.92
Unutilized Abstraction,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,UtilityExtensions,ConfigurationElementCollection,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\GenericConfigCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,UtilityExtensions.Extensions,Extensions,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\Extensions\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,UtilityExtensions.Extensions,XmlExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\Extensions\Extensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CreateAccountCode
Deficient Encapsulation,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CreateAccountCode
Insufficient Modularization,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 201 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 209 methods
Insufficient Modularization,UtilityExtensions,Util,F:\newReposMay17\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 354
