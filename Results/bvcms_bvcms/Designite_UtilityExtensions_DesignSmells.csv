Deficient Encapsulation,UtilityExtensions,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CreateAccountCode
Deficient Encapsulation,UtilityExtensions,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CreateAccountCode
Insufficient Modularization,UtilityExtensions,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 226 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,UtilityExtensions,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 236 methods
Insufficient Modularization,UtilityExtensions,Util,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\bvcms_bvcms\UtilityExtensions\EnDeCrypt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 511
