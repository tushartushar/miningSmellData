Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,TSqlFlex.Core,FlexResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FlexResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: visibleColumnCount' schema' exceptions' data' recordsAffected
Unutilized Abstraction,TSqlFlex.Core,Logging,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,TSqlFlex.Core,QueryWorker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\QueryWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoSqlQueryWork
Unutilized Abstraction,TSqlFlex.Core,QueryWorker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\QueryWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,TSqlFlex.Core,Info,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\Utils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TSqlFlex.Core,FlexResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FlexResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: schema' exceptions' data' recordsAffected
Deficient Encapsulation,TSqlFlex.Core,FlexResultSet,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FlexResultSet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: results' exceptions
Deficient Encapsulation,TSqlFlex.Core,Logging,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\Logging.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: config' lastException
Deficient Encapsulation,TSqlFlex.Core,SqlRunParameters,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\SqlRunParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: connStringBuilder' sqlToRun' outputType' exceptionsText' resultsText' exceptionCount' worksheetIsValid' completedResultsCount' outputFiles' command
Insufficient Modularization,TSqlFlex.Core,FieldScripting,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FieldScripting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,TSqlFlex.Core,FieldScripting,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FieldScripting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
Insufficient Modularization,TSqlFlex.Core,FieldScripting,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FieldScripting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 133
Broken Modularization,TSqlFlex.Core,FlexResult,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\FlexResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: visibleColumnCount' schema' exceptions' data' recordsAffected
Broken Modularization,TSqlFlex.Core,SQLColumn,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\SQLColumn.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ColumnName' BaseTableName' ColumnSize' NumericPrecision' NumericScale' DataType' AllowNulls' IsHidden
Missing Hierarchy,TSqlFlex.Core,QueryWorker,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex.Core\QueryWorker.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: SqlResultProcessingException' SqlExecutionException (in method "renderAndCountExceptions" of class "QueryWorker").
