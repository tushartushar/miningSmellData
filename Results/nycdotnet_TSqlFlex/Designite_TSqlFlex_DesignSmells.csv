Unutilized Abstraction,TSqlFlex,Extension,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex\Extension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,TSqlFlex,FlexMainWindow,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex\FlexMainWindow.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FlexMainWindow (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex\FlexMainWindow.cs' [308' 347])' FlexMainWindow (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nycdotnet_TSqlFlex\Code\TSqlFlex\FlexMainWindow.cs' [350' 389])
