Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,CMcG.CodeAlignment,UnmanagedExports,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\UnmanagedExports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Deficient Encapsulation,CMcG.CodeAlignment,UnmanagedExports,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\UnmanagedExports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: lineCountCallback' selectionStartCallback' selectionEndCallback' getColumnCallback' useTabsCallback' tabWidthCallback' fileTypeCallback' positionFromLineCallback' getLineCallback' startUndoActionCallback' endUndoActionCallback' insertTextCallback
Deficient Encapsulation,CMcG.CodeAlignment,UnmanagedExports,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\UnmanagedExports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: lineCountCallback' selectionStartCallback' selectionEndCallback' getColumnCallback' useTabsCallback' tabWidthCallback' fileTypeCallback' positionFromLineCallback' getLineCallback' startUndoActionCallback' endUndoActionCallback' insertTextCallback
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CMcG.CodeAlignment,Document,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\Implementations\Document.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CMcG.CodeAlignment.Document' CMcG.CodeAlignment.UnmanagedExports
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CMcG.CodeAlignment,Document,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\Implementations\Document.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CMcG.CodeAlignment.Document' CMcG.CodeAlignment.UnmanagedExports' CMcG.CodeAlignment.Edit
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CMcG.CodeAlignment,Line,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\Implementations\Line.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CMcG.CodeAlignment.Line' CMcG.CodeAlignment.Document' CMcG.CodeAlignment.UnmanagedExports
Rebellious Hierarchy,CMcG.CodeAlignment,Document,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignmentGenericCallbacks\Implementations\Document.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Refresh
