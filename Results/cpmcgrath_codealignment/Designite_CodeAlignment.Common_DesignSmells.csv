Unutilized Abstraction,CMcG.CodeAlignment,AboutData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignment.Common\AboutData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,CMcG.CodeAlignment,AlignFunctions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignment.Common\AlignFunctions.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateAlignment which is more interested in members of the type: Options
Feature Envy,CMcG.CodeAlignment.Business,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignment.Common\Business\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Reload which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
Feature Envy,CMcG.CodeAlignment.Business,Options,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\cpmcgrath_codealignment\CodeAlignment.Common\Business\Options.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Save which is more interested in members of the type: Settings
