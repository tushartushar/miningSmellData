Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,CodeAlignment.Common,CMcG.CodeAlignment,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: CMcG.CodeAlignment' CMcG.CodeAlignment.Interactions
Unstable Dependency,CodeAlignment.Common,CMcG.CodeAlignment,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CMcG.CodeAlignment' CMcG.CodeAlignment
Unstable Dependency,CodeAlignment.Common,CMcG.CodeAlignment.Business,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CMcG.CodeAlignment
