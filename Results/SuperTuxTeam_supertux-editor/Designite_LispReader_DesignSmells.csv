Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,LispReader,LispChildsAttribute,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ListType' Name' Type' _listType
Deficient Encapsulation,LispReader,LispRootAttribute,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name
Deficient Encapsulation,LispReader,LispCustomSerializerAttribute,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type
Deficient Encapsulation,LispReader,LispChildAttribute,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Translatable' Optional' Transient' Default' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,LispReader,LispChildsAttribute,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispAttributes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Type
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LispReader,LispRootSerializer,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispRootSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LispRootSerializer' LispSerializer
Missing Hierarchy,LispReader,LispRootSerializer,C:\repos\SuperTuxTeam_supertux-editor\LispReader\LispRootSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: List' ICustomLispSerializer (in method "Read" of class "LispRootSerializer").
