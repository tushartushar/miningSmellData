Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell,ShellDescriptionAttribute,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\ShellDescriptionAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell,Prompt,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\Prompt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell,Prompt,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\Prompt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Prompt[166' 188]' Prompt[197' 219]
Multifaceted Abstraction,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\getline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.89
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\getline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HeuristicsMode' AutoCompleteEvent
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\getline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 55 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\getline.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 155
Broken Hierarchy,Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell.Commands,AddCommand,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\Commands\AddCommand.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Command
Broken Hierarchy,Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell.Commands,StashCommand,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\Commands\StashCommand.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Command
Broken Hierarchy,Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell,ShellCommandLineParser,C:\repos\NtreevSoft_CommandLineParser\Ntreev.Library.Commands.Shell\ShellCommandLineParser.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CommandLineParser
