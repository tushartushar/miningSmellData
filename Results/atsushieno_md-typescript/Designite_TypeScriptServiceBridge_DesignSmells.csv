Unnecessary Abstraction,TypeScriptServiceBridge,JurassicTypeHosting,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\JurassicTypeHosting.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Engine' engine
Unnecessary Abstraction,TypeScriptServiceBridge,DangerousDefaultValueAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Runtime\DangerousDefaultValueAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,TypeScriptServiceBridge,DangerousDefaultValueAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Runtime\DangerousDefaultValueAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,NodeLanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\NodeLanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NodeCommandLocator' StandardOutputReceived' StandardErrorReceived
Deficient Encapsulation,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,NodeLanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\NodeLanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NodeCommandLocator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,JurassicLanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\JurassicLanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.JurassicLanguageServiceHost' TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.LanguageServiceHost
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,NodeLanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\NodeLanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.NodeLanguageServiceHost' TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.LanguageServiceHost
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,JurassicLanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\JurassicLanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.JurassicLanguageServiceHost' TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.LanguageServiceHost' TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting.NodeLanguageServiceHost
Rebellious Hierarchy,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,JurassicLanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\JurassicLanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddReference' Release
Cyclic Hierarchy,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,LanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\LanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: JurassicLanguageServiceHost
Cyclic Hierarchy,TypeScriptServiceBridge.Hosting,LanguageServiceHost,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Hosting\LanguageServiceHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: NodeLanguageServiceHost
Broken Hierarchy,TypeScriptServiceBridge,TypeScriptArray<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\atsushieno_md-typescript\bridge\Runtime\TypeScriptArray.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TypeScriptServiceBridge.TypeScriptObject
