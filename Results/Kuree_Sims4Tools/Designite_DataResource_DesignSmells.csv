Unnecessary Abstraction,s4pi.DataResource,DataResourceFlags,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Wrappers\DataResource\DataFlags.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DataSizeTable
Unutilized Abstraction,s4pi.DataResource,DataEntry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Wrappers\DataResource\DataValueClasses.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
