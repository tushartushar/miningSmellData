Deficient Encapsulation,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,MainWindow,C:\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: GeostateDictionary' MeshDictionary
Deficient Encapsulation,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,MainWindow,C:\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: GeostateDictionary' MeshDictionary
Unexploited Encapsulation,s3piwrappers.ModelViewer,MainWindow,C:\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pe Helpers\ModelViewer\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MATD' MTST (in method "FindMainMATD" of class "MainWindow").
