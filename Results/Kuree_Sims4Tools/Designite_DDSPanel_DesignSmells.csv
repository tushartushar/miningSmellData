Imperative Abstraction,System.Drawing,Dds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Write
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Drawing,Dds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Dds (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsFile.cs' [1' 21])' DdsSquish (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsSquish.cs' [1' 21])' ColorHSVA (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\RGBHSV.cs' [1' 21])' DDSPanel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DDSPanel.cs' [1' 21])
Feature Envy,System.Drawing,Dds,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsFile.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Dds which is more interested in members of the type: DdsHeader

Multifaceted Abstraction,System.Drawing,DdsPixelFormat,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Drawing,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Kuree_Sims4Tools\s4pi Extras\DDSPanel\DdsFile.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
