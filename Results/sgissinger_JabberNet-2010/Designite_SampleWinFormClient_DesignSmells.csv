Feature Envy,SampleWinFormClient,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgissinger_JabberNet-2010\SampleWinFormClient\MainForm.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: jc_OnAuthError which is more interested in members of the type: JabberClient
Feature Envy,SampleWinFormClient,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgissinger_JabberNet-2010\SampleWinFormClient\MainForm.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: jc_OnIQ which is more interested in members of the type: JabberClient
Feature Envy,SampleWinFormClient,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgissinger_JabberNet-2010\SampleWinFormClient\MainForm.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MainForm_Closing which is more interested in members of the type: JabberClient
Unexploited Encapsulation,SampleWinFormClient,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgissinger_JabberNet-2010\SampleWinFormClient\MainForm.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Version' Time (in method "jc_OnIQ" of class "MainForm").
Insufficient Modularization,SampleWinFormClient,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\sgissinger_JabberNet-2010\SampleWinFormClient\MainForm.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
