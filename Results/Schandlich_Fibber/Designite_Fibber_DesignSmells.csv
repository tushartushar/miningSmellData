Duplicate Abstraction,Fibber,FibberEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Schandlich_Fibber\src\Fibber\FibberEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FibberEngine (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Schandlich_Fibber\src\Fibber\FibberEngine.cs' [106' 158])' FibberEngine (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Schandlich_Fibber\src\Fibber\FibberEngine.cs' [266' 318])
