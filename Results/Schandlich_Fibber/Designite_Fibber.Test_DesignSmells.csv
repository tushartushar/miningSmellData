Unnecessary Abstraction,Fibber.Test,FibberEngineTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Schandlich_Fibber\src\Fibber.Test\FibberEngineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Fibber.Test,FibberEngineTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Schandlich_Fibber\src\Fibber.Test\FibberEngineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
