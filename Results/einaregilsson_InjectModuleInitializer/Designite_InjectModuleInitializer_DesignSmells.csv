Imperative Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Utilities.InjectModuleInitializer,Injector,C:\repos\einaregilsson_InjectModuleInitializer\Injector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Inject
Unnecessary Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Utilities.InjectModuleInitializer.Test,ExecResult,C:\repos\einaregilsson_InjectModuleInitializer\Test\UnitTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Result' StdOut' StdErr
Unnecessary Abstraction,EinarEgilsson.Utilities.InjectModuleInitializer.Test,InjectModuleInitializerTest_2_0,C:\repos\einaregilsson_InjectModuleInitializer\Test\UnitTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MSBuild' RuntimeVersion' TargetFramework' ToolsVersion
