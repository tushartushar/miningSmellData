Unnecessary Abstraction,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,Holder,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\LiteralToParameterExpansion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' md' parameters
Unnecessary Abstraction,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,PrimExpSet,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\LiteralToParameterExpansion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ValueType' Value' Positions
Unnecessary Abstraction,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,OnExtractedCandidateEventArgs,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\MethodsOnASingleClassCloneFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Candidate
Unnecessary Abstraction,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,MethodStartEventArgs,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\MethodsOnASingleClassCloneFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ExpectedMethodsCount' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,MethodProgressEventArgs,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\MethodsOnASingleClassCloneFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,AgentRalph,ICloneFinder,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\ICloneFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AgentRalph,Sets<T>,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\Sets.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetectionTestData,InterceptorsExampleIdeas,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\InterceptorsExampleIdeas.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,Holder,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\LiteralToParameterExpansion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: md' parameters
Deficient Encapsulation,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,PrimExpSet,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\LiteralToParameterExpansion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Value' Positions
Deficient Encapsulation,AgentRalph.CloneCandidateDetection,OnExtractedCandidateEventArgs,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\CloneCandidateDetection\MethodsOnASingleClassCloneFinder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Candidate
Insufficient Modularization,AgentRalph,AstMatchHelper,C:\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\Ralph.Core\AstMatchHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
