Unutilized Abstraction,NRefactory.Debugging,INodeVisualizer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\NRefactory.Debugging\INodeVisualizer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Missing Hierarchy,NRefactoryDemo,AstView,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jbuedel_AgentRalphPlugin\NRefactory.Debugging\AstView.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ElementNode' CollectionNode' CollectionNode (in method "DeleteSelectedNode" of class "AstView").
