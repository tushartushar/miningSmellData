Unnecessary Abstraction,BulkWriter,MappingDestination,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\MappingDestination.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ColumnName' ColumnOrdinal' ColumnSize' DataTypeName' IsKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,BulkWriter,MappingSource,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\MappingSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Property' Ordinal
Unnecessary Abstraction,BulkWriter,PropertyMapping,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\PropertyMapping.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ShouldMap' Source' Destination
Unutilized Abstraction,BulkWriter.Internal,PropertyInfoExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\Internal\PropertyInfoExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulkWriter.Internal,PropertyMappingExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\Internal\PropertyMappingExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BulkWriter.Internal,TypeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\Internal\TypeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,BulkWriter,MappingDestination,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\MappingDestination.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ColumnName' ColumnOrdinal' ColumnSize' DataTypeName' IsKey
Insufficient Modularization,BulkWriter.Internal,EnumerableDataReader<TResult>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\Internal\EnumerableDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,BulkWriter.Internal,EnumerableDataReader<TResult>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\HeadspringLabs_bulk-writer\src\BulkWriter\Internal\EnumerableDataReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetDataTypeName' GetEnumerator' GetFieldType' GetValues' GetBoolean' GetByte' GetChar' GetChars' GetGuid' GetInt16' GetInt32' GetInt64' GetFloat' GetDouble' GetDecimal' GetDateTime' NextResult
