Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrations,IMigrationRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\IMigrationRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrations,MigrationRecord,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\MigrationRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' RunOn
Imperative Abstraction,Raven.Migrations,MigrationRunner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\MigrationRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,Raven.Migrations,MigrationWithAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\MigrationWithAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.

Unutilized Abstraction,Raven.Migrations,ServiceCollectionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Raven.Migrations,IMigrationResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\IMigrationResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Raven.Migrations.IMigrationResolver' Raven.Migrations.MigrationOptions' Raven.Migrations.Migration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Raven.Migrations,MigrationConventions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\MigrationConventions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Raven.Migrations.MigrationConventions' Raven.Migrations.MigrationOptions' Raven.Migrations.Migration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Raven.Migrations,SimpleMigrationResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\SimpleMigrationResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Raven.Migrations.SimpleMigrationResolver' Raven.Migrations.MigrationOptions' Raven.Migrations.Migration
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Raven.Migrations,IMigrationResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\khalidabuhakmeh_RavenMigrations\Raven.Migrations\IMigrationResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
