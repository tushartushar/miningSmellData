Unutilized Abstraction,Pta.Common.DependencyInjection,ServiceConfiguratorExtensions,C:\repos\ptakes_Pta\src\Pta.Common.Topshelf\DependencyInjection\ServiceConfiguratorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf.HostConfigurators,HostConfiguratorExtensions,C:\repos\ptakes_Pta\src\Pta.Common.Topshelf\DependencyInjection\HostConfiguratorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf.HostConfigurators,HostConfiguratorExtenstions,C:\repos\ptakes_Pta\src\Pta.Common.Topshelf\Diagnostics\HostConfiguratorExtenstions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Pta.Common.Diagnostics,LoggerHostLoggerConfigurator,C:\repos\ptakes_Pta\src\Pta.Common.Topshelf\Diagnostics\LoggerHostLoggerConfigurator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: LoggerHostLoggerConfigurator' LoggerLogWriterFactory
Insufficient Modularization,Pta.Common.Diagnostics,LoggerLogWriter,C:\repos\ptakes_Pta\src\Pta.Common.Topshelf\Diagnostics\LoggerLogWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Pta.Common.Diagnostics,LoggerLogWriter,C:\repos\ptakes_Pta\src\Pta.Common.Topshelf\Diagnostics\LoggerLogWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
