Deficient Encapsulation,Tests,OptionBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tejacques_Option\tests\Option.Tests\OptionBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: loops
Deficient Encapsulation,Tests,OptionBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tejacques_Option\tests\Option.Tests\OptionBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: loops
Insufficient Modularization,Tests,OptionBenchmarks,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tejacques_Option\tests\Option.Tests\OptionBenchmarks.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
