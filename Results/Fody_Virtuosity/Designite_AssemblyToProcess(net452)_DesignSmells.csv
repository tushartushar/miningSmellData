Unutilized Abstraction,VirtuosityAbstractClassLDFTNIssue,RegistrationChannel<TChannel>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\CallVirtualizedMethodInClassNestedInGenericClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,VirtuosityAbstractClassLDFTNIssue,AsyncResultBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\CallVirtualizedMethodInClassNestedInGenericClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InnerResult' Channel
Unnecessary Abstraction,EnsureNested,Outer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\EnsureNested.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EnsureNewToOverrideWithInterface,IInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\EnsureNewToOverrideWithInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Property
Unnecessary Abstraction,EnsureNewToOverrideWithInterface,BaseImplementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\EnsureNewToOverrideWithInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Property
Unnecessary Abstraction,EnsureNewToOverrideWithInterface,ChildImplementation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\EnsureNewToOverrideWithInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Property
Unnecessary Abstraction,NewProperty,BaseProperty,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\NewProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' ReplacedValue
Unnecessary Abstraction,NewProperty,DateTimeOffsetProperty,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\NewProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' ReplacedValue
Unnecessary Abstraction,NewProperty,GenericProperty<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\NewProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value' ReplacedValue
Unutilized Abstraction,NewProperty,BasePropertyUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\NewProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,NewProperty,BasePropertyUser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\NewProperty.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Foo which is more interested in members of the type: BaseProperty
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,VirtuosityAbstractClassLDFTNIssue,IChannelBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Fody_Virtuosity\AssemblyToProcess\CallVirtualizedMethodInClassNestedInGenericClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VirtuosityAbstractClassLDFTNIssue.IChannelBase' VirtuosityAbstractClassLDFTNIssue.AsyncResultBase
