Insufficient Modularization,Client,MainWindowViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benrhughes_todotxt.net\Client\MainWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 56 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Client,MainWindowViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benrhughes_todotxt.net\Client\MainWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 96 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Client,MainWindowViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benrhughes_todotxt.net\Client\MainWindowViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 245
Insufficient Modularization,Client,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benrhughes_todotxt.net\Client\Controls\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 88 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Client,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\benrhughes_todotxt.net\Client\Controls\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
