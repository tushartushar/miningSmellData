Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceGraph.Cmdlets,SearchAzureRmGraph,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceGraph\ResourceGraph\Cmdlets\SearchAzureRmGraph.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExecuteCmdlet
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceGraph.Utilities,ErrorResponseExceptionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceGraph\ResourceGraph\Utilities\ErrorResponseExceptionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceGraph.Utilities,JTokenExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceGraph\ResourceGraph\Utilities\JTokenExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceGraph.Utilities,ResourceGraphBaseCmdlet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceGraph\ResourceGraph\Utilities\ResourceGraphBaseCmdlet.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResourceGraphClient' _resourceGraphClient
