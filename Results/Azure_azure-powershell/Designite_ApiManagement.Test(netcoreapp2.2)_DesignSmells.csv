Feature Envy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ApiManagement.Test.ScenarioTests,ApiManagementTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ApiManagement\ApiManagement.Test\ScenarioTests\ApiManagementTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunPowerShellTest which is more interested in members of the type: EnvironmentSetupHelper
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ApiManagement.Test.UnitTests,PsApiManagementTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ApiManagement\ApiManagement.Test\UnitTests\PsApiManagementTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
