Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ContainerInstance,NewAzureContainerGroupCommand,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\ContainerInstance\Commands.ContainerInstance\Commands\NewAzureContainerGroupCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExecuteCmdlet
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ContainerInstance.Models,PSEvent,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\ContainerInstance\Commands.ContainerInstance\Models\PSEvent.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ContainerInstance.Models,PSContainerGroupList,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\ContainerInstance\Commands.ContainerInstance\Models\PSContainerGroupList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ContainerInstance.Models,PSContainerState,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\ContainerInstance\Commands.ContainerInstance\Models\PSContainerState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
