Feature Envy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.DeploymentManager.Test.ScenarioTests,DeploymentManagerController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\DeploymentManager\DeploymentManager.Test\ScenarioTests\DeploymentManagerController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunPowerShellTest which is more interested in members of the type: EnvironmentSetupHelper
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.DeploymentManager.Test.ScenarioTests,DeploymentManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\DeploymentManager\DeploymentManager.Test\ScenarioTests\DeploymentManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.DeploymentManager.Test.ScenarioTests,DeploymentManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\DeploymentManager\DeploymentManager.Test\ScenarioTests\DeploymentManagerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _logger
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.DeploymentManager.Test.ScenarioTests,DeploymentManagerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\DeploymentManager\DeploymentManager.Test\ScenarioTests\DeploymentManagerTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Test.Utilities.Common.RMTestBase
