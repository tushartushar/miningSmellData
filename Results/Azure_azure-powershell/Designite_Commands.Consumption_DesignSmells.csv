Imperative Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Cmdlets.UsageDetails,GetAzureRmConsumptionUsageDetail,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Cmdlets\UsageDetails\GetAzureRmConsumptionUsageDetail.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExecuteCmdlet
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Common,AzureConsumptionCmdletBase,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Common\AzureConsumptionCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ConsumptionManagementClient' _consumptionManagementClient' _defaultRequestHeaders
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Common,Constants,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Common,ParameterSetNames,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SubscriptionItemParameterSet' InvoiceItemParameterSet' BillingPeriodItemParameterSet
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Common,Expands,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MeterDetails' AdditionalProperties
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Common,Formats,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SubscriptionScopeFormat' InvoiceScopeFormat' BillingPeriodScopeFormat' DateTimeParameterFormat
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Models,PSUsageDetail,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Models\PSUsageDetail.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Consumption.Common,AzureConsumptionCmdletBase,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Consumption\Commands.Consumption\Common\AzureConsumptionCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceManager.Common.AzureRMCmdlet
