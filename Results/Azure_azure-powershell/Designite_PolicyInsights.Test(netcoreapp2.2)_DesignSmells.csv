Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.PolicyInsights.Test.ScenarioTests,PolicyEventTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\PolicyEventTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.PolicyInsights.Test.ScenarioTests,PolicyEventTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\PolicyEventTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PolicyEventTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\PolicyEventTests.cs' [1' 21])' PolicyStateSummaryTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\PolicyStateSummaryTests.cs' [1' 21])' PolicyStateTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\PolicyStateTests.cs' [1' 21])' QueryOptionTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\QueryOptionTests.cs' [1' 21])' RemediationTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\RemediationTests.cs' [1' 21])

Feature Envy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.PolicyInsights.Test.ScenarioTests,TestController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\TestController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunPowerShellTest which is more interested in members of the type: EnvironmentSetupHelper
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.PolicyInsights.Test.ScenarioTests,TestController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\PolicyInsights\PolicyInsights.Test\ScenarioTests\TestController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Test.Utilities.Common.RMTestBase
