Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Billing.Common,AzureBillingCmdletBase,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Common\AzureBillingCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BillingManagementClient' _billingManagementClient' _defaultRequestHeaders
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Billing.Common,Constants,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Billing.Common,ParameterSetNames,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Common\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SingleItemParameterSet' LatestItemParameterSet' ListParameterSet' ObjectParameterSet
Unfactored Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Billing.Cmdlets.BillingPeriods,GetAzureRmBillingPeriod,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Cmdlets\BillingPeriods\GetAzureRmBillingPeriod.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  GetAzureRmBillingPeriod (C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Cmdlets\BillingPeriods\GetAzureRmBillingPeriod.cs' [1' 22])' GetAzureRmBillingInvoice (C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Cmdlets\Invoices\GetAzureRmBillingInvoice.cs' [1' 22])
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Billing.Common,AzureBillingCmdletBase,C:\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\ResourceManager\Billing\Commands.Billing\Common\AzureBillingCmdletBase.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceManager.Common.AzureRMCmdlet
