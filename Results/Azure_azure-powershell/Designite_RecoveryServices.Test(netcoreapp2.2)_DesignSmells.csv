(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.RecoveryServices.Test.ScenarioTests,TestController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\RecoveryServices\RecoveryServices.Test\ScenarioTests\TestsBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunPsTestWorkflow which is more interested in members of the type: EnvironmentSetupHelper
Deficient Encapsulation,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.RecoveryServices.Test.ScenarioTests,RecoveryServicesTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\RecoveryServices\RecoveryServices.Test\ScenarioTests\RecoveryServicesTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _logger
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.RecoveryServices.Test.ScenarioTests,RecoveryServicesTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\RecoveryServices\RecoveryServices.Test\ScenarioTests\RecoveryServicesTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Test.Utilities.Common.RMTestBase
