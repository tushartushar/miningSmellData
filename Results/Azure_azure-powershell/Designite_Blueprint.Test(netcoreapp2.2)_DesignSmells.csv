Feature Envy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Blueprint.Test.ScenarioTests,TestController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\Blueprint\Blueprint.Test\ScenarioTests\TestController.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunPsTestWorkflow which is more interested in members of the type: EnvironmentSetupHelper
Broken Hierarchy,Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Blueprint.Test.ScenarioTests,TestController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Azure_azure-powershell\src\Blueprint\Blueprint.Test\ScenarioTests\TestController.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Test.Utilities.Common.RMTestBase
