Unnecessary Abstraction,Dex.Utilities,RsaKeyPair,C:\repos\danielrmz_localtunnel-net-client\packages\Dex.Utilities\Crypto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PrivateKeyAsPEM' PublicKeyAsPEM' PublicSSHKey
Deficient Encapsulation,Dex.Utilities,RsaKeyPair,C:\repos\danielrmz_localtunnel-net-client\packages\Dex.Utilities\Crypto.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: PrivateKeyAsPEM' PublicKeyAsPEM' PublicSSHKey
Insufficient Modularization,Tamir.SharpSsh.jsch,Buffer,C:\repos\danielrmz_localtunnel-net-client\packages\Dex.Utilities\Buffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 27 public methods
