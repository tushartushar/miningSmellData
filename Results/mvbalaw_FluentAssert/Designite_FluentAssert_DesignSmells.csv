Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,FluentAssert,TestStepExecutor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestRunner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TestStepExecutor (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestRunner.cs' [1' 22])' TestVerifyClause (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestVerifyClause.cs' [1' 22])
Duplicate Abstraction,FluentAssert,TestShouldClause<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestShouldClause.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TestShouldClause<T> (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestShouldClause.cs' [1' 20])' TestShouldStaticClause (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestShouldStaticClause.cs' [1' 20])
Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentAssert,ITestStep,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestStep.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Action' Description' FailureSuffix' SuccessSuffix
Feature Envy,FluentAssert,TestVerifyClause,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\TestVerifyClause.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Verify which is more interested in members of the type: ExceptionConfiguration
Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentAssert,ActionContainerSource<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\ActionContainerSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GetActionContainer
Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentAssert,ActionContainerSource<T;TContext>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\ActionContainerSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: GetActionContainer
Unutilized Abstraction,FluentAssert,Test,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,FluentAssert,AssertExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\AssertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 63 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentAssert,AssertExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\AssertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 65 methods
Insufficient Modularization,FluentAssert,AssertExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\AssertExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
Wide Hierarchy,FluentAssert.Exceptions,AssertionException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mvbalaw_FluentAssert\src\FluentAssert\Exceptions\AssertionException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeEqualAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeFalseAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeGreaterThanAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeGreaterThanOrEqualToAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeLessThanAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeLessThanOrEqualToAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeNullAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldBeTrueAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldNotBeEqualAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldNotBeNullAssertionException' FluentAssert.Exceptions.ShouldThrowExceptionAssertionException
