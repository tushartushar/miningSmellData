Unutilized Abstraction,Docker.DotNet.Tests,ISwarmOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahmetalpbalkan_Docker.DotNet\test\Docker.DotNet.Tests\ISwarmOperationsTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Feature Envy,Docker.DotNet.Tests,ISystemOperationsTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ahmetalpbalkan_Docker.DotNet\test\Docker.DotNet.Tests\ISystemOperations.Tests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MonitorEventsAsync_Succeeds which is more interested in members of the type: DockerClient
