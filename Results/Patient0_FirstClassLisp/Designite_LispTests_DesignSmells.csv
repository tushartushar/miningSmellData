Unutilized Abstraction,LispTests.Lexing,ScannerTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Patient0_FirstClassLisp\Lisp\LispTests\Parsing\Lexing\ScannerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,LispTests.Lexing,ScannerTest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Patient0_FirstClassLisp\Lisp\LispTests\Parsing\Lexing\ScannerTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
