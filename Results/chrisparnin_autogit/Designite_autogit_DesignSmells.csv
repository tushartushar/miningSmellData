Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,GuidList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidautogitPkgString' guidautogitCmdSetString' guidautogitCmdSet
Unnecessary Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,PkgCmdIDList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\PkgCmdID.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' autogitOptionsCommand
Unutilized Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,PkgCmdIDList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\PkgCmdID.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,SaveListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SaveListener (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs' [75' 95])' SaveListener (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs' [102' 122])
Feature Envy,ninlabsresearch.autogit,SaveListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: HandleSave which is more interested in members of the type: GitProviderLibGit2Sharp
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ninlabsresearch.autogit,autogitPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\autogitPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ninlabsresearch.autogit.autogitPackage' ninlabsresearch.autogit.SaveListener
