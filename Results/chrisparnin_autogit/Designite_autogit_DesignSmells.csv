Unnecessary Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,GuidList,C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidautogitPkgString' guidautogitCmdSetString' guidautogitCmdSet
Unutilized Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,GuidList,C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,PkgCmdIDList,C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\PkgCmdID.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' autogitOptionsCommand

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ninlabsresearch.autogit,SaveListener,C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SaveListener (C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs' [75' 95])' SaveListener (C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\SaveListener.cs' [102' 122])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ninlabsresearch.autogit,autogitPackage,C:\repos\chrisparnin_autogit\Visual Studio\autogit\autogitPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ninlabsresearch.autogit.autogitPackage' ninlabsresearch.autogit.SaveListener
