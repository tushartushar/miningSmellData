Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AsyncObservableExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\AsyncRx.NET\System.Reactive.Async.Core\System\AsyncObservableExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reactive,AsyncObservable<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\AsyncRx.NET\System.Reactive.Async.Core\System\Reactive\AsyncObservable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,System.Reactive,AsyncObservableBase<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\AsyncRx.NET\System.Reactive.Async.Core\System\Reactive\AsyncObservableBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SubscribeAsync
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reactive.Subjects,AsyncSubject,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\AsyncRx.NET\System.Reactive.Async.Core\System\Reactive\Subjects\AsyncSubject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Reactive,AsyncObserver<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\AsyncRx.NET\System.Reactive.Async.Core\System\Reactive\AsyncObserver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnCompletedAsyncCore' OnErrorAsyncCore' OnNextAsyncCore
