Unnecessary Abstraction,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapChannel,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Excercise9.DictionarySuggestService,DictServiceSoapClient,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\Samples\HOL\CS\Excercise9\Step01\Service References\DictionarySuggestService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 50 public methods
