Unutilized Abstraction,Tests,AsyncQueryableTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Ix.NET\Source\System.Interactive.Async.Providers.Tests\AsyncQueryableExTests.Generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Insufficient Modularization,Tests,AsyncQueryableTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Ix.NET\Source\System.Interactive.Async.Providers.Tests\AsyncQueryableExTests.Generated.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 71 public methods
