Duplicate Abstraction,HomoIconize,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\tools\HomoIcon\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\tools\HomoIcon\Program.cs' [634' 654])' Program (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\tools\HomoIcon\Program.cs' [770' 790])
Unnecessary Abstraction,HomoIconize,IQbservable,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\tools\HomoIcon\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,HomoIconize,Program,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Reactive-Extensions_Rx.NET\Rx.NET\tools\HomoIcon\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 132
