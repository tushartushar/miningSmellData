Feature Envy,Abc.Zebus.Persistence.Handlers,StartMessageReplayCommandHandler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\Handlers\StartMessageReplayCommandHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Handle which is more interested in members of the type: IMessageReplayerRepository
Unutilized Abstraction,Abc.Zebus.Persistence.Initialization,PersistenceRegistry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\Initialization\PersistenceRegistry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Abc.Zebus.Persistence.Storage,TransportMessageSerializer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\Storage\TransportMessageSerializer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Serialize which is more interested in members of the type: CodedOutputStream
Unutilized Abstraction,Abc.Zebus.Persistence.Util,ExtendDictionary,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\Util\ExtendDictionary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Persistence,IPersistenceConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\IPersistenceConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PersisterBatchSize' PersisterDelay' SafetyPhaseDuration' QueuingTransportStopTimeout' PeerIdsToInvestigate' ReplayBatchSize' ReplayUnackedMessageCountThatReleasesNextBatch
Rebellious Hierarchy,Abc.Zebus.Persistence.Reporter,NoopReporter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\Reporter\NoopReporter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddReplaySpeedReport' AddStorageReport
Rebellious Hierarchy,Abc.Zebus.Persistence.Transport,QueueingTransport,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Persistence\Transport\QueueingTransport.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
