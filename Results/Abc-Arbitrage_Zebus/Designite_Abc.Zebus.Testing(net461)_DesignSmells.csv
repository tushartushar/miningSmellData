Deficient Encapsulation,Abc.Zebus.Testing.Measurements,BenchResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\Measurements\Measure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Elapsed' G0Count' G1Count' G2Count' MaxIterationIndex' Ticks
Insufficient Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Testing,TestBus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\TestBus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Testing,TestBus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\TestBus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Testing.Extensions,NUnitExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\Extensions\NUnitExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 58 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Testing.Extensions,NUnitExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\Extensions\NUnitExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 59 methods
Broken Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Testing.Measurements,BenchResults,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\Measurements\Measure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Elapsed' G0Count' G1Count' G2Count' MaxIterationIndex' Ticks
Broken Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Testing.Measurements,MeasureConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Testing\Measurements\MeasureConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
