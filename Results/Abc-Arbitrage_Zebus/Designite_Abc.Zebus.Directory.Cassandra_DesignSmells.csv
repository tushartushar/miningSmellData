Unnecessary Abstraction,Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra.Cql,ICassandraConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra\Cql\ICassandraConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Hosts' KeySpace' QueryTimeout' LocalDataCenter
Feature Envy,Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra.Storage,CqlPeerRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra\Storage\CqlPeerRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Get which is more interested in members of the type: DirectoryDataContext
