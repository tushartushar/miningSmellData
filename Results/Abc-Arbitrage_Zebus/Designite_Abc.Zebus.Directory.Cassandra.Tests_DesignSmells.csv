Unnecessary Abstraction,Abc.Zebus.Directory.Tests,FakeCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra.Tests\FakeCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:

Insufficient Modularization,Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra.Tests.Storage,CqlPeerRepositoryTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Abc-Arbitrage_Zebus\src\Abc.Zebus.Directory.Cassandra.Tests\Storage\CqlPeerRepositoryTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
