Duplicate Abstraction,EESpeak,About,C:\repos\zarthcode_EESpeak\EESpeak\EESpeak\About.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: About[1' 31]' Program[1' 31]
Duplicate Abstraction,EESpeak,About,C:\repos\zarthcode_EESpeak\EESpeak\EESpeak\About.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: About[11' 31]' MainForm[13' 33]' Program[11' 31]
Multifaceted Abstraction,EESpeak,MainForm,C:\repos\zarthcode_EESpeak\EESpeak\EESpeak\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.91
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Windows.Forms,MenuStripEx,C:\repos\zarthcode_EESpeak\EESpeak\EESpeak\MenuStripEx.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,EESpeak.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\zarthcode_EESpeak\EESpeak\EESpeak\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Insufficient Modularization,EESpeak,UnitConverter,C:\repos\zarthcode_EESpeak\EESpeak\EESpeak\UnitConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 104
