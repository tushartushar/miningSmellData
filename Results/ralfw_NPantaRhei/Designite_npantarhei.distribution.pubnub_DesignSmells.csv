Duplicate Abstraction,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,Pubnub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Pubnub (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs' [2526' 2546])' Pubnub (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs' [2561' 2581])
Unutilized Abstraction,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.tests,test_Integration,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\tests\test_Integration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.tests,test_PubnubHostTransceiver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\tests\test_PubnubHostTransceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.tests,test_PubnubStandInTransceiver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\tests\test_PubnubStandInTransceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.tests,explore_PubNub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\tests\explore_PubNub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,ReconnectState<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: channel' type' callback' connectCallback' timetoken
Deficient Encapsulation,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,RequestState,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: request' response' type' channel
Deficient Encapsulation,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,InternetState,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: callback' ipaddr
Deficient Encapsulation,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,PubnubWebRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ServicePoint
Insufficient Modularization,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,Pubnub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,Pubnub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 77 methods
Insufficient Modularization,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,Pubnub,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 235
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api.MD5CryptoServiceProvider' npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api.MD5
Broken Hierarchy,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,MD5CryptoServiceProvider,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api.MD5
Cyclic Hierarchy,npantarhei.distribution.pubnub.api,MD5,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ralfw_NPantaRhei\source\npantarhei.distribution\npantarhei.distribution.pubnub\api\Pubnub.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MD5CryptoServiceProvider
