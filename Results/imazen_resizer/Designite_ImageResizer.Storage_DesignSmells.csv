Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,Computation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\Computation.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetBuildDate which is more interested in members of the type: ILicenseClock
Feature Envy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,LicenseChain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseChain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetReportPairs which is more interested in members of the type: LicenseManagerSingleton

Unnecessary Abstraction,ImageResizer.Storage,IBlobMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\ImageResizer.Storage\BlobProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exists' LastModifiedDateUtc
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImageResizer.Storage,BlobMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\ImageResizer.Storage\BlobProviderBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Exists' LastModifiedDateUtc
Broken Modularization,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,FetchResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseFetcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HttpCode' ShortUrl' FullUrl' FetchError' ParsingError' LikelyNetworkFailure' FailureKind
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageResizer.Storage,Blob,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\ImageResizer.Storage\Blob.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ImageResizer.Storage.Blob' ImageResizer.Storage.BlobProviderBase
Rebellious Hierarchy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,Computation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\Computation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ProvideDiagnosticsHeader' ProvideDiagnostics' ProvidePublicText
Rebellious Hierarchy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,LicenseChain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseChain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: FetchedLicense
Rebellious Hierarchy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,LicenseEnforcer<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseEnforcerPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetIssues' GetDiagnosticsProvider
Rebellious Hierarchy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,LicenseManagerSingleton,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetSharedLicenses' GetAllLicenses
Rebellious Hierarchy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,LicenseBlob,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseParsing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
