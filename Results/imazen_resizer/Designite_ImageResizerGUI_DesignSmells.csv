Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,BatchBackgroundWorking,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\BatchBackgroundWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BatchBackgroundWorking[41' 70]' ZipBackgroundWorking[50' 79]
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,ContexMenuTools,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\Tools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI,ResizeMode,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\ResizeMode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI,AdvancedOptions,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\AdvancedOptions.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetData
Unnecessary Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI,App,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\App.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unexploited Encapsulation,ImageResizerGUI.Code,BatchBackgroundWorking,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\BatchBackgroundWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ImageMissingException' ImageCorruptedException (in method "bwResizeBatch_DoWork" of class "BatchBackgroundWorking").
Insufficient Modularization,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 132
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,F:\newReposMay17\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainWindow' AdvancedOptions
