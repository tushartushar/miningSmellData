Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,BatchBackgroundWorking,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\BatchBackgroundWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,BatchBackgroundWorking,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\BatchBackgroundWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  BatchBackgroundWorking (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\BatchBackgroundWorking.cs' [41' 70])' ZipBackgroundWorking (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\ZipBackgroundWorking.cs' [50' 79])
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,ZipBackgroundWorking,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\ZipBackgroundWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,FileTools,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\Tools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI.Code,ContexMenuTools,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\Tools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MainWindow_AfterSettingChangedOnMainWindows which is more interested in members of the type: AdvancedOptions
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizerGUI,AdvancedOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\AdvancedOptions.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,ImageResizerGUI.Code,BatchBackgroundWorking,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\Code\BatchBackgroundWorking.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ImageMissingException' ImageCorruptedException (in method "bwResizeBatch_DoWork" of class "BatchBackgroundWorking").
Deficient Encapsulation,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: tbox_height' tbox_width
Insufficient Modularization,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ImageResizerGUI,MainWindow,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Samples\ImageResizerGUI\MainWindow_BackgroundWorkers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 122
