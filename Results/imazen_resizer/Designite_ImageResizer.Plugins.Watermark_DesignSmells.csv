Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,Computation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\Computation.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetBuildDate which is more interested in members of the type: ILicenseClock
Feature Envy,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,LicenseChain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseChain.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetReportPairs which is more interested in members of the type: LicenseManagerSingleton
Unutilized Abstraction,ImageResizer.Plugins.LicenseVerifier,StringIntParseExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\LicenseVerifier\LicenseParsing.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
