Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Bench,ExtensionMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Tests\Benchmarking\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Bench,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Tests\Benchmarking\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: imageDir' ConsoleWidth' parallelThreads
Deficient Encapsulation,Bench,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Tests\Benchmarking\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: imageDir' ConsoleWidth' parallelThreads
Insufficient Modularization,Bench,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\imazen_resizer\Tests\Benchmarking\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
