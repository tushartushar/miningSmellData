Unutilized Abstraction,Imazen.Profiling,ConcurrencyResultExtensions,C:\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\Imazen.Profiling\ConcurrencyResultExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Imazen.Profiling,IConcurrencyResults,C:\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\Imazen.Profiling\IConcurrencyResults.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SegmentName' SequentialRuns' ParallelRuns' ParallelThreads
Unutilized Abstraction,Imazen.Profiling,InstrumentedMemoryStream,C:\repos\imazen_resizer\Plugins\Imazen.Profiling\InstrumentedMemoryStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
