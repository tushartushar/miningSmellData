Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder,DenormalizerRebuilder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder\DenormalizerRebuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder,DenormalizerHash,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder\DenormalizersHashes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Hash' Timestamp
Unnecessary Abstraction,Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder,IDenormalizerCatalog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder\IDenormalizerCatalog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Denormalizers
Deficient Encapsulation,Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder,DenormalizersHashes,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Sample.QueryModel.Rebuilder\DenormalizersHashes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Id
