Unnecessary Abstraction,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Commanding,ICommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Commanding\ICommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unnecessary Abstraction,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Commanding,CommandBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Commanding\ICommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id
Unutilized Abstraction,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Commanding,ICommandRouter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Commanding\ICommandRouter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Commanding,ICommandQueue,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Commanding\ICommandQueue.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Support,ExtendedLogInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Support\ExtendedLogInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Insufficient Modularization,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Support,NullLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Support\NullDebugLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Wide Hierarchy,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Commanding,ICommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Commanding\ICommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Commanding.CommandBase' Sample.Commands.Ecommerce.CreateEcommerceItemCommand' Sample.Commands.Inventory.UpdateInventoryItemDescriptionCommand' Sample.Commands.System.AskForReplayCommand' Sample.Commands.System.AskForSpecificHandlerReplayCommand' Sample.Commands.System.PoisoningCommand' Sample.Commands.Purchases.RegisterBillOfLadingCommand' Sample.Saga.DemoCommand1' Sample.Saga.DemoCommand2' Sample.Saga.SagaCommand' Sample.Tests.InProcessBusTests.TestCommand' Sample.Tests.Server.Support.TestCommand' Sample.Tests.Server.Support.TestCommand1' Sample.Tests.Server.Support.TestCommand2
Rebellious Hierarchy,Proximo.Cqrs.Core.Support,NullLogger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andreabalducci_Prxm.Cqrs\Proximo.Cqrs.Core\Support\NullDebugLogger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Debug' Debug' Error' Error' Fatal' Fatal' Info' Info' Warn' Warn' SetInThreadContext' RemoveFromThreadContext' SetOpType' RemoveOpType' Debug' Error' Fatal' Info' Warn
