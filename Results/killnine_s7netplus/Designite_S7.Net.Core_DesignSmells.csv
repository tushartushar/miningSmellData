Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,S7.Net,Plc,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\PLC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,S7.Net,Plc,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\PLC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Plc (C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\PLC.cs' [1095' 1116])' Plc (C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\PLC.cs' [1145' 1166])
Unutilized Abstraction,S7.Net.Types,Boolean,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Boolean.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,S7.Net.Types,Class,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Class.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Class (C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Class.cs' [33' 62])' Struct (C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Struct.cs' [26' 55])
Duplicate Abstraction,S7.Net.Types,Counter,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Counter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Counter (C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Counter.cs' [26' 77])' Word (C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Word.cs' [26' 77])
Unutilized Abstraction,S7.Net.Types,DataItem,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\DataItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,S7.Net,Conversion,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Conversion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: S7.Net.Conversion' S7.Net.Types.Double
Insufficient Modularization,S7.Net,Plc,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\PLC.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,S7.Net.Types,Double,C:\repos\killnine_s7netplus\S7.Net\Types\Double.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: S7.Net.Types.Double' S7.Net.Conversion
