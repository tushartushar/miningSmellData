Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Test1.Client,MyActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\steforster_Remact.Net\test\ConsoleTestApps\src\Test1.Client.Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: OnStartup
Feature Envy,Test1.Client,MyActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\steforster_Remact.Net\test\ConsoleTestApps\src\Test1.Client.Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnMessageFromInputPort which is more interested in members of the type: RemactPortProxy
Deficient Encapsulation,Test1.Client,MyActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\steforster_Remact.Net\test\ConsoleTestApps\src\Test1.Client.Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: m_testInput' m_testOutput
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Test1.Client,MyActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\steforster_Remact.Net\test\ConsoleTestApps\src\Test1.Client.Actor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Test1.Client.MyActor' Test1.Client.Test1Client
