Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,CardinalSplineDemo,CardinalSplineForm,C:\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ContourSamples\CardinalSplineDemo\CardinalSplineForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,CardinalSplineDemo,CardinalSplineForm,C:\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ContourSamples\CardinalSplineDemo\CardinalSplineForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  CardinalSplineForm (C:\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ContourSamples\CardinalSplineDemo\CardinalSplineForm.cs' [1' 23])' Program (C:\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ContourSamples\CardinalSplineDemo\Program.cs' [1' 23])
Duplicate Abstraction,CardinalSplineDemo,Resources,C:\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ContourSamples\CardinalSplineDemo\Resources.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: CardinalSplineDemo.Resources' CardinalSplineDemo.Properties.Resources
Unnecessary Abstraction,CardinalSplineDemo.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ContourSamples\CardinalSplineDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
