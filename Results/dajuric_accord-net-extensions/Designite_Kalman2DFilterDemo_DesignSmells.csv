Duplicate Abstraction,Kalman2DFilterDemo,ConstantVelocityProcess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\ConstantVelocityProcess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConstantVelocityProcess (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\ConstantVelocityProcess.cs' [1' 23])' Kalman2dDemo (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\Kalman2dDemo.cs' [1' 23])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\Program.cs' [1' 23])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Kalman2DFilterDemo.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Kalman2DFilterDemo,ConstantVelocityProcess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\ConstantVelocityProcess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WorkingArea' TimeInterval
Deficient Encapsulation,Kalman2DFilterDemo,ConstantVelocityProcess,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\KalmanSamples\Kalman2DFilterDemo\ConstantVelocityProcess.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: WorkingArea' TimeInterval
