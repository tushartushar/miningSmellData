Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Ambiguous Interface,Math,Accord.Extensions.Math,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single' general entry-point via the following class: ComplexF
Feature Concentration,Math,Accord.Extensions.Math,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BranchAndBoundAssigmentExtensions]' [Complex]' [MatrixExtensions]' [FourierTransform' ComplexF]' [MathExtensions]' [MathPowerofTwoExtensions]' [MathEnumerableExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.88
