Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleParticleFilterDemo,SimpleParticleDemoForm,F:\newReposMay17\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ParticleFilterSamples\ColorParticleFilterDemo\ColorParticleDemo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,SimpleParticleFilterDemo,SimpleParticleDemoForm,F:\newReposMay17\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ParticleFilterSamples\ColorParticleFilterDemo\ColorParticleDemo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SimpleParticleDemoForm[1' 22]' Program[1' 22]
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleParticleFilterDemo.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\dajuric_accord-net-extensions\Samples\Math\ParticleFilterSamples\ColorParticleFilterDemo\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
