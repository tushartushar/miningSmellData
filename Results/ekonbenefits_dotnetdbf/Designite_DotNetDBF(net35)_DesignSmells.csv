Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetDBF,DBFBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CharEncoding' BlockSize' NullSymbol' _nullSymbol
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetDBF,DBFSigniture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NotSet' WithMemo' DBase3' DBase3WithMemo
Unutilized Abstraction,DotNetDBF,DBFSigniture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DotNetDBF,DBFSignature,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFHeader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' NotSet' WithMemo' DBase3' DBase3WithMemo

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DotNetDBF,DBFWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DBFWriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFWriter.cs' [52' 72])' DBFWriter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFWriter.cs' [88' 108])
Deficient Encapsulation,DotNetDBF,DBFField,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFField.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dataType' decimalCount' fieldLength' fieldName' indexFieldFlag' nameNullIndex' reserv1' reserv2' reserv3' reserv4' setFieldsFlag' workAreaId
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DotNetDBF,DBFReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DotNetDBF.DBFReader' DotNetDBF.MemoValue
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DotNetDBF,DBFWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DotNetDBF.DBFWriter' DotNetDBF.MemoValue
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DotNetDBF,DBFWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ekonbenefits_dotnetdbf\DotNetDBF\DBFWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DotNetDBF.DBFWriter' DotNetDBF.MemoValue' DotNetDBF.Utils
