Unnecessary Abstraction,LoreSoft.MathExpressions,IExpression,C:\repos\loresoft_Calculator\Source\LoreSoft.MathExpressions\IExpression.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ArgumentCount' Evaluate
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,LoreSoft.MathExpressions,MathEvaluator,C:\repos\loresoft_Calculator\Source\LoreSoft.MathExpressions\MathEvaluator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MathEvaluator' VariableDictionary
