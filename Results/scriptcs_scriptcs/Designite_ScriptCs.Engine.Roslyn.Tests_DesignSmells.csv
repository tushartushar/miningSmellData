Insufficient Modularization,ScriptCs.Tests,TheExecuteMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\test\ScriptCs.Engine.Roslyn.Tests\CSharpReplEngineTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
