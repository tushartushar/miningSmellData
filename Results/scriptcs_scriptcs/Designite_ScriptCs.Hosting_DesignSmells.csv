Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,ModuleLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\ModuleLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Load
Imperative Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,RuntimeServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\RuntimeServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetScriptServices
Unnecessary Abstraction,ScriptCs,ValidatedNotNullAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Core\Guard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AutoCompleteEvent
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,Completion,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result' Prefix
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,Handler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CKI' KeyHandler
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 129
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ScriptCs.Hosting,InitializationServices,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\InitializationServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ScriptCs.Hosting.InitializationServices' ScriptCs.Hosting.ScriptServicesBuilder
Rebellious Hierarchy,ScriptCs.Hosting,ColoredConsoleLogProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\ColoredConsoleLogProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OpenNestedContext' OpenMappedContext
Rebellious Hierarchy,ScriptCs.Hosting,TypeResolver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\TypeResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResolveType
