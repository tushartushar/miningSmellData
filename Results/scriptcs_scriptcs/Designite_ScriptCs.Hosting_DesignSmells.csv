Unnecessary Abstraction,ScriptCs,ValidatedNotNullAttribute,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Core\Guard.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,ITypeResolver,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\ITypeResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,ModuleLoader,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\ModuleLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Load
Imperative Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,RuntimeServices,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\RuntimeServices.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetScriptServices
Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,ServiceOverrides<TConfig>,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\ServiceOverrides.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting,TypeResolver,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\TypeResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting.Package,NugetMachineWideSettings,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\Package\NugetMachineWideSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ScriptCs.Hosting.Package,ScriptCsPackageManager,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\Package\ScriptCsPackageManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AutoCompleteEvent
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,Completion,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Result' Prefix
Deficient Encapsulation,Mono.Terminal,Handler,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CKI' KeyHandler
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 46 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Mono.Terminal,LineEditor,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\LineEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
Rebellious Hierarchy,ScriptCs.Hosting,ColoredConsoleLogProvider,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\ColoredConsoleLogProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OpenNestedContext' OpenMappedContext
Rebellious Hierarchy,ScriptCs.Hosting,TypeResolver,C:\repos\scriptcs_scriptcs\src\ScriptCs.Hosting\TypeResolver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResolveType
