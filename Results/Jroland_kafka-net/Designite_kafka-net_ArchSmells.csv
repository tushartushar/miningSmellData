Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,kafka-net,KafkaNet.Common,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): KafkaNet
Unstable Dependency,kafka-net,KafkaNet,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): KafkaNet.Statistics
Unstable Dependency,kafka-net,KafkaNet.Model,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): KafkaNet' KafkaNet.Protocol
Unstable Dependency,kafka-net,KafkaNet.Protocol,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): KafkaNet' KafkaNet.Statistics
God Component,kafka-net,KafkaNet.Protocol,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 44
Feature Concentration,kafka-net,KafkaNet.Common,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AsyncLock]' [BigEndianBinaryReader' Crc32Provider' BigEndianBinaryWriter' StringPrefixEncoding' KafkaMessagePacker]' [AsyncManualResetEvent' AsyncCollection]' [ConcurrentCircularBuffer]' [ScheduledTimerStatus' IScheduledTimer' ScheduledTimer]' [Extensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.46

LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.3
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.2  All the dependencies among components: from: KafkaNet.Common' to: KafkaNet' from: KafkaNet.Statistics' to: KafkaNet.Common' from: KafkaNet.Statistics' to: KafkaNet.Model' from: KafkaNet.Statistics' to: KafkaNet' from: KafkaNet' to: KafkaNet.Model' from: KafkaNet' to: KafkaNet.Protocol' from: KafkaNet' to: KafkaNet.Common' from: KafkaNet' to: KafkaNet.Statistics' from: KafkaNet.Model' to: KafkaNet' from: KafkaNet.Model' to: KafkaNet.Protocol' from: KafkaNet.Protocol' to: KafkaNet.Common' from: KafkaNet.Protocol' to: KafkaNet' from: KafkaNet.Protocol' to: KafkaNet.Statistics.
