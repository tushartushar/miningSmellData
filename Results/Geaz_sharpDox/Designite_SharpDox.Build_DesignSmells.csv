Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,SharpDox.Build,SDNavParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\SDNavParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ParseNavFile
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDox.Build,BuildController,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\BuildController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SharpDox.Build,SDTargetFxParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\SDTargetFxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetTargetFx
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpDox.Build,SDTargetFxParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\SDTargetFxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SharpDox.Build.Context.Step,ExportStep,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\Context\Step\ExportStep.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: RunAllExporters which is more interested in members of the type: StepInput
Feature Envy,SharpDox.Build.Context.Step,ParseProjectStep,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\Context\Step\ParseProjectStep.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SetProjectInfos which is more interested in members of the type: SDProject
Broken Modularization,SharpDox.Build,SDBuildStrings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Geaz_sharpDox\src\Libraries\SharpDox.Build\SDBuildStrings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartingBuild' BuildSuccess' StartingStep' StepCheckConfig' StepParseProject' StepParseCode' StepExport' StepEnd' ParsingProject' ParseTokens' ParsingDescriptions' ParsingNav' NoDocLanguage' NoProjectNameGiven' NoProjectGiven' ProjectNotFound' NoOutputPathGiven' OutputPathNotFound' BuildStopped' CouldNotEndBuild' RequirementError' RunningExporter' DisplayName
