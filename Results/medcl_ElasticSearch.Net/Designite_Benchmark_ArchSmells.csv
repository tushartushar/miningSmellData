Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.08  All the dependencies among components: from: BenchmarkTests' to: ElasticSearch.Client' from: BenchmarkTests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' from: BenchmarkTests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' to: Thrift.Transport' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Admin' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.QueryString' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Mapping' from: ElasticSearch.Client' to: ElasticSearch.Client.QueryDSL' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Mapping' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Exception' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Connection' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Connection' to: Thrift.Protocol' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Connection' to: Thrift.Transport' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Connection' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Connection' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Connection' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Thrift' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Http' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Http' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Http' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Http' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Http' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Exception' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' to: Thrift.Protocol' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' to: Thrift.Transport' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' to: Thrift' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Thrift' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Thrift' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Thrift' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.IDL' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Transport.Thrift' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Exception' from: Thrift.Protocol' to: Thrift.Transport' from: Thrift.Server' to: Thrift.Protocol' from: Thrift.Server' to: Thrift.Transport' from: Thrift.Server' to: Thrift' from: Thrift' to: Thrift.Protocol' from: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' from: ElasticSearch.DataManager.Dialogs' to: ElasticSearch.Client' from: ElasticSearch.DataManager.Dialogs' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.DataManager.Dialogs' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Admin' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Mapping' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: ElasticSearchDataManager' to: ElasticSearch.Client.QueryDSL' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Domain' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Utils' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Config' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.QueryString' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.Mapping' from: Tests' to: ElasticSearch.Client.QueryDSL.,ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient' ElasticSearch.Client.ElasticSearchClient
