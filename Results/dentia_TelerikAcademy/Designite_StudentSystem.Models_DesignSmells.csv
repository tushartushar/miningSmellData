Unnecessary Abstraction,StudentSystem.Models,StudentInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dentia_TelerikAcademy\Homeworks\WEB-SERVICES\ASP.NET-Web-API\StudentSystem\StudentSystem.Models\StudentInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Email' Address
Unutilized Abstraction,StudentSystem.Models,Test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dentia_TelerikAcademy\Homeworks\WEB-SERVICES\ASP.NET-Web-API\StudentSystem\StudentSystem.Models\Test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,StudentSystem.Models,Homework,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dentia_TelerikAcademy\Homeworks\WEB-SERVICES\ASP.NET-Web-API\StudentSystem\StudentSystem.Models\Homework.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
