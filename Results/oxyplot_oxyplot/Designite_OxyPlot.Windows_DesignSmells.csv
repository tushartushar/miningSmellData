Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,OxyColorConverter,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Converters\OxyColorConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,ThicknessConverter,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Converters\ThicknessConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,PlotView,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\PlotView.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,RenderContext,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\RenderContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  RenderContext (C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\RenderContext.cs' [121' 143])' RenderContext (C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\RenderContext.cs' [371' 393])
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,TrackerControl,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Tracker\TrackerControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,TrackerDefinition,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Tracker\TrackerDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TrackerKey' TrackerTemplate' TrackerKeyProperty' TrackerTemplateProperty
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,TrackerDefinition,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Tracker\TrackerDefinition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,OxyPlot.Windows,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,OxyPlot.Windows,ConverterExtensions,C:\repos\oxyplot_oxyplot\Source\OxyPlot.Windows\Utilities\ConverterExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
