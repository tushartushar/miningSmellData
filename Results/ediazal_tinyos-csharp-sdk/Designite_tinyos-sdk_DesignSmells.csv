Duplicate Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,SerialPacket,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\Framer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SerialPacket[1' 34]' Message[1' 34]' SerialMessage[1' 34]' EventArgMessage[1' 34]' EventArgSerialMessage[1' 34]' SerialSource[1' 34]' SFSource[1' 34]' SourceMaker[1' 34]
Duplicate Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,SerialPacket,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\Framer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SerialPacket[1' 36]' EventArgMessage[1' 36]' EventArgSerialMessage[1' 36]' SerialSource[1' 36]' SFSource[1' 36]' SourceMaker[1' 36]
Duplicate Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,Message,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\Message.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Message[1' 41]' SerialMessage[1' 41]
Duplicate Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,EventArgMessage,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\MessageSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: EventArgMessage[1' 40]' EventArgSerialMessage[1' 40]
Unnecessary Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,EventArgSerialMessage,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\MoteIF.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: msg
Multifaceted Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,SerialMessage,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\SerialMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.82
Multifaceted Abstraction,tinyos.sdk,SerialSource,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\SerialSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.85
Deficient Encapsulation,tinyos.sdk,Escaper,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\Framer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: escaped' escapePtr' crc
Deficient Encapsulation,tinyos.sdk,SerialSource,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\SerialSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAX_RETRIES_NO_ACK' ACK_RECEIVED' NO_FRAMER_SET
Deficient Encapsulation,tinyos.sdk,SerialSource,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\SerialSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MAX_RETRIES_NO_ACK' ACK_RECEIVED' NO_FRAMER_SET
Unfactored Hierarchy,tinyos.sdk,SerialSource,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\tinyos-sdk\SerialSource.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: SerialSource[1' 37]' SFSource[1' 37]
