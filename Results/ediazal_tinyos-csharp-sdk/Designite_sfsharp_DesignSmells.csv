Multifaceted Abstraction,sfsharp,Prompt,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\Prompt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.9
Multifaceted Abstraction,sfsharp,SerialForwarder,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SerialForwarder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.83
Duplicate Abstraction,sfsharp,SerialForwarder,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SerialForwarder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SerialForwarder[1' 40]' SFMain[1' 40]
Multifaceted Abstraction,sfsharp,SFMain,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SFMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Deficient Encapsulation,sfsharp,Listener,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\Listener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: active
Deficient Encapsulation,sfsharp,Prompt,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\Prompt.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: prompt' prefix' welcome' helpTextColor' errorTextColor' successTextColor' eventTextColor' controlClientCommandColor' prefixColor
Deficient Encapsulation,sfsharp,SerialForwarder,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SerialForwarder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: port' id' running
Deficient Encapsulation,sfsharp,ClientClosedEvtArg,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SFClientHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: msg
Deficient Encapsulation,sfsharp,MoteIFClosedEvtArg,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SFClientHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: msg
Insufficient Modularization,sfsharp,SFMain,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SFMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 150
Broken Hierarchy,sfsharp,SFClientHandler,C:\repos\ediazal_tinyos-csharp-sdk\sfsharp\SFClientHandler.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SFSource
