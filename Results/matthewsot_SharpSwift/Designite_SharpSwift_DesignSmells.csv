Deficient Encapsulation,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,C:\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Model
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,C:\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Model
Insufficient Modularization,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,C:\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 51 public methods
