Unutilized Abstraction,SharpSwift,test,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\test.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Model
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Model
Insufficient Modularization,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 51 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 57 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpSwift.Converters,ConvertToSwift,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\matthewsot_SharpSwift\SharpSwift\SharpSwift\Converters\ArgumentSyntaxParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 103
