Unnecessary Abstraction,XR.Mono.Cover,BreakPoint,C:\repos\inorton_XR.Baboon\XR.Mono.Cover\CoverHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Request' Location' Record
Unnecessary Abstraction,XR.Mono.Cover,NamespaceCodeRecord,C:\repos\inorton_XR.Baboon\XR.Mono.Cover\NamespaceCodeRecord.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Coverage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XR.Mono.Cover,CoverHost,C:\repos\inorton_XR.Baboon\XR.Mono.Cover\CoverHost.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: XR.Mono.Cover.CoverHost' XR.Mono.Cover.CodeRecordData
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,XR.Mono.Cover,CodeRecordData,C:\repos\inorton_XR.Baboon\XR.Mono.Cover\CodeRecordData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: XR.Mono.Cover.CodeRecordData' XR.Mono.Cover.CoverHost
Broken Hierarchy,XR.Mono.Cover,NamespaceCodeRecord,C:\repos\inorton_XR.Baboon\XR.Mono.Cover\NamespaceCodeRecord.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): XR.Mono.Cover.CodeRecord
