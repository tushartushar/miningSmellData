Unutilized Abstraction,FaultTolerance,Listener,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\FaultTolerance\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Missing Hierarchy,FaultTolerance,Counter,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\FaultTolerance\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: UseStorage' Increment (in method "OnReceive" of class "Counter").
