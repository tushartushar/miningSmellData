(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,ClusterShardingInternalsSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,ClusterShardingInternalsSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ClusterShardingInternalsSpec (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs' [25' 45])' GetShardTypeNamesSpec (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\GetShardTypeNamesSpec.cs' [49' 69])
Duplicate Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,ClusterShardingInternalsSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ClusterShardingInternalsSpec (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs' [38' 58])' ProxyShardingSpec (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ProxyShardingSpec.cs' [56' 76])
Feature Envy,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,ClusterShardingInternalsSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ClusterSharding_must_start_a_region_in_proxy_mode_in_case_of_node_role_mismatch which is more interested in members of the type: ClusterSharding
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,ClusterShardingSettingsSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingSettingsSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,CoordinatedShutdownShardingSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\CoordinatedShutdownShardingSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Sharding_and_CoordinatedShutdown_must_run_successfully
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,DDataClusterShardingConfigSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\DDataClusterShardingConfigSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,GetShardTypeNamesSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\GetShardTypeNamesSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,AbstractInactiveEntityPassivationSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\InactiveEntityPassivationSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GetConfig
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,LeastShardAllocationStrategySpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\LeastShardAllocationStrategySpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,ProxyShardingSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ProxyShardingSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,SupervisionSpec,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\SupervisionSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,EmptyHandlerActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\ClusterShardingInternalsSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnReceive
Rebellious Hierarchy,Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests,EntityActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\contrib\cluster\Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Tests\PersistentShardSpec.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
