Unutilized Abstraction,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,BackendActor,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Routing\Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting\BackendActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,FrontendActor,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Routing\Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting\FrontendActor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,FrontendCommand,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Routing\Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Message' JobId' ConsistentHashKey
Unnecessary Abstraction,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,CommandComplete,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Routing\Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Missing Hierarchy,Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting,FrontendActor,C:\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\examples\Cluster\Routing\Samples.Cluster.ConsistentHashRouting\FrontendActor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: StartCommand' CommandComplete (in method "ReadyToProcess" of class "FrontendActor").
