Unnecessary Abstraction,PingPong,Messages,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\benchmark\PingPong\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Missing Hierarchy,PingPong,ClientActorBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\benchmark\PingPong\ClientActorBase.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Msg' Run (in method "Receive" of class "ClientActorBase").
Unfactored Hierarchy,PingPong,ClientAsyncActor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\benchmark\PingPong\ClientAsyncActor.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  ClientAsyncActor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\benchmark\PingPong\ClientAsyncActor.cs' [23' 49])' ClientReceiveActor (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\benchmark\PingPong\ClientReceiveActor.cs' [21' 47])
Missing Hierarchy,PingPong,Destination,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\akkadotnet_akka.net\src\benchmark\PingPong\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Msg' Started (in method "OnReceive" of class "Destination").
