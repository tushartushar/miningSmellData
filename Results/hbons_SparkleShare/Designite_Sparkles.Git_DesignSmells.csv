Unutilized Abstraction,Sparkles.Git,GitRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hbons_SparkleShare\Sparkles\Git\Git.Repository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Sparkles.Git,GitCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hbons_SparkleShare\Sparkles\Git\Git.Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ExecPath
Deficient Encapsulation,Sparkles.Git,GitCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hbons_SparkleShare\Sparkles\Git\Git.Command.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: ExecPath
Insufficient Modularization,Sparkles.Git,GitRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hbons_SparkleShare\Sparkles\Git\Git.Repository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
