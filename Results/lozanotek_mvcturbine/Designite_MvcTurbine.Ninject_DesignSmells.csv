Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,MvcTurbine.Ninject,FirstBindingInfo,C:\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.Ninject\NinjectServiceLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' BindingExists
Insufficient Modularization,MvcTurbine.Ninject,NinjectServiceLocator,C:\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.Ninject\NinjectServiceLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.Ninject,NinjectModuleRegistry,C:\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.Ninject\NinjectModuleRegistry.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MvcTurbine.Web.Modules.HttpModuleRegistry
Rebellious Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.Ninject,NinjectServiceLocator,C:\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.Ninject\NinjectServiceLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: TearDown
Rebellious Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.Ninject,TurbineModule,C:\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.Ninject\TurbineModule.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RegisterAll
