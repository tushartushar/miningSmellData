(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,MvcTurbine.ComponentModel,IServiceRegistrar,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\ComponentModel\IServiceRegistrar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: IServiceRegistrar[13' 73]' IServiceLocator[58' 118]
Unutilized Abstraction,MvcTurbine.ComponentModel,ServiceLocatorExtensions,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\ComponentModel\ServiceLocatorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,MvcTurbine.ComponentModel,ServiceResolutionException,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\ComponentModel\ServiceResolutionException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,MvcTurbine,IRotorContext,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\IRotorContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IRotorContext' ITurbineApplication
Broken Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.ComponentModel,CommonAssemblyFilter,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\ComponentModel\CommonAssemblyFilter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AssemblyFilter
Rebellious Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.ComponentModel,EmptyServiceReleaser,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\ComponentModel\EmptyServiceReleaser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Release
Wide Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.ComponentModel,ISupportAutoRegistration,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\ComponentModel\ISupportAutoRegistration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: HtmlConventionBlade' ControllerBlade' HttpModuleBlade' InferredActionBlade' ModelBinderBlade' FilterBlade' RoutingBlade' ViewBlade' RendererBlade' AreaBlade' ModelMetadataBlade' ModelValidatorBlade' ValueProviderBlade' ServiceBusBlade
Wide Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.Blades,Blade,F:\newReposMay17\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine\Blades\Blade.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large.
