Unutilized Abstraction,MvcTurbine.StructureMap,StructureMapRegistrator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.StructureMap\StructureMapRegistrator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,MvcTurbine.StructureMap,StructureMapServiceLocator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.StructureMap\StructureMapServiceLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,MvcTurbine.StructureMap,StructureMapServiceLocator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lozanotek_mvcturbine\src\Engine\MvcTurbine.StructureMap\StructureMapServiceLocator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
