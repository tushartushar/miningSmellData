Unutilized Abstraction,ResourceLib.UI,CloneMeunToolItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\UI\CloneMeunToolItem.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,ResourceLib.UI,FrmConfirm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\UI\frmConfirm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetMessage
Duplicate Abstraction,ResourceLib.UI,frmPasswordInputBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\UI\frmPasswordInputBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  frmPasswordInputBox (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\UI\frmPasswordInputBox.cs' [18' 62])' FrmInputBox (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\UI\frmInputBox.cs' [18' 62])
Unutilized Abstraction,ResourceLib.UI,MyMessageBox,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\UI\MyMessageBox.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ResourceLib.Method,MainTreeImageType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\Method\GetSystemIcon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ResourceLib.Method,Shfileinfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\Method\GetSystemIcon.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' hIcon' iIcon' dwAttributes' szDisplayName' szTypeName
Deficient Encapsulation,ResourceLib.Method,GuiConfig,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\magicdict_MagicMongoDBTool\ResourceLib\Method\GUIConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
