Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerImportSettings,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SqlServerImportSettings[31' 55]' SqlServerConnectionSettings[51' 75]
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerImportSettings,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SqlServerImportSettings[35' 55]' SqlServerCheckoutSettings[44' 64]' SqlServerUpdateSettings[50' 70]' SqlServerConnectionSettings[55' 75]
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,MsDbscCommandLineArgs,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsDbscCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,MsImportOperation,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerTable,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SqlServerTable' MsDbscDbConnection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerCheckoutSettings,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SqlServerCheckoutSettings' SqlServerUpdateSettings
Broken Hierarchy,dbsc.SqlServer,MsDbscApp,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsDbscApp.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DbscApp
