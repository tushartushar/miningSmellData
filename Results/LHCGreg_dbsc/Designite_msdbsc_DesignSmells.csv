Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerImportSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerImportSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SqlServerImportSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerImportSettings.cs' [31' 55])' SqlServerConnectionSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerConnectionSettings.cs' [51' 75])

List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SqlServerImportSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerImportSettings.cs' [35' 55])' SqlServerCheckoutSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerCheckoutSettings.cs' [44' 64])' SqlServerUpdateSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerUpdateSettings.cs' [50' 70])' SqlServerConnectionSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerConnectionSettings.cs' [55' 75])
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,DefaultSchema,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerImportTableCalculator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DefaultSchemaName
Feature Envy,dbsc.SqlServer,MsDbscCommandLineArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsDbscCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetTargetConnectionSettings which is more interested in members of the type: TargetDBOptionBundle
Feature Envy,dbsc.SqlServer,MsDbscCommandLineArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsDbscCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetImportSettings which is more interested in members of the type: SourceDBOptionBundle
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,TableName,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsDbscDbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TableSchema' Table
Imperative Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,MsImportOperation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,Index,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IndexName' TableSchema' TableName
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,RecoveryModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: RecoveryModelId
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.SqlServer,SourceDbInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\MsImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: snapshot_isolation_state
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerTable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerTable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: dbsc.SqlServer.SqlServerTable' dbsc.SqlServer.MsDbscDbConnection
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.SqlServer,SqlServerCheckoutSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\msdbsc\SqlServerCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: dbsc.SqlServer.SqlServerCheckoutSettings' dbsc.SqlServer.SqlServerUpdateSettings
