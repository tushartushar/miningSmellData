Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,PgCheckoutSettings,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: PgCheckoutSettings[43' 63]' PgImportSettings[35' 55]' PgUpdateSettings[50' 70]
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,PgDbscCommandLineArgs,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,PgImportOperation,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.Postgres,PgCheckoutSettings,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PgCheckoutSettings' PgUpdateSettings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.Postgres,PgDbscDbConnection,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscDbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: PgDbscDbConnection' PgTable
Broken Hierarchy,dbsc.Postgres,PgDbscApp,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscApp.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DbscApp
Unfactored Hierarchy,dbsc.Postgres,PgSourceDBOptionBundle,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgSourceDBOptionBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: PgSourceDBOptionBundle[83' 102]' PgTargetDBOptionBundle[71' 90]
