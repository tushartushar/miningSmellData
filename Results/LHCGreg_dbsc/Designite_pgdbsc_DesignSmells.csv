Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,PgCheckoutSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PgCheckoutSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgCheckoutSettings.cs' [43' 63])' PgImportSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgImportSettings.cs' [35' 55])' PgUpdateSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgUpdateSettings.cs' [50' 70])
Feature Envy,dbsc.Postgres,PgDbscCommandLineArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetTargetConnectionSettings which is more interested in members of the type: PgTargetDBOptionBundle
Feature Envy,dbsc.Postgres,PgDbscCommandLineArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetImportSettings which is more interested in members of the type: PgSourceDBOptionBundle
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,Table,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscDbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: table_schema' table_name
Imperative Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,PgImportOperation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,ConstraintInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: conname' contype' nspname' tablename' def
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.Postgres,IndexInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: index_schema' index_name' def
Broken Modularization,dbsc.Postgres,ConstraintInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgImportOperation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: conname' contype' nspname' tablename' def
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.Postgres,PgCheckoutSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: dbsc.Postgres.PgCheckoutSettings' dbsc.Postgres.PgUpdateSettings
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.Postgres,PgDbscDbConnection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgDbscDbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: dbsc.Postgres.PgDbscDbConnection' dbsc.Postgres.PgTable
Unfactored Hierarchy,dbsc.Postgres,PgSourceDBOptionBundle,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgSourceDBOptionBundle.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  PgSourceDBOptionBundle (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgSourceDBOptionBundle.cs' [83' 102])' PgTargetDBOptionBundle (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\pgdbsc\PgTargetDBOptionBundle.cs' [71' 90])
