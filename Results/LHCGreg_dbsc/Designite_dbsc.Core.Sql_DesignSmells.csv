Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.Core.Sql,ISqlCheckoutSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\ISqlCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CreationTemplate
Unnecessary Abstraction,dbsc.Core.Sql,ISqlUpdateSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\ISqlUpdateSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.Core.Sql,SqlCheckoutSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\SqlCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SqlCheckoutSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\SqlCheckoutSettings.cs' [50' 70])' SqlUpdateSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\SqlUpdateSettings.cs' [51' 71])
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.Core.Sql,SqlCheckoutSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\SqlCheckoutSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: dbsc.Core.Sql.SqlCheckoutSettings' dbsc.Core.Sql.SqlUpdateSettings
Rebellious Hierarchy,dbsc.Core.Sql,BaseDbscDbConnection<TConnection;TTransaction>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\BaseDbscDbConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ExecuteSqlScript
Rebellious Hierarchy,dbsc.Core.Sql,SqlDbscEngine<TConnectionSettings;TCheckoutOptions;TImportSettings;TUpdateSettings;TConnection;TTable>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\dbsc.Core.Sql\SqlDbscEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ImportData' GetTablesToImport
