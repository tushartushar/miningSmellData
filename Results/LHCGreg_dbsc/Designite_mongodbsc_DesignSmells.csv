Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo,MongoCheckoutOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoCheckoutOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  MongoCheckoutOptions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoCheckoutOptions.cs' [49' 69])' MongoImportSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoImportSettings.cs' [35' 55])' MongoUpdateSettings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoUpdateSettings.cs' [50' 70])
Feature Envy,dbsc.Mongo,MongoCommandLineArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetTargetConnectionSettings which is more interested in members of the type: TargetDBOptionBundle
Feature Envy,dbsc.Mongo,MongoCommandLineArgs,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoCommandLineArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: GetImportSettings which is more interested in members of the type: SourceDBOptionBundle
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbsc.Mongo,MongoCheckoutOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc\MongoCheckoutOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: dbsc.Mongo.MongoCheckoutOptions' dbsc.Mongo.MongoUpdateSettings
