Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,BaseTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\BaseTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetDirectories
Multifaceted Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,BaseTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\BaseTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.82
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,BaseTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\BaseTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,BaseTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\BaseTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: BaseTestFixture[103' 125]' BaseTestFixture[127' 149]
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,Book,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\Book.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,CheckoutTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\CheckoutTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,Person,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\Person.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,ShowRevisionTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\ShowRevisionTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,UpdateTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\UpdateTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,CheckoutTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\CheckoutTestFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,CheckoutTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\CheckoutTestFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTestFixture
Broken Hierarchy,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,ShowRevisionTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\ShowRevisionTestFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTestFixture
Broken Hierarchy,dbsc.Mongo.Integration,UpdateTestFixture,F:\newReposMay17\LHCGreg_dbsc\mongodbsc.Integration\UpdateTestFixture.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTestFixture
