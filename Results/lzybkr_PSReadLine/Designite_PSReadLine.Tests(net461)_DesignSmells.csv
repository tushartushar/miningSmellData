Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Feature Envy,Test,ReadLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\BasicEditingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Test which is more interested in members of the type: TestConsole
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,WindowsConsoleFixtureHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\ConsoleFixture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,TestConsole,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\MockConsole.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,MultiLineBufferHelperTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\MultiLineBufferHelperTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,MockedMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test,NextLineToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,NextLineToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test,SelectionToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _text
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,SelectionToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test,KeyPlaceholder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,KeyPlaceholder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Test,ViRegisterTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\ViRegisterTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,CHAR_INFO,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\MockConsole.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: UnicodeChar' Attributes
Deficient Encapsulation,Test,SelectionToken,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _text
Insufficient Modularization,Test,ReadLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\BasicEditingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 177 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Test,ReadLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\BasicEditingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 208 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Test,ReadLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\BasicEditingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 289
Missing Hierarchy,Test,ReadLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\BasicEditingTest.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: NextLineToken' TokenClassification (in method "CreateCharInfoBuffer" of class "ReadLine").
Broken Hierarchy,Test,en_US_Windows,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\lzybkr_PSReadLine\test\UnitTestReadLine.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Test.ReadLine
