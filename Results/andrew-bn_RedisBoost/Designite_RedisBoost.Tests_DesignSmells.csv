Insufficient Modularization,RedisBoost.Tests,IntegrationTestsForGenericMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrew-bn_RedisBoost\tests\RedisBoost.Tests\IntegrationTestsForGenericMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 39 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisBoost.Tests,IntegrationTestsForGenericMethods,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrew-bn_RedisBoost\tests\RedisBoost.Tests\IntegrationTestsForGenericMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Insufficient Modularization,RedisBoost.Tests,IntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrew-bn_RedisBoost\tests\RedisBoost.Tests\IntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods).
