Unutilized Abstraction,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,BsonValueMemberProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\BsonValueMemberProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,AdditionalOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\AdditionalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AdditionalOptions (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\AdditionalOptions.cs' [92' 120])' ConnectionDialog (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\ConnectionDialog.cs' [730' 758])
Duplicate Abstraction,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,AdditionalOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\AdditionalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Unutilized Abstraction,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\ConnectionDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,ConnectionPropertiesExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\ConnectionPropertiesExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,HashPair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Comparers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: keyHash' valueHash
Deficient Encapsulation,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,MongoDynamicDataContextDriver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\MongoDynamicDataContextDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CommonTypes
Deficient Encapsulation,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,MongoDynamicDataContextDriver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\MongoDynamicDataContextDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CommonTypes
Insufficient Modularization,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,ConnectionDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\ConnectionDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 43 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,ConnectionDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\ConnectionDialog.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,AdditionalOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\AdditionalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.AdditionalOptions' GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.ConnectionDialog
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,MongoDynamicDataContextDriver,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\MongoDynamicDataContextDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.MongoDynamicDataContextDriver' GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.ConnectionDialog
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver,AdditionalOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\LinqPad Mongo Driver\Connection Dialog\AdditionalOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.AdditionalOptions' GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.ConnectionDialog' GDSX.Externals.LinqPad.Driver.MongoDynamicDataContextDriver
