Unutilized Abstraction,DriverTests,ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,DriverTests,ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests.cs' [178' 201])' ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\ConnectionPropertiesEqualityTests.cs' [213' 236])
Unutilized Abstraction,DriverTests,ConnectionPropertiesSerializationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\ConnectionPropertiesSerializationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DriverTests,TypedDataContext_InterceptorTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\TypedDataContext_InterceptorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.

Unnecessary Abstraction,DriverTests,TestSerializable,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\gburgett_LinqPad-mongo-driver\DriverTests\TypedDataContext_InterceptorTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TestId
