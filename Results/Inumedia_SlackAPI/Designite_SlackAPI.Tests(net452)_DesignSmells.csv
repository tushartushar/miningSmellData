Unutilized Abstraction,SlackAPI.Tests,BlockMessage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Inumedia_SlackAPI\SlackAPI.Tests\BlockMessage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SlackAPI.Tests,Connect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Inumedia_SlackAPI\SlackAPI.Tests\Connect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,SlackAPI.Tests,Connect,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Inumedia_SlackAPI\SlackAPI.Tests\Connect.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: TestManualSubscribePresenceChangeAndManualPresenceChange which is more interested in members of the type: SlackSocketClient

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,SlackAPI.Tests,UserUIInteraction,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Inumedia_SlackAPI\SlackAPI.Tests\UserUIInteraction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SlackAPI.Tests.Configuration,IntegrationCollection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Inumedia_SlackAPI\SlackAPI.Tests\Configuration\IntegrationCollection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
