Unnecessary Abstraction,dbfit,DbEnvironmentFactory,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\environment\DbEnvironmentFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DefaultEnvironment' instance
Unutilized Abstraction,dbfit,ColumnMissingException,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\util\ColumnMissingException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,dbfit.fixture,CompareStoredQueries,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\CompareStoredQueries.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoTable
Imperative Abstraction,dbfit.fixture,Inspect,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\Inspect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: DoTable
Deficient Encapsulation,dbfit,DbConnectionProperties,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\util\DbConnectionProperties.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Service' Username' Password' DbName' FullConnectionString
Deficient Encapsulation,dbfit.fixture,Clean,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\Clean.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: table' columnName' ids' keys' where
Deficient Encapsulation,dbfit.fixture,Inspect,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\Inspect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MODE_PROCEDURE' MODE_TABLE' MODE_QUERY
Deficient Encapsulation,dbfit.fixture,Inspect,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\Inspect.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: MODE_PROCEDURE' MODE_TABLE' MODE_QUERY
Deficient Encapsulation,dbfit.fixture,QueryStats,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\QueryStats.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TableName' Where' Query
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,dbfit,IDbEnvironment,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\environment\DbEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IDbEnvironment' DbParameterAccessor
Insufficient Modularization,dbfit,DatabaseTest,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\DatabaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,dbfit,DatabaseTest,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\DatabaseTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,dbfit,AbstractDbEnvironment,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\environment\AbstractDbEnvironment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetAllProcedureParameters' GetAllColumns
Broken Hierarchy,dbfit,DatabaseTest,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\fixture\DatabaseTest.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SequenceFixture
Rebellious Hierarchy,dbfit.util,IdRetrievalAccessor,F:\newReposMay17\jediwhale_fitsharp\source\dbfit\util\IdRetrievalAccessor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Set
