Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.57  All the dependencies among components: from: dbfit' to: dbfit.util' from: fitSharp.Samples' to: fitSharp.IO' from: fitSharp.Samples.Fit' to: fitSharp.Fit.Service' from:
