Unnecessary Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Options,IOptions,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\IOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Options,IOptionsChangeTokenSource,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\IOptionsChangeTokenSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Options,OptionsBuilder<TOptions>,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\OptionsBuilder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.Options,OptionsMonitorExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\OptionsMonitorExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection,OptionsServiceCollectionExtensions,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\OptionsServiceCollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.Extensions.Options,OptionsCache<TOptions>,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\OptionsCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Clear
Multipath Hierarchy,Microsoft.Extensions.Options,OptionsManager<TOptions>,C:\repos\aspnet_Options\src\Microsoft.Extensions.Options\OptionsManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IOptions
