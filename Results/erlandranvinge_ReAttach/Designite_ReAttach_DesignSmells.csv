Unnecessary Abstraction,ReAttach.Data,ReAttachOptions,C:\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Data\ReAttachOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BuildBeforeReAttach
Unutilized Abstraction,ReAttach.Extensions,ProcessExtensions,C:\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Extensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReAttach.Misc,DebugHelper,C:\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Misc\DebugHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReAttach,Texts,C:\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\ReAttachConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MenuItemPrefix' NoTargetsAvailable
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReAttach.Dialogs,ReAttachOptionsControl,C:\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Dialogs\ReAttachOptionsControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReAttach.Dialogs.ReAttachOptionsControl' ReAttach.Dialogs.ReAttachOptionsPage
