Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReAttach.Data,ReAttachOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Data\ReAttachOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BuildBeforeReAttach
Unutilized Abstraction,ReAttach.Extensions,DebugProcessExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Extensions\DebugProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReAttach.Extensions,ProcessExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Extensions\ProcessExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,ReAttach.Misc,DebugHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Misc\DebugHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,ReAttach,Texts,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\ReAttachConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' MenuItemPrefix' NoTargetsAvailable
Insufficient Modularization,ReAttach.Misc,TypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Misc\TypeHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 107
Broken Modularization,ReAttach,ReAttachConstants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\ReAttachConstants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ReAttachPackageGuidString' ReAttachRegistryKeyName' ReAttachRegistryHistoryKeyPrefix' ReAttachRegistryOptionsKeyName' ReAttachPackageCmdSet' ReAttachCommandId' ReAttachHistorySize' BuildBeforeReAttachCommandId' ReAttachToLastCommandName' ReAttachToLastKeyBinding' IgnoredDebuggingEngines
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReAttach.Dialogs,ReAttachOptionsControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\erlandranvinge_ReAttach\ReAttach\Dialogs\ReAttachOptionsControl.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReAttach.Dialogs.ReAttachOptionsControl' ReAttach.Dialogs.ReAttachOptionsPage
