Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,clipr,clipr,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: clipr' clipr.Fluent
Cyclic Dependency,clipr,clipr.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: clipr.Core' clipr.Triggers
Unstable Dependency,clipr,clipr,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): clipr.Fluent' clipr.Triggers' clipr.Core' clipr.Utils' clipr.Usage
Unstable Dependency,clipr,clipr.Core,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): clipr.Utils
Unstable Dependency,clipr,clipr.Usage,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): clipr.Utils
