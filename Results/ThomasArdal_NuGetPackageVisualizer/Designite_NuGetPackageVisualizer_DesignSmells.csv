Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,DependencyViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\DependencyViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NugetId' Version
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,DgmlColorConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\DgmlColorConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VersionMismatchPackageColor' PackageHasDifferentVersionsColor' DefaultColor
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,GraphVizColorConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\GraphVizColorConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VersionMismatchPackageColor' PackageHasDifferentVersionsColor' DefaultColor
Unutilized Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,GraphVizNodeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\GraphVizNodeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,IColorConfiguration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\IColorConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: VersionMismatchPackageColor' PackageHasDifferentVersionsColor' DefaultColor
Unnecessary Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,PackageViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\PackageViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NugetId' Id' RemoteVersion' LocalVersion' Dependencies
Duplicate Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\Program.cs' [156' 206])' Program (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\Program.cs' [214' 264])
Multifaceted Abstraction,NuGetPackageVisualizer.NuGetService,V2FeedPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\Service References\NuGetService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Broken Modularization,NuGetPackageVisualizer,PackageViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\PackageViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NugetId' Id' RemoteVersion' LocalVersion' Dependencies
Insufficient Modularization,NuGetPackageVisualizer.NuGetService,V2FeedPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\ThomasArdal_NuGetPackageVisualizer\Service References\NuGetService\Reference.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 60 methods
