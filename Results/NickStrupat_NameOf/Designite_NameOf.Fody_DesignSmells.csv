Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,ExtensionAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\ExtensionAttributeFix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,ExtensionAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\ExtensionAttributeFix.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NameOf.Fody,InstructionExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\InstructionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,NameOf.Fody,ModuleWeaver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\ModuleWeaver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,NameOf.Fody,ModuleWeaver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\ModuleWeaver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: OptionalPatternInstruction' OptionalPatternInstruction (in method "ProcessNameOfCallInstruction" of class "ModuleWeaver").
Broken Hierarchy,NameOf.Fody,OptionalPatternInstruction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\PatternInstruction.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NameOf.Fody.PatternInstruction
Broken Hierarchy,NameOf.Fody,NameOfPatternInstruction,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\NameOf.Fody\PatternInstruction.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): NameOf.Fody.PatternInstruction
