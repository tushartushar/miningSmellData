Multifaceted Abstraction,AssemblyToProcess,InstanceClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\InstanceClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Unnecessary Abstraction,AssemblyToProcess,IInterface,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\Invocations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,AssemblyToProcess,Struct,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\Invocations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' object' int32
Multifaceted Abstraction,AssemblyToProcess,StaticClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\StaticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unnecessary Abstraction,AssemblyToProcess,Abc,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\DemoTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,AssemblyToProcess,Def,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\DemoTypes.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Deficient Encapsulation,AssemblyToProcess,InstanceClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\InstanceClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: InstanceClassNullableTypeField' InstanceClassSystemValueTypeField' InstanceClassSystemReferenceTypeField' InstanceClassValueTypeField' InstanceClassReferenceTypeField' InstanceClassValueTypeDelegateField' InstanceClassReferenceTypeDelegateField' InstanceClassDelegateField
Deficient Encapsulation,AssemblyToProcess,StaticClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\StaticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: StaticClassNullableTypeField' StaticClassSystemValueTypeField' StaticClassSystemReferenceTypeField' StaticClassValueTypeField' StaticClassReferenceTypeField' StaticClassValueTypeDelegateField' StaticClassReferenceTypeDelegateField' StaticClassDelegateField
Deficient Encapsulation,AssemblyToProcess,StaticClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\StaticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: StaticClassNullableTypeField' StaticClassSystemValueTypeField' StaticClassSystemReferenceTypeField' StaticClassValueTypeField' StaticClassReferenceTypeField' StaticClassValueTypeDelegateField' StaticClassReferenceTypeDelegateField' StaticClassDelegateField
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AssemblyToProcess,InstanceClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\InstanceClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AssemblyToProcess.InstanceClass' AssemblyToProcess.Invocations
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AssemblyToProcess,StaticClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\StaticClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AssemblyToProcess.StaticClass' AssemblyToProcess.Invocations
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AssemblyToProcess,InstanceClass,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\NickStrupat_NameOf\AssemblyToProcess\InstanceClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
