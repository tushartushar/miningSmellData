Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc.DataServices,Change,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\DataServices\Change.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ChangeType' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc.DataServices,GraphLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\DataServices\GraphLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' X1' Y1' X2' Y2
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc.DataServices,GraphNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\DataServices\GraphNode.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Refs' X' Y
Unnecessary Abstraction,GitScc,GitBashResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitBashResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: HasError' Error' Output
Unutilized Abstraction,GitScc,GitIntellisenseHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitIntellisenseHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,GitScc,GitSccOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitSccOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,GitScc,GitFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitFileStatus.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: isSelected
Broken Modularization,GitScc.DataServices,GraphLink,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\DataServices\GraphLink.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' X1' Y1' X2' Y2
Broken Modularization,GitScc,DiffHunk,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\DiffHunk.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Heading' Lines' OldBlock' NewBlock' FirstLineIndex' LastLineIndex
Insufficient Modularization,GitScc,GitRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitScc,GitRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Insufficient Modularization,GitScc,GitRepository,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitRepository.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 106
Broken Hierarchy,GitScc.DataServices,GraphNode,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\DataServices\GraphNode.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GitScc.DataServices.Commit
Broken Hierarchy,GitScc,GitFileStatusTracker,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\yysun_git-tools\GitApi\GitRepository.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GitScc.GitRepository
