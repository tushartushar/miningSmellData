Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Functional,SqlTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Functional\SqlTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Models,Manufacturer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Models\Manufacturer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' TheId' BuildYear
Unutilized Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,DataContextTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\DataContextTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,DataObjectCommandTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\DataObjectCommandTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,Airplane,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\DataObjectCommandTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' FirstFlight
Unnecessary Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,AnotherAirplaneClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\DataObjectCommandTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AirplaneCode' Name' FirstFlight
Unutilized Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,DataObjectQueryTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\DataObjectQueryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,ProviderFactoryTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\ProviderFactoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Thunderstruck.Test.Functional,SqlTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Functional\SqlTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Broken Modularization,Thunderstruck.Test.Models,WhoResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Models\WhoResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: spid' ecid' status' loginame' hostname' blk' dbname' cmd' request_id
Rebellious Hierarchy,Thunderstruck.Test.Unit,CustomProvider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\wagnerandrade_Thunderstruck\Thunderstruck.Test\Unit\ProviderFactoryTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: SelectAllQuery' SelectTakeQuery' ExecuteGetIdentity
