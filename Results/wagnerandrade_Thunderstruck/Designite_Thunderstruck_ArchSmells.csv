The participating components in the cycle are: Thunderstruck.Runtime' Thunderstruck.Provider,Thunderstruck.Runtime.DataObjectCommand<T>' Thunderstruck.Provider.IDataProvider' Thunderstruck.Provider.DefaultProvider' Thunderstruck.Provider.ProviderFactory
Unstable Dependency,Thunderstruck,Thunderstruck,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Thunderstruck.Runtime' Thunderstruck.Provider,Thunderstruck.ConnectionStringBuffer' Thunderstruck.ProviderFactory' Thunderstruck.IDataProvider' Thunderstruck.DataReader
Unstable Dependency,Thunderstruck,Thunderstruck.Provider,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Thunderstruck.Runtime,Thunderstruck.Provider.ParametersBinder
Feature Concentration,Thunderstruck,Thunderstruck.Runtime,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
