Cyclic Hierarchy,Starstructor.EditorObjects,EditorMap,D:\newReposJune17\Starstructor_starstructor\Starstructor\EditorObjects\EditorMap.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: EditorMapLayer
Missing Hierarchy,Starstructor.EditorObjects,EditorMap,D:\newReposJune17\Starstructor_starstructor\Starstructor\EditorObjects\EditorMap.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: StarboundObject' EditorMapPart (in method "RedrawCanvasFromBrush" of class "EditorMap").
Missing Hierarchy,Starstructor.EditorObjects,EditorMapLayer,D:\newReposJune17\Starstructor_starstructor\Starstructor\EditorObjects\EditorMapLayer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types.
