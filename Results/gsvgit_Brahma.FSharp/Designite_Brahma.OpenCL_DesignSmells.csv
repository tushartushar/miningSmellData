Multipath Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL,Kernel,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\Kernel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IKernel
Rebellious Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL,NDRange,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\NDRange.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetEnumerator
Unfactored Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,ReadBuffer,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\Commands\ReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ReadBuffer[1' 23]' WriteBuffer[1' 23]
Unfactored Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,ReadBuffer,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\Commands\ReadBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ReadBuffer[103' 146]' WriteBuffer[103' 146]
Multipath Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,Run,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\Commands\Run.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: ICommand
Broken Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,Run,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\Commands\Run.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RunBase' ICommand
Rebellious Hierarchy,Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,WaitFor,F:\newReposMay17\gsvgit_Brahma.FSharp\Source\Brahma.OpenCL\Commands\WaitFor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
