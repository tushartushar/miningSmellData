Cyclic Dependency,Brahma.OpenCL,Brahma.OpenCL,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Brahma.OpenCL' Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,Brahma.OpenCL.BufferExtensions' Brahma.OpenCL.Commands.ReadBuffer<T>,Brahma.OpenCL.BufferExtensions' Brahma.OpenCL.Commands.ReadBuffer<T>
Unstable Dependency,Brahma.OpenCL,Brahma.OpenCL,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Brahma.OpenCL.Commands,Brahma.OpenCL.ReadBuffer<T>' Brahma.OpenCL.WriteBuffer<T>' Brahma.OpenCL.Run<TRange>,Brahma.OpenCL.ReadBuffer<T>' Brahma.OpenCL.WriteBuffer<T>' Brahma.OpenCL.Run<TRange>
