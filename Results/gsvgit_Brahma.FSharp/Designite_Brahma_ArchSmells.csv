Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,Brahma,Brahma,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Brahma' Brahma.Commands,Brahma.CommandQueue' Brahma.Commands.Run<TRange>
Unstable Dependency,Brahma,Brahma,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Brahma.Commands,Brahma.Command
Feature Concentration,Brahma,Brahma,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CommandQueue]' [Buffer<T>]' [ComputeProvider]' [Image2D<T>]' [Image3D<T>]' [IImageComponentType]' [IImageFormat]' [IKernel]' [KernelCallableAttribute]' [IMem' Mem<T>]' [NDRange' NDRange<T>]' [INDRangeDimension]' [TypeExtensions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.87,Brahma.NDRange' Brahma.NDRange<T>' Brahma.CommandQueue' Brahma.Buffer<T>' Brahma.ComputeProvider' Brahma.Image2D<T>' Brahma.Image3D<T>' Brahma.IImageComponentType' Brahma.IImageFormat' Brahma.IKernel' Brahma.KernelCallableAttribute' Brahma.INDRangeDimension' Brahma.TypeExtensions
