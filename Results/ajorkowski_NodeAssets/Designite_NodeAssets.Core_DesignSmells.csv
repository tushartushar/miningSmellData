Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,NodeAssets.Compilers,CompileException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\CompileException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NodeAssets.Compilers,CompileResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\ICompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Output' AdditionalDependencies
Unutilized Abstraction,NodeAssets,FileExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\FileExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,NodeAssets.Core,CompileMeasurement,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\ICompilerConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Compiler' File' CompileTimeMilliseconds
Imperative Abstraction,NodeAssets.Core.SourceManager,DefaultSourceCompiler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\SourceManager\DefaultSourceCompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CompileFile
Duplicate Abstraction,NodeAssets.Core.SourceManager,DefaultSourceManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\SourceManager\DefaultSourceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DefaultSourceManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\SourceManager\DefaultSourceManager.cs' [171' 190])' DefaultSourceManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\SourceManager\DefaultSourceManager.cs' [220' 239])
Feature Envy,NodeAssets.Core.SourceManager,DefaultSourceManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\SourceManager\DefaultSourceManager.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Dispose which is more interested in members of the type: IPile
Broken Modularization,NodeAssets,FileExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\FileExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Coffee' Js' Ts' Sass' Scss' Css' Styl' Less' MinJsMin' MinCssMin' JsMin' CssMin
Wide Hierarchy,NodeAssets.Compilers,ICompiler,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ajorkowski_NodeAssets\NodeAssets.Core\ICompiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: NodeAssets.Compilers.CoffeeSharpCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.CssMinifyCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.JsMinifyCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.CoffeeCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.CssoCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.LessCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.StylusCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.UglifyJSCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.SassCompiler' NodeAssets.Compilers.PassthroughCompiler
