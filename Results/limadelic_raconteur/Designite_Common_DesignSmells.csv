Unnecessary Abstraction,Common,User,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limadelic_raconteur\dotNet\Tests\Common\StepDefinitions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' UserName' Password
Unutilized Abstraction,Uncommon,AnotherStepDefinitions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limadelic_raconteur\dotNet\Tests\Common\StepDefinitions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Common,Actors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limadelic_raconteur\dotNet\Tests\Common\Actors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FeatureWithArgs
Deficient Encapsulation,Common,Actors,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limadelic_raconteur\dotNet\Tests\Common\Actors.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: FeatureWithArgs
Deficient Encapsulation,Common,StepDefinitions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\limadelic_raconteur\dotNet\Tests\Common\StepDefinitions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
