Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,InteractiveEditor,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\Interactive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CommandArea
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,InteractiveArea,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\Interactive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstLineIndex' LastLineIndex' Caret' Active
Imperative Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,Progress,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\Progress.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: SetProgressValue
Duplicate Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,SearchFileCommand,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SearchFileCommand (C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs' [288' 307])' SearchFileCommand (C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs' [332' 351])
Imperative Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,SubsetForm,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SubsetForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Show
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,XPathObjectContext,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\XmlTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NameTable' Filter' Stopping' IncrementDirectoryCount' _nameTable
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarNet.Tools,SuperExplorer,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SuperExplorer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FarNet.Tools.SuperExplorer' FarNet.Tools.SuperPanel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarNet.Tools,SuperPanel,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SuperPanel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FarNet.Tools.SuperPanel' FarNet.Tools.SuperExplorer
Insufficient Modularization,FarNet.Tools,XPathObjectNavigator,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\XPathObjectNavigator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,FarNet.Tools,XPathObjectContext,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\XmlTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NameTable' Filter' Stopping' IncrementDirectoryCount' _nameTable
Rebellious Hierarchy,FarNet.Tools,ProgressForm,C:\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\ProgressForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ShowProgress
