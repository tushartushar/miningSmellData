Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,InteractiveArea,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\Interactive.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FirstLineIndex' LastLineIndex' Caret' Active
Unutilized Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,SearchFileCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,SearchFileCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SearchFileCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs' [288' 307])' SearchFileCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SearchFileCommand.cs' [332' 351])
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarNet.Tools,XPathObjectContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\XmlTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NameTable' Filter' Stopping' IncrementDirectoryCount' _nameTable
Insufficient Modularization,FarNet.Tools,XPathObjectNavigator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\XPathObjectNavigator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,FarNet.Tools,XPathObjectContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\XmlTools.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NameTable' Filter' Stopping' IncrementDirectoryCount' _nameTable
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarNet.Tools,SuperExplorer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\SuperExplorer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FarNet.Tools.SuperExplorer' FarNet.Tools.SuperPanel
Rebellious Hierarchy,FarNet.Tools,ProgressForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Tools\ProgressForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ShowProgress
