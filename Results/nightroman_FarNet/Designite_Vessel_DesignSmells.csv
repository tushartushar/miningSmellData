Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarNet.Vessel,Logger,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Source' _Source
Unnecessary Abstraction,FarNet.Vessel,SpanSet,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Spans' Time' _Spans
Unutilized Abstraction,FarNet.Vessel,VesselTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\VesselTool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,FarNet.Vessel,VesselTool,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\VesselTool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  VesselTool (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\VesselTool.cs' [163' 182])' VesselTool (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\VesselTool.cs' [300' 319])
Broken Modularization,FarNet.Vessel,Result,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\Types.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Factor' UpCount' DownCount' SameCount' UpSum' DownSum' TotalSum' Average
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarNet.Vessel,Store,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\Vessel\Store.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FarNet.Vessel.Store' FarNet.Vessel.VesselHost
