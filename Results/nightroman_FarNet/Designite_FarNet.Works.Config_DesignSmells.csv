Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,FarNet.Works,ConfigCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\ConfigCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FarNet.Works,ConfigDrawer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\ConfigDrawer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,FarNet.Works,ConfigDrawerDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\ConfigDrawer.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConfigDrawerDialog which is more interested in members of the type: IDialog
Unutilized Abstraction,FarNet.Works,ConfigEditor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\ConfigEditor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FarNet.Works,ConfigUICulture,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\ConfigUICulture.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,FarNet.Works,ConfigDrawerDialog,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\ConfigDrawer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Dialog' Mask' Priority
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarNet.Works.Config,SettingsExplorer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\SettingsExplorer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FarNet.Works.Config.SettingsExplorer' FarNet.Works.Config.SettingsPanel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FarNet.Works.Config,SettingsExplorer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nightroman_FarNet\FarNet\FarNet.Works.Config\SettingsExplorer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FarNet.Works.Config.SettingsExplorer' FarNet.Works.Config.SettingsUI' FarNet.Works.Config.SettingsPanel
