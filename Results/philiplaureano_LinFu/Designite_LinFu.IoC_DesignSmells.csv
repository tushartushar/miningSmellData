The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateInstance
Wide Hierarchy,LinFu.IoC.Interfaces,IFactory,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.IoC\Interfaces\IFactoryOfT.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: LinFu.AOP.Cecil.Factories.AddInvocationInfoActionFactory' LinFu.AOP.Cecil.Factories.AssemblyWeaverActionFactory' LinFu.AOP.Cecil.Factories.TypeWeaverActionFactory' LinFu.IoC.FactoryAdapter<T>' LinFu.IoC.InstanceFactory' LinFu.IoC.Factories.BaseFactory<T>' LinFu.IoC.Factories.DelegateFactory' LinFu.IoC.Factories.FunctorFactory' LinFu.IoC.Factories.FunctorFactory<T>' LinFu.IoC.Factories.LazyFactory' LinFu.IoC.Factories.LazyFactory<T>' SampleLibrary.IOC.BugFixes.MyFactory' SampleLibrary.IOC.SampleFactoryWithConstructorArguments' SampleLibrary.IOC.SampleStronglyTypedFactoryWithNamedService' SampleLibrary.SampleFactory' SampleLibrary.SampleOpenGenericFactory' SampleLibrary.SampleStronglyTypedFactory
