Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection,AssemblyActionLoader<TTarget>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\AssemblyActionLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection,CollectionExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\CollectionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection,IAssemblyTargetLoader,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\Interfaces\IAssemblyTargetLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: AssemblyLoader' TypeLoaders' AssemblyLoader' TypeLoaders
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection,LoaderPluginAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\LoaderPluginAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection,Runtime,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\Runtime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsRunningOnMono
Unutilized Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection,Runtime,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\Runtime.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,LinFu.Reflection.Plugins,BaseTargetLoaderPlugin<TTarget>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\Plugins\BaseTargetLoaderPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multipath Hierarchy,LinFu.Reflection,AssemblyTargetLoader<TTarget;TAssembly;TType>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\AssemblyTargetLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class inherits another class directly as well as indirectly. The redundant inherited supertype is: IActionLoader
Rebellious Hierarchy,LinFu.Reflection.Plugins,BaseLoaderPlugin<TTarget>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.Reflection\Plugins\BaseLoaderPlugin.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: BeginLoad' EndLoad
