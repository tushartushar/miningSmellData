Insufficient Modularization,LinFu.AOP.Cecil,BaseReflectionVisitor,C:\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.AOP\BaseReflectionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 48 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,LinFu.AOP.Cecil,BaseReflectionVisitor,C:\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.AOP\BaseReflectionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 48 methods
Broken Modularization,LinFu.AOP.Cecil,IMethodBodyRewriterParameters,C:\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.AOP\Interfaces\IMethodBodyRewriterParameters.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TargetMethod' AroundInvokeProvider' MethodReplacementProvider' ClassMethodReplacementProvider' InterceptionDisabled' InvocationInfo' ReturnValue' RegistryType' GetMethodReplacementProviderMethod' OldInstructions
Rebellious Hierarchy,LinFu.AOP.Cecil,BaseMethodRewriter,C:\repos\philiplaureano_LinFu\src\LinFu.AOP\BaseMethodRewriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
