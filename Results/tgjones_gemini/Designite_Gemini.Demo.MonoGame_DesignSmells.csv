Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DemosMenu' DemosMenuGroup
Deficient Encapsulation,Gemini.Demo.MonoGame.Modules.Startup,Module,C:\repos\tgjones_gemini\src\Gemini.Demo.MonoGame\Modules\Startup\Module.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: DemosMenu' DemosMenuGroup
Deficient Encapsulation,Gemini.Demo.MonoGame.Primitives,VertexPositionNormal,C:\repos\tgjones_gemini\src\Gemini.Demo.MonoGame\Primitives\VertexPositionNormal.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Position' Normal
Broken Hierarchy,Gemini.Demo.MonoGame.Primitives,CubePrimitive,C:\repos\tgjones_gemini\src\Gemini.Demo.MonoGame\Primitives\CubePrimitive.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Gemini.Demo.MonoGame.Primitives.GeometricPrimitive
