Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,SystemUtils.Tools,ToolArgDefaultAttribute,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Tools\Common.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Collections.Generic,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.Collections.Generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Collections.Generic,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.Collections.Generic.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: System.Collections.Generic.Extensions' System.Extensions' System.IO.Extensions' System.Linq.Extensions' System.Reflection.Extensions
Unutilized Abstraction,System,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.IO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Linq,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.Linq.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Reflection,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.Reflection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 34 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Linq,Extensions,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Extensions\System.Linq.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Broken Hierarchy,SystemTools.Text,CodeWriter,C:\repos\SharpKit_Cs2Java\src\SystemUtils\Text\CodeWriter.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LineWriterProxy
