Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Dense Structure,<All projects included>,<All namespaces included>,The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.92  All the dependencies among components: from: Benchmark' to: NoSQL.GraphDB' from: Benchmark' to: NoSQL.GraphDB.Service' from: Service' to: NoSQL.GraphDB' from: Service' to:
