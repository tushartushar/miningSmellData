Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unexploited Encapsulation,Raspberry.IO.InterIntegratedCircuit,I2cDriver,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.InterIntegratedCircuit\I2cDriver.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: I2cWriteAction' I2cReadAction (in method "Execute" of class "I2cDriver").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Raspberry.IO.InterIntegratedCircuit,I2cDeviceConnection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.InterIntegratedCircuit\I2cDeviceConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Raspberry.IO.InterIntegratedCircuit.I2cDeviceConnection' Raspberry.IO.InterIntegratedCircuit.I2cDriver
