Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,ReadOnlyTransferBufferException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\Exceptions\ReadonlyTransferBufferException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,SpiTransferBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\SpiTransferBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Dispose
Unutilized Abstraction,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,WriteOnlyTransferBufferException,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\Exceptions\WriteOnlyTransferBufferException.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,SpiTransferControlStructure,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\Interop\SpiTransferControlStructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Tx' Rx' Length' Speed' Delay' BitsPerWord' ChipSelectChange' Pad
Broken Modularization,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,SpiTransferControlStructure,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\Interop\SpiTransferControlStructure.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Tx' Rx' Length' Speed' Delay' BitsPerWord' ChipSelectChange' Pad
Broken Modularization,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,ISpiTransferBuffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\ISpiTransferBuffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: BitsPerWord' Speed' Delay' ChipSelectChange' Pad' TransferMode' Length' Tx' Rx' ControlStructure
Broken Modularization,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,SpiConnectionSettings,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\SpiConnectionSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MaxSpeed' Delay' BitsPerWord' Mode' maxSpeed' delay' bitsPerWord
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface,SpiConnection,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\raspberry-sharp_raspberry-sharp-io\Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface\SpiConnection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface.SpiConnection' Raspberry.IO.SerialPeripheralInterface.SpiSlaveSelectionContext
