Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,QiNiuDrive,FrmFilterTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmFilterTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FrmFilterTester (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmFilterTester.cs' [205' 224])' FilterType (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs' [857' 876])
Imperative Abstraction,QiNiuDrive,FrmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadFilterList
Unnecessary Abstraction,QiNiuDrive.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,QiNiuDrive,SyncFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Timestamp
Deficient Encapsulation,QiNiuDrive,Filter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,QiNiuDrive,ChangeFile,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: OldName' NewName
Insufficient Modularization,QiNiuDrive,FrmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Insufficient Modularization,QiNiuDrive,FrmMain,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmMain.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 179
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,QiNiuDrive,FrmFilterTester,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Unknwon_qiniudrive\FrmFilterTester.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QiNiuDrive.FrmFilterTester' QiNiuDrive.FrmMain
