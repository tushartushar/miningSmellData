Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' InformationalVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf,SerilogConfigurationExtensions,C:\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Serilog\SerilogConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Topshelf.Logging,SerilogLogWriter,C:\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Serilog\Logging\SerilogLogWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Topshelf.Logging,SerilogLogWriter,C:\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Serilog\Logging\SerilogLogWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Topshelf.Logging,SerilogLogWriterFactory,C:\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Serilog\Logging\SerilogLogWriterFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Shutdown
