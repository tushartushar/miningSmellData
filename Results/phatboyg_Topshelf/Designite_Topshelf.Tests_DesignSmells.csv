Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Version' InformationalVersion
Unutilized Abstraction,System,AssemblyVersionInformation,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\SolutionVersion.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf.Tests,When_the_service_start_is_canceled,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\BeforeStart_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf.Tests,Passing_install,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\CommandLine_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Topshelf.Tests,Passing_install,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\CommandLine_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Passing_install (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\CommandLine_Specs.cs' [366' 390])' Using_the_command_line_help_host (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\Help_Specs.cs' [70' 94])
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf.Tests,Using_the_command_line_help_host,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\Help_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Topshelf.Tests,Configuring_service_events,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\ServiceEvent_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Topshelf.Tests,Passing_install,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\CommandLine_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Rebellious Hierarchy,Topshelf.Tests,MyService,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\phatboyg_Topshelf\src\Topshelf.Tests\BeforeStart_Specs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start' Stop' Start' Stop
