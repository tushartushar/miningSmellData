Unnecessary Abstraction,ExaustiveCompletionTester,Config,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\Config.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' PhobosPath
Imperative Abstraction,ExaustiveCompletionTester,FileProcessingData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\FileProcessingData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Process
Duplicate Abstraction,ExaustiveCompletionTester,FileProcessingData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\FileProcessingData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  FileProcessingData (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\FileProcessingData.cs' [145' 197])' FileProcessingData (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\FileProcessingData.cs' [245' 297])
Deficient Encapsulation,ExaustiveCompletionTester,CompletionFacilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\CompletionFacilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: objMod
Deficient Encapsulation,ExaustiveCompletionTester,CompletionFacilities,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\CompletionFacilities.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: objMod
Deficient Encapsulation,ExaustiveCompletionTester,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: activeData' liveWorkerCount
Deficient Encapsulation,ExaustiveCompletionTester,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: activeData' liveWorkerCount
Deficient Encapsulation,ExaustiveCompletionTester,FileProcessingData,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\FileProcessingData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: i' lengthString' ExceptionsTriggered' TimeoutsTriggered
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ExaustiveCompletionTester,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ExaustiveCompletionTester.Program' ExaustiveCompletionTester.FileProcessingData
Rebellious Hierarchy,ExaustiveCompletionTester,SpecializedDataGen,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\aBothe_D_Parser\ExaustiveCompletionTester\SpecializedDataGen.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddCodeGeneratingNodeItem' Add' AddPropertyAttribute' AddTextItem' AddIconItem' Add' AddModule' AddPackage' NotifyTimeout' SetSuggestedItem
