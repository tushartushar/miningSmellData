Duplicate Abstraction,NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache,SharedCacheClient,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\SharedCache\NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache\SharedCacheClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: SharedCacheClient[1' 25]' SharedCacheConfig[1' 25]' SharedCacheProvider[1' 25]
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache,SharedCacheConfig,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\SharedCache\NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache\SharedCacheConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Rebellious Hierarchy,NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache,SharedCacheClient,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\SharedCache\NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache\SharedCacheClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Lock' Unlock
Rebellious Hierarchy,NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache,SharedCacheProvider,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\SharedCache\NHibernate.Caches.SharedCache\SharedCacheProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes.
