Duplicate Abstraction,NHibernate.Caches.Velocity,VelocityClient,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\Velocity\NHibernate.Caches.Velocity\VelocityClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: VelocityClient[1' 36]' VelocityConfig[1' 36]' VelocityProvider[1' 36]
Unnecessary Abstraction,NHibernate.Caches.Velocity,VelocityConfig,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\Velocity\NHibernate.Caches.Velocity\VelocityConfig.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Rebellious Hierarchy,NHibernate.Caches.Velocity,VelocityProvider,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\src\NHibernate.Caches\Velocity\NHibernate.Caches.Velocity\VelocityProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Start' Stop
