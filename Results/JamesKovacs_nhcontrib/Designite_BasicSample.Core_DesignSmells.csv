Unutilized Abstraction,BasicSample.Core.DataInterfaces,IDaoFactory,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\Examples\NHBestPractices\BasicSampleWithBurrowAppBlock\BasicSample.Core\DataInterfaces\IDaoFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BasicSample.Core.DataInterfaces,ICustomerDao,C:\repos\JamesKovacs_nhcontrib\Examples\NHBestPractices\BasicSampleWithBurrowAppBlock\BasicSample.Core\DataInterfaces\IDaoFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class:
