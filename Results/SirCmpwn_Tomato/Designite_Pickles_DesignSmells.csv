Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Deficient Encapsulation,Pickles,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Pickles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CPU' LastTick' Shortcuts
Deficient Encapsulation,Pickles,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Pickles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: CPU' LastTick' Shortcuts
Unexploited Encapsulation,Pickles,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Pickles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: LEM1802' LEM1802 (in method "ParseInput" of class "Program").
Insufficient Modularization,Pickles,Program,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Pickles\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 112
