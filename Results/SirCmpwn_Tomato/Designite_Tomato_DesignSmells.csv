Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tomato,Breakpoint,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\Breakpoint.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Address' Tags
Unutilized Abstraction,Tomato,CodeEntryType,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\CodeEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Tomato,FastDisassembler,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\FastDisassembler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: FastDisassemble
Unnecessary Abstraction,Tomato,InterruptEventArgs,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\InterruptEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: InterruptingDevice' Message
Unutilized Abstraction,Tomato,InterruptEventArgs,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\InterruptEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Tomato,BreakpointEventArgs,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\BreakpointEventArgs.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ContinueExecution' Breakpoint
Deficient Encapsulation,Tomato,DCPU,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\DCPU.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Devices' Breakpoints' InterruptQueue' InterruptQueueEnabled' IsOnFire' Memory' PC' SP' EX' IA' A' B' C' X' Y' Z' I' J' ClockSpeed' IsRunning
Deficient Encapsulation,Tomato,FastDisassembler,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\FastDisassembler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AllowSigned
Deficient Encapsulation,Tomato.Hardware,Device,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\Hardware\Device.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AttachedCPU
Insufficient Modularization,Tomato,DCPU,D:\newReposJune17\SirCmpwn_Tomato\Tomato\DCPU.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 174
