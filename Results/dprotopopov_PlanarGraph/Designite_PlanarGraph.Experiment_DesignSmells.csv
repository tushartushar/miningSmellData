Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,PlanarGraph.Experiment,MatrixIO,C:\repos\dprotopopov_PlanarGraph\PlanarGraph.Experiment\MatrixIO.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: MakeMatrixTitle
Unnecessary Abstraction,PlanarGraph.Experiment,Task,C:\repos\dprotopopov_PlanarGraph\PlanarGraph.Experiment\Task.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: NumberOfVertixes' NumberOfSegments' Graph
Unnecessary Abstraction,PlanarGraph.Experiment.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\dprotopopov_PlanarGraph\PlanarGraph.Experiment\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Broken Modularization,PlanarGraph.Experiment,Experiment,C:\repos\dprotopopov_PlanarGraph\PlanarGraph.Experiment\Experiment.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartDateTime' EndDateTime' NumberOfVertixes' NumberOfSegments' GammaAlgorithmExecutionTime' MacLaneAlgorithmExecutionTime' ResultsAreEqual' IsPlanarByGammaAlgorithm' IsPlanarByMacLaneAlgorithm' Graph
