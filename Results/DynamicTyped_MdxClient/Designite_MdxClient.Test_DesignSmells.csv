Unutilized Abstraction,DynamicTyped.Data.Test,CubeCommandTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamicTyped_MdxClient\MdxClient.Test\CubeCommandTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test,StandardScore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamicTyped_MdxClient\MdxClient.Test\Models.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Label' Score' OverrideLabel
Unnecessary Abstraction,Test,AlertState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamicTyped_MdxClient\MdxClient.Test\Models.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: New' Open' Closed' Total
Insufficient Modularization,DynamicTyped.Data.Test,CubeCommandTest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamicTyped_MdxClient\MdxClient.Test\CubeCommandTest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,Test,Metric,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DynamicTyped_MdxClient\MdxClient.Test\Models.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Label' MdxValue' SqlValue' Score' RawScore' ComparatorScore' Rank' MaxRank' Count' Range1' Range2' Range3' ParentMdxValue' ParentSqlValue' SupplementalLabel' SupplementalMdxValue' SupplementalSqlValue' SupplementalParentMdxValue' HierarchyLevel' SupplementalHiearchyLevel' Weight
