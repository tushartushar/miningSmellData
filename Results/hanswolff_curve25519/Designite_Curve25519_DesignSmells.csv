Unutilized Abstraction,Elliptic,Curve25519,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hanswolff_curve25519\Curve25519\Curve25519.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Elliptic,Long10,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\hanswolff_curve25519\Curve25519\Curve25519.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: N0' N1' N2' N3' N4' N5' N6' N7' N8' N9
