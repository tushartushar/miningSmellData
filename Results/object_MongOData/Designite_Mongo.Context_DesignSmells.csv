Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mongo.Context,Metadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PrefetchRows' FetchPosition' UpdateDynamically' PersistSchema' Default
Deficient Encapsulation,Mongo.Context.Queryable,ExpressionUtils,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\ExpressionUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VisualBasicComparisonOperators
Deficient Encapsulation,Mongo.Context.Queryable,ExpressionUtils,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\ExpressionUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VisualBasicComparisonOperators
Broken Modularization,Mongo.Context,Metadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PrefetchRows' FetchPosition' UpdateDynamically' PersistSchema' Default
Insufficient Modularization,Mongo.Context,MongoMetadata,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mongo.Context.Queryable,MongoQueryableResource,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\MongoQueryableResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mongo.Context.Queryable.MongoQueryableResource' Mongo.Context.Queryable.MongoQueryProvider
