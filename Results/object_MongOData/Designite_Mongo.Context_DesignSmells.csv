Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,Mongo.Context,Metadata,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PrefetchRows' FetchPosition' UpdateDynamically' PersistSchema' Default
Unutilized Abstraction,Mongo.Context,MongoDataServiceBase<T;Q>,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoDataServiceBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Mongo.Context.InMemory,MongoInMemoryDataService,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\InMemory\MongoInMemoryDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Mongo.Context.Queryable,ExpressionUtils,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\ExpressionUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VisualBasicComparisonOperators
Deficient Encapsulation,Mongo.Context.Queryable,ExpressionUtils,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\ExpressionUtils.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VisualBasicComparisonOperators
Broken Modularization,Mongo.Context,Metadata,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoConfiguration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PrefetchRows' FetchPosition' UpdateDynamically' PersistSchema' Default
Insufficient Modularization,Mongo.Context,MongoMetadata,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\MongoMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mongo.Context.Queryable,MongoQueryableResource,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\MongoQueryableResource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mongo.Context.Queryable.MongoQueryableResource' Mongo.Context.Queryable.MongoQueryProvider
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Mongo.Context.Queryable,MongoQueryProvider,C:\repos\object_MongOData\Mongo.Context\Queryable\MongoQueryProvider.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Mongo.Context.Queryable.MongoQueryProvider' Mongo.Context.Queryable.MongoQueryableResource
