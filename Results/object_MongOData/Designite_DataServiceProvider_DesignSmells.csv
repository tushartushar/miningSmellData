Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,DataServiceProvider,DSPDataService,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\DSPDataService.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataServiceProvider,ExtensionMethods,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\DSPMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,DataServiceProvider,ResourcePropertyExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\ResourcePropertyAnnotation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataServiceProvider,ResourcePropertyAnnotation,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\ResourcePropertyAnnotation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResourceAssociationSet
Unutilized Abstraction,DataServiceProvider,ResourceTypeExtensions,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\ResourceTypeAnnotation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,DataServiceProvider,ResourceTypeAnnotation,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\ResourceTypeAnnotation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ResourceSet
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataServiceProvider,DSPLinqQuery,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\DSPLinqQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DSPLinqQuery' DSPLinqQueryProvider
Insufficient Modularization,DataServiceProvider,ExpressionVisitor,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\ExpressionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,DataServiceProvider,ExpressionVisitor,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\ExpressionVisitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,DataServiceProvider,InterceptedQuery,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\InterceptedQuery.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: InterceptedQuery' InterceptingProvider
Rebellious Hierarchy,DataServiceProvider,DSPInMemoryContext,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\DSPInMemoryContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: UpdateResource
Rebellious Hierarchy,DataServiceProvider,DSPQueryableContext,D:\newReposJune17\object_MongOData\DataServiceProvider\DSPQueryableContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: AddResource' UpdateResource' RemoveResource
