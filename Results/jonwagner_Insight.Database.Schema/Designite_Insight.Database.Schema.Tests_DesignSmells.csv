Unutilized Abstraction,Insight.Database.Schema.Tests,AutoProcTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_Insight.Database.Schema\Insight.Database.Schema.Tests\AutoProcTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Insight.Database.Schema.Tests,SingularizerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_Insight.Database.Schema\Insight.Database.Schema.Tests\SingularizerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Unnecessary Abstraction,Insight.Database.Schema.Tests,Beer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_Insight.Database.Schema\Insight.Database.Schema.Tests\UseAutoProcTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ID' Name
Deficient Encapsulation,Insight.Database.Schema.Tests,InstallerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_Insight.Database.Schema\Insight.Database.Schema.Tests\InstallerTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Schemas
Deficient Encapsulation,Insight.Database.Schema.Tests,Beer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_Insight.Database.Schema\Insight.Database.Schema.Tests\UseAutoProcTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ID' Name
Insufficient Modularization,Insight.Database.Schema.Tests,AutoProcTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\jonwagner_Insight.Database.Schema\Insight.Database.Schema.Tests\AutoProcTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
