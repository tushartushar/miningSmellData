Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Neo.IronLua,LuaTraceLineDebugger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neolithos_neolua\NeoLua.Dbg\LuaTraceLineDebugger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: CreateChunk
Feature Envy,Neo.IronLua,TraceCallback,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neolithos_neolua\NeoLua.Dbg\LuaTraceLineDebugger.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: OnTraceEvent which is more interested in members of the type: LuaTraceLineDebugger
Rebellious Hierarchy,Neo.IronLua,LuaTraceLineDebugger,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neolithos_neolua\NeoLua.Dbg\LuaTraceLineDebugger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateChunk
Rebellious Hierarchy,Neo.IronLua,TransformAllLambda,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neolithos_neolua\NeoLua.Dbg\LuaTraceLineDebugger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: VisitBlock
Broken Hierarchy,Neo.IronLua,LuaTraceChunk,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\neolithos_neolua\NeoLua.Dbg\LuaTraceLineDebugger.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Neo.IronLua.LuaChunk
