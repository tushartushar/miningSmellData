Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Segment.Test,ActionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\ActionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Segment.Test,ClientTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\ClientTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Segment.Test,ConnectionTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\ConnectionTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Segment.Test,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' WRITE_KEY
Unutilized Abstraction,Segment.Test,FlushTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\FlushTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Segment.Test,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: WRITE_KEY
Deficient Encapsulation,Segment.Test,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: WRITE_KEY
Broken Hierarchy,Segment.Test,TestClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\segmentio_Analytics.NET\Test.Net45\ClientTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Segment.Client
