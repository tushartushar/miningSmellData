Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,ContentControlXmlMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\ContentControlXmlMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PlaceholderName' PlaceholderType' ControlTagXPath' ControlValueXPath
Unutilized Abstraction,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,ContentControlXmlMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\ContentControlXmlMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,DocumentGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\DocumentGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: GenerateDocument
Unnecessary Abstraction,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,OpenXmlElementDataContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\OpenXmlElementDataContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Element' DataContext
Unnecessary Abstraction,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,DocumentMetadata,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\DocumentMetadata.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: DocumentType' DocumentVersion
Deficient Encapsulation,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,DocumentGenerationInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\DocumentGenerationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: NamespaceUri
Deficient Encapsulation,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,DocumentGenerationInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\DocumentGenerationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: NamespaceUri
Broken Modularization,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,DocumentGenerationInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\DocumentGenerationInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PlaceholderTagToTypeCollection' Metadata' TemplateData' DataContext' IsDataBoundControls' NamespaceUri
Insufficient Modularization,WordDocumentGenerator.Library,OpenXmlHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\tfsbuildextensions_BuildManager\Manager\TfsBuildManager.WordDocumentGenerator.Library\OpenXmlHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 102
