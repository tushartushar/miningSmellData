Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Cassette.Spriting,StylesheetBundleExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\StylesheetBundleExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator,CssImageExtractor,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Generator\CssImageExtractor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ExtractImageUrls
Imperative Abstraction,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Parser,BackgroundImageClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Parser\BackgroundImageClass.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ScoreSpecificity
Feature Envy,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Parser,BackgroundImageClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Parser\BackgroundImageClass.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: BackgroundImageClass which is more interested in members of the type: RegexCache
Unnecessary Abstraction,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Parser,Position,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Parser\Position.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: PositionMode' Offset' Direction
Unutilized Abstraction,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.SpriteStore,ISpriteStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\SpriteStore\ISpriteStore.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,Cassette.Spriting,SpritingSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\SpritingSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SpriteSizeLimit' SpriteColorLimit' ImageQuantizationDisabled' ImageOptimizationDisabled' ImageOptimizationCompressionLevel' IsFullTrust' ShouldSpriteImage
Broken Modularization,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic,ISpritingSettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\ISpritingSettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: SpriteSizeLimit' SpriteColorLimit' ImageQuantizationDisabled' ImageOptimizationDisabled' ImageOptimizationCompressionLevel' IsFullTrust
Broken Modularization,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Utilities,RegexCache,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Utilities\RegexCache.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ImageUrlPattern' OffsetPattern' RepeatPattern' WidthPattern' HeightPattern' PaddingPattern' SelectorSplitPattern' PseudoElementPattern
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator,SpritedImage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Generator\SpritedImage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.SpritedImage' Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.SpriteManager
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator,ISpriteContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Generator\ISpriteContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.ISpriteContainer' Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.SpriteManager' Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.SpritedImage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator,ISpriteManager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Generator\ISpriteManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.ISpriteManager' Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.SpriteManager' Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator.SpritedImage
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassette.Spriting.Spritastic.Generator,SpriteContainer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\andrewdavey_cassette\src\Cassette.Spriting\Spritastic\Generator\SpriteContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
