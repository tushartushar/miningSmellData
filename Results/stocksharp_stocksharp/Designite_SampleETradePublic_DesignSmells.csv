Duplicate Abstraction,SampleETrade,StopOrdersWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\StopOrdersWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StopOrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\StopOrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [29' 55])' OrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\OrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [31' 57])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SampleETrade.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ConsumerKey' Sandbox' AccessToken' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleETrade,SecuritiesWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\SecuritiesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleETrade.SecuritiesWindow' SampleETrade.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleETrade,MainWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleETrade.MainWindow' SampleETrade.SecuritiesWindow
Broken Modularization,SampleETrade.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\ETrade\SampleETrade\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' ConsumerKey' Sandbox' AccessToken' defaultInstance
