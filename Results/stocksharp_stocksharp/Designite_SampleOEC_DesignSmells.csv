Duplicate Abstraction,SampleOEC,OrdersWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\OpenECry\SampleOEC\OrdersWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\OpenECry\SampleOEC\OrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [31' 57])' StopOrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\OpenECry\SampleOEC\StopOrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [29' 55])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SampleOEC.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\OpenECry\SampleOEC\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
