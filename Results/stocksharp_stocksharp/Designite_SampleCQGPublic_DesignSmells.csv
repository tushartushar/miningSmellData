Duplicate Abstraction,SampleCQG,StopOrdersWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\StopOrdersWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  StopOrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\StopOrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [29' 55])' OrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\OrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [31' 57])
Unnecessary Abstraction,SampleCQG.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' Username' Address' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleCQG,ChartWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\ChartWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleCQG.ChartWindow' SampleCQG.SecuritiesWindow' SampleCQG.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleCQG,SecuritiesWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\SecuritiesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleCQG.SecuritiesWindow' SampleCQG.MainWindow' SampleCQG.ChartWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleCQG,MainWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\CQG\SampleCQG\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleCQG.MainWindow' SampleCQG.ChartWindow' SampleCQG.SecuritiesWindow
