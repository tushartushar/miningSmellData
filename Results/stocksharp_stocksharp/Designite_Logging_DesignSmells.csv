Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,StockSharp.Logging,ErrorLoggingAttribute,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\ErrorLoggingAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,StockSharp.Logging,LoggingHelper,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\LoggingHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,StockSharp.Logging,LogSourceList,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\LogManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,StockSharp.Logging,TraceListenerEx,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\TraceSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,StockSharp.Logging,ILogSource,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\ILogSource.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name' Parent' LogLevel' CurrentTime' IsRoot
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StockSharp.Logging,Log4NetLogger,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\Log4NetLogListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StockSharp.Logging.Log4NetLogger' StockSharp.Logging.Log4NetLogListener
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StockSharp.Logging,Log4NetLogListener,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\Log4NetLogListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StockSharp.Logging.Log4NetLogListener' StockSharp.Logging.Log4NetLogger
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StockSharp.Logging,LogManager,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\LogManager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StockSharp.Logging.LogManager' StockSharp.Logging.MemoryStatistics
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,StockSharp.Logging,MemoryStatistics,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\MemoryStatistics.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StockSharp.Logging.MemoryStatistics' StockSharp.Logging.LogManager
Wide Hierarchy,StockSharp.Logging,BaseLogReceiver,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\ILogReceiver.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: StockSharp.Algo.Connector' StockSharp.Algo.MarketRuleContainer' StockSharp.Algo.Candles.Compression.CandleBuilder<TCandleMessage>' StockSharp.Algo.Import.CsvParser' StockSharp.Algo.Storages.CachedBasketMarketDataStorage<T>' StockSharp.Algo.Risk.RiskManager' StockSharp.Algo.Risk.RiskRule' StockSharp.Algo.Candles.CandleManager' StockSharp.Algo.Strategies.Strategy' StockSharp.Algo.Testing.MarketEmulator' StockSharp.Algo.Testing.SecurityMarketEmulator' StockSharp.Logging.ApplicationReceiver' StockSharp.Logging.MemoryStatistics' StockSharp.Messages.MessageAdapter' SampleLogging.TestSource' SampleLogging.TestSource
Broken Hierarchy,StockSharp.Logging,Source,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\Log4NetLogListener.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StockSharp.Logging.BaseLogSource
Broken Hierarchy,StockSharp.Logging,DisposeLogMessage,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Logging\LogManager.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): StockSharp.Logging.LogMessage
