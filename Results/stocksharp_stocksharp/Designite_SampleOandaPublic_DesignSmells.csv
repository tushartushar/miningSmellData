Duplicate Abstraction,SampleOanda,OrdersWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\OrdersWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  OrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\OrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [31' 57])' StopOrdersWindow (C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\StopOrdersWindow.xaml.cs' [29' 55])
Unutilized Abstraction,SampleOanda,QuotesWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\QuotesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SampleOanda.Properties,Settings,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,SampleOanda,MainWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Trader
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleOanda,ChartWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\ChartWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleOanda.ChartWindow' SampleOanda.SecuritiesWindow' SampleOanda.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleOanda,ChartWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\ChartWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleOanda.ChartWindow' SampleOanda.SecuritiesWindow' SampleOanda.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleOanda,MainWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleOanda.MainWindow' SampleOanda.SecuritiesWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleOanda,MainWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\MainWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleOanda.MainWindow' SampleOanda.ChartWindow' SampleOanda.SecuritiesWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleOanda,SecuritiesWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\SecuritiesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SampleOanda.SecuritiesWindow' SampleOanda.MainWindow
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SampleOanda,SecuritiesWindow,C:\repos\stocksharp_stocksharp\Samples\Oanda\SampleOanda\SecuritiesWindow.xaml.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
