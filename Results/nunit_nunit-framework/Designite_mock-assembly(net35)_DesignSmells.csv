Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Assemblies,MockTestFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nunit_nunit-framework\src\NUnitFramework\mock-assembly\MockAssembly.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Duplicate Abstraction,Assemblies,MockTestFixture,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nunit_nunit-framework\src\NUnitFramework\mock-assembly\MockAssembly.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Assemblies.MockTestFixture' TestAssembly.MockTestFixture
Unnecessary Abstraction,NUnit.Tests,GenericFixtureConstants,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nunit_nunit-framework\src\NUnitFramework\mock-assembly\MockAssembly.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Tests' Suites
Unutilized Abstraction,NUnit.Tests,GenericFixture<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\nunit_nunit-framework\src\NUnitFramework\mock-assembly\MockAssembly.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
