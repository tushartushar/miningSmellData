Unnecessary Abstraction,Diplo.TraceLogViewer.Tests,Configuration,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanDiplo_UmbracoTraceLogViewer\Diplo.TraceLogViewer.Tests\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' logFilesPath' TestLogsDirectory' UmbracoFile' UmbracoBigFile
Unutilized Abstraction,Diplo.TraceLogViewer.Tests,LogFileTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\DanDiplo_UmbracoTraceLogViewer\Diplo.TraceLogViewer.Tests\LogFileTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
