Transactions in ADO.NET and Entity Framework\ATM.Models\Mapping\TransactionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CardNumber' CardPIN' MoneyToRetrieve
Unutilized Abstraction,ATM.Models.Mapping,TransactionInfo,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Databases\13. Transactions in ADO.NET and Entity Framework\ATM.Models\Mapping\TransactionInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Broken Modularization,ATM.Models,TransactionsHistory,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Databases\13. Transactions in ADO.NET and Entity Framework\ATM.Models\TransactionsHistory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: TransactionsHistoryId' TransactionDate' Ammount' CardAccountId' CardAccount' cardAccount
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ATM.Models,CardAccount,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Databases\13. Transactions in ADO.NET and Entity Framework\ATM.Models\CardAccount.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ATM.Models.CardAccount' ATM.Models.TransactionsHistory
