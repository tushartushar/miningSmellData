Unnecessary Abstraction,AcademyPopcorn,ConsoleInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\ConsoleInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,AcademyPopcorn,ConsoleInterface,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\ConsoleInterface.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,AcademyPopcorn,Engine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\Engine.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MovingObject' Racket (in method "AddObject" of class "Engine").
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,AcademyPopcorn,IObjectProducer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\Interfaces\IObjectProducer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: AcademyPopcorn.IObjectProducer' AcademyPopcorn.GameObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,AcademyPopcorn,Block,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\Block.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Update
Rebellious Hierarchy,AcademyPopcorn,IndestructibleBlock,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\IndestructibleBlock.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RespondToCollision
Cyclic Hierarchy,AcademyPopcorn,IObjectProducer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\Interfaces\IObjectProducer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: GameObject
Rebellious Hierarchy,AcademyPopcorn,GameObject,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\GameObject.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: RespondToCollision
Rebellious Hierarchy,AcademyPopcorn,Racket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\flextry_Telerik-Academy\Programming with C#\3. C# Object-Oriented Programming\08. OOP Practical Workshop - Academy Popcorn\AcademyPopcorn\AcademyPopcorn\Racket.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Update
