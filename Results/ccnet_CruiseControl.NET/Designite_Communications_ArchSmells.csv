Cyclic Dependency,Communications,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Parameters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Parameters' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Parameters.BooleanParameter' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CommunicationsEventArgs' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CruiseServerClient' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.ProjectStatus
Unstable Dependency,Communications,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.BuildCondition' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.NameValuePair' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.IFileTransfer' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.MessageKind' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.CruiseServerSnapshot' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.ProjectStatusSnapshot
Unstable Dependency,Communications,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Parameters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Parameters.NameValuePair
God Component,Communications,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 45,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.BuildCondition' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.ClientStartUpSettings' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.IntegrationStatus' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.ItemBuildStatus' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.MessageKind' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.ProjectIntegratorState' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.BinaryDataEventArgs' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CommunicationsEventArgs' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.IFileTransfer' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.IWebClientFactory' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.MessageReceivedEventArgs' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.ProjectStatusSnapshot' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.SerializableDateTime' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.WebClientFactory<TClient>' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.BuildSummary' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.ExternalLink
God Component,Communications,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 34,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.ChangePasswordRequest' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.CommunicationsMessage' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.DiagnoseSecurityRequest' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.MessageRequest' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Messages.ReadAuditRequest
Feature Concentration,Communications,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Security,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AuditFilterBase' AuditFilters' AuditRecord' CombinationAuditFilter' DateRangeAuditFilter' EventTypeAuditFilter' ProjectAuditFilter' SecurityEvent' SecurityRight' SecurityRightAuditFilter' UserAuditFilter]' [SecurityCheckDiagnostics]' [UserDetails]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.23,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.Security.UserDetails
