Imperative Abstraction,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Start
Feature Envy,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: LoadPage which is more interested in members of the type: WizardPageBase
Imperative Abstraction,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationEngine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationEngine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Deficient Encapsulation,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AllowedVersions
Deficient Encapsulation,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AllowedVersions
Broken Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationOptions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MigrateServer' CurrentServerLocation' NewServerLocation' BackupServerConfiguration' MigrateConfiguration' BackupConfiguration' ConfigurationLocation' MigrateWebDashboard' CurrentWebDashboardLocation' NewWebDashboardLocation' CurrentVersion' AllowedVersions
Insufficient Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,WizardPageBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\WizardPageBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainForm' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainFormController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainForm' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainFormController' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.WizardPageBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,IntroductionPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\IntroductionPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.IntroductionPage' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainForm' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainFormController' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.WizardPageBase
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,IntroductionPage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\IntroductionPage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.IntroductionPage' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainForm' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.MainFormController' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.WizardPageBase' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard.VersionSelectionPage
