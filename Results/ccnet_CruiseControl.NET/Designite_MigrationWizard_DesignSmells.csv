Deficient Encapsulation,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationOptions,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: AllowedVersions
Deficient Encapsulation,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationOptions,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: AllowedVersions
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MainForm,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainForm' MainFormController
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MainForm,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MainForm' MainFormController' WizardPageBase
Broken Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,MigrationOptions,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\MigrationOptions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: MigrateServer' CurrentServerLocation' NewServerLocation' BackupServerConfiguration' MigrateConfiguration' BackupConfiguration' ConfigurationLocation' MigrateWebDashboard' CurrentWebDashboardLocation' NewWebDashboardLocation' CurrentVersion' AllowedVersions
Insufficient Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,WizardPageBase,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\WizardPageBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,WizardPageBase,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\WizardPageBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: WizardPageBase' MainForm' MainFormController' MainForm' MainFormController
Unfactored Hierarchy,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,ConfigurationOptionsPage,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\ConfigurationOptionsPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ConfigurationOptionsPage[103' 130]' ServerOptionsPage[105' 132]' WebDashboardOptionsPage[97' 124]
Unfactored Hierarchy,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.MigrationWizard,ConfigurationOptionsPage,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\MigrationWizard\ConfigurationOptionsPage.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: ConfigurationOptionsPage[103' 131]' WebDashboardOptionsPage[97' 125]
