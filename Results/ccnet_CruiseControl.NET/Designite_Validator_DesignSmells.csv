Duplicate Abstraction,Validator,AboutForm,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\AboutForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: AboutForm[48' 74]' MainForm[789' 815]
Unutilized Abstraction,Validator,ConfigurationTypeDescriptor,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\ConfigurationTypeDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Validator,VersionInformationForm,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\VersionInformationForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadInformation
Unnecessary Abstraction,Validator.Properties,Settings,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Validator,HtmlAttribute,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\HtmlAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Value
Insufficient Modularization,Validator,MainForm,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Missing Hierarchy,Validator,ConfigurationHierarchy,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\ConfigurationHierarchy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IProject' IQueueConfiguration (in method "Add" of class "ConfigurationHierarchy").
Missing Hierarchy,Validator,MainForm,F:\newReposMay17\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IProject' IQueueConfiguration (in method "ValidateElement" of class "MainForm").
