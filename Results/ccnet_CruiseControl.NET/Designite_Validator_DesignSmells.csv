Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Multifaceted Abstraction,Validator,AboutForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\AboutForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.86
Unutilized Abstraction,Validator,ConfigurationHierarchy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\ConfigurationHierarchy.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Validator,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitialisePersistence which is more interested in members of the type: PersistWindowState
Imperative Abstraction,Validator,VersionInformationForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\VersionInformationForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: LoadInformation
Unnecessary Abstraction,Validator.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,Validator,HtmlAttribute,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\HtmlAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Value
Deficient Encapsulation,Validator,CompletionClosure,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Handler' done
Deficient Encapsulation,Validator,ConfigurationItem,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Name' Configuration
Insufficient Modularization,Validator,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 42 methods
Missing Hierarchy,Validator,ConfigurationHierarchy,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\ConfigurationHierarchy.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IProject' IQueueConfiguration (in method "Add" of class "ConfigurationHierarchy").
Rebellious Hierarchy,Validator,PropertyDescriptorBase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\ConfigurationTypeDescriptor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ResetValue' SetValue
Missing Hierarchy,Validator,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IProject' IQueueConfiguration (in method "ValidateElement" of class "MainForm").
Missing Hierarchy,Validator,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ccnet_CruiseControl.NET\project\Validator\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IConfigurationValidation' IConfigurationValidation (in method "InternalValidation" of class "MainForm").
