Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Unstable Dependency,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): CruiseControl.Core' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote
Unstable Dependency,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Configuration,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Monitoring
Unstable Dependency,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Speech,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Presentation
God Component,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Monitoring,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 47
God Component,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Presentation,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 50
Feature Concentration,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Audio]' [BuildOccurredEventArgs' BuildTransition' ErrorLevel]' [CCTimeFormatter]' [CCTrayLibException]' [DateTimeProvider]' [DefaultProjectIcons]' [DefaultQueueIcons]' [IconNotFoundException]' [NotifyInfoFlags2]' [StatusIcon]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.83
Feature Concentration,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.X10,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Cm11Message]' [Cm11LowLevelDriver' Cm11LowLevelDriverError' IX10LowLevelDriver' LampController' LowLevelDriverFactory' ControllerType' Function' Cm17LowLevelDriver' ILampController' X10Controller]' [HouseCode]' [X10Definitions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.31
Scattered Functionality,CCTrayLib,ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Presentation,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Configuration' ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.CCTrayLib.Monitoring
