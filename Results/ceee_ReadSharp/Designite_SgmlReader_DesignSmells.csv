Duplicate Abstraction,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlParseException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  SgmlParseException (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlParser.cs' [1' 24])' CaseFolding (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlReader.cs' [12' 35])

Unutilized Abstraction,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlDtd,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 115
Insufficient Modularization,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 237
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,SgmlParseException,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml.SgmlParseException' ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml.Entity
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,ReadSharp.Ports.Sgml,ElementDecl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\ceee_ReadSharp\PortablePorts\SgmlReader\SgmlParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
