Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitor.UnitTests.Domain,MonitorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor.UnitTests\Domain\MonitorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,BuildMonitor.UnitTests.Domain,MonitorTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor.UnitTests\Domain\MonitorTests.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: SolutionBuildStop_WithSolution_RaisesSolutionBuildFinished which is more interested in members of the type: Monitor

Rebellious Hierarchy,BuildMonitor.UnitTests.Fakes,BuildFactoryFake,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor.UnitTests\Fakes\BuildFactoryFake.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: CreateProjectBuild
