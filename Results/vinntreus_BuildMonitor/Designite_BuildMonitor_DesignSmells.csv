Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,IProjectBuild,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\IProjectBuild.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Started' Project
Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,ProjectBuildComparer,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Monitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,ProjectBuildData,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Monitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,IProject,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Project.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Id' Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,Project,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Project.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name' Id
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,ISolution,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Solution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitor.Domain,Solution,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Solution.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Name
Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitor,IntExtensions,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\IntExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitor.LocalData,InvalidData,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\LocalData\InvalidData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Source' Data
Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitor.UI,LongExtensions,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\UI\LongExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,BuildMonitor.Domain,Monitor,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\Monitor.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SolutionBuildFinished' ProjectBuildFinished
Broken Hierarchy,BuildMonitor.Domain,ProjectBuild,C:\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitor\Domain\ProjectBuild.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BuildMonitor.Domain.Build' BuildMonitor.Domain.IProjectBuild
