Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitorPackage,GuidList,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\Guids.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' guidBuildMonitorPackagePkgString' guidBuildMonitorPackageCmdSetString' guidBuildMonitorPackageCmdSet
Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitorPackage,BuildMonitorPackage,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\BuildMonitorPackage.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,BuildMonitorPackage,OptionKey,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' SolutionId
Unutilized Abstraction,BuildMonitorPackage,OptionKey,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,BuildMonitorPackage,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RepositoryPath
Deficient Encapsulation,BuildMonitorPackage,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: RepositoryPath
Broken Hierarchy,BuildMonitorPackage,DataAdjusterWithLogging,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\vinntreus_BuildMonitor\BuildMonitorPackage\DataAdjusterWithLogging.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BuildMonitor.LocalData.DataAdjuster
