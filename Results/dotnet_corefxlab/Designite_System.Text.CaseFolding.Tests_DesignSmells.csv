Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests,CharUnicodeInfoTestCase,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests\Unicode\TestUnicodeSimpleCaseFoldingData.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Utf32CodeValue' CodePoint' GeneralCategory' NumericValue
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests,FoldCharTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests\Unicode\TestUnicodeSimpleCaseFoldingFoldChar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests,FoldStringAndSpanTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests\Unicode\TestUnicodeSimpleCaseFoldingFoldSpan.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests,IndexOfTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests\Unicode\TestUnicodeSimpleCaseFoldingIndexOf.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests,SimpleCaseFoldingStringComparerTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Text.CaseFolding.Tests\Unicode\TestUnicodeSimpleFoldedStringComparer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
