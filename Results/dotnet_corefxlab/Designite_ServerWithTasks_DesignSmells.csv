Imperative Abstraction,SimpleHttpServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Run
Unnecessary Abstraction,SimpleHttpServer,HttpContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Request' Response
Unutilized Abstraction,SimpleHttpServer,Extensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,SimpleHttpServer,RequestParser,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\RequestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ParseRequest
Deficient Encapsulation,SimpleHttpServer,ParseResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\RequestParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _method' _parseOK' _pathStart' _pathEnd' _headerCount' _lineStart' _valueStart
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleHttpServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimpleHttpServer.Server' SimpleHttpServer.Response
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SimpleHttpServer,Server,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\SimpleHttpWithTasks\Program.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SimpleHttpServer.Server' SimpleHttpServer.Response' SimpleHttpServer.HttpContext
