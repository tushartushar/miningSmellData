Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.CommandLine,CommandLine,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\Helpers\CommandLine.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Diagnostics,ConsoleTraceListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\Helpers\ConsoleTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO.Pipelines,PipelinesExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\Helpers\PipelinesExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Azure.Storage.Requests,IStorageRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\StorageRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Client' RequestPath' CanonicalizedResource' ContentLength' ConsumeBody
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Net.Experimental,SocketPipe,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\SocketPipe.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Log
Broken Modularization,System.Azure.Storage.Requests,IStorageRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\StorageRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Client' RequestPath' CanonicalizedResource' ContentLength' ConsumeBody
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Azure.Storage,StorageClient,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\StorageClient.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Azure.Storage.StorageClient' System.Azure.Storage.Requests.IStorageRequest
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Azure.Storage.Requests,Writer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\StorageRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Azure.Storage.Requests.Writer' System.Azure.Storage.Requests.CreateFileRequest
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Azure.Storage.Requests,GetFileRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\StorageRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Azure.Storage.Requests.GetFileRequest' System.Azure.Storage.Requests.Writer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Azure.Storage.Requests,CreateFileRequest,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\StorageRequests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Azure.Storage.Requests.CreateFileRequest' System.Azure.Storage.Requests.Writer' System.Azure.Storage.Requests.GetFileRequest
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Diagnostics,ConsoleTraceListener,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\samples\AzCopyCore\AzCopyCore\Helpers\ConsoleTraceListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Write' WriteLine
