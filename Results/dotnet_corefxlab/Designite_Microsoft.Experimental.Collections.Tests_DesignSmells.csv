Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Collections.Extensions.Tests,DictionarySlimTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Experimental.Collections.Tests\DictionarySlimTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Collections.Extensions.Tests,DictionarySlimTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Experimental.Collections.Tests\DictionarySlimTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods

Rebellious Hierarchy,Microsoft.Collections.Extensions.Tests,Collider,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Experimental.Collections.Tests\DictionarySlimTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetHashCode' Equals' ToString' GetHashCode' Equals' ToString
