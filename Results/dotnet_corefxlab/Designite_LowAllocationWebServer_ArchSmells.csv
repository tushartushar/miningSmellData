Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,LowAllocationWebServer,Microsoft.Net,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Microsoft.Net' System.Diagnostics,Microsoft.Net.BufferSequence' Microsoft.Net.HttpRequest' Microsoft.Net.HttpServer' System.Diagnostics.HttpLogExtensions
Unstable Dependency,LowAllocationWebServer,System.Diagnostics,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Microsoft.Net,System.Diagnostics.HttpRequest
Feature Concentration,LowAllocationWebServer,Microsoft.Net,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BufferSequence' HttpServer' RoutingServer<T>' TcpConnectionFormatter' HttpRequest' ApiRoutingTable<TRequestId>]' [Header]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29,Microsoft.Net.Header
Feature Concentration,LowAllocationWebServer,Microsoft.Net.Interop,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SocketImports' SocketOptionLevel' sockaddr_in' in_addr' SocketOptionName' ADDRESS_FAMILIES]' [SOCKET_TYPE]' [PROTOCOL]' [WSDATA]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44,Microsoft.Net.Interop.SOCKET_TYPE' Microsoft.Net.Interop.PROTOCOL' Microsoft.Net.Interop.WSDATA
