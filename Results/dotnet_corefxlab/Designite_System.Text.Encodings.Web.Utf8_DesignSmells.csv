Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8,UrlDecoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8\UrlDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Utf8
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8,UrlDecoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8\UrlDecoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8,UrlEncoder,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8\UrlEncoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8.UrlEncoder' System.Text.Encodings.Web.Utf8UriEncoder
