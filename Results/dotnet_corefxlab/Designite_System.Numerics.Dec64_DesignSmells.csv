Multifaceted Abstraction,System.Numerics,Dec64,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Numerics.Dec64\System\Numerics\Dec64.Comparable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Numerics,Dec64,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Numerics.Dec64\System\Numerics\Dec64.Comparable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System.Numerics,Dec64,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Numerics.Dec64\System\Numerics\Dec64.Comparable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Numerics,Dec64,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Numerics.Dec64\System\Numerics\Dec64.Comparable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 45 methods
