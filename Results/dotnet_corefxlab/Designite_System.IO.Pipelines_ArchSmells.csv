Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause,Responsible Classes
Cyclic Dependency,System.IO.Pipelines,System.Buffers,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: System.Buffers' System.IO.Pipelines,System.Buffers.MemoryPool' System.IO.Pipelines.Pipe
Unstable Dependency,System.IO.Pipelines,System.IO.Pipelines,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): System.Buffers,System.IO.Pipelines.MemoryPool
God Component,System.IO.Pipelines,System.IO.Pipelines,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 36,System.IO.Pipelines.FlushResult' System.IO.Pipelines.IPipe' System.IO.Pipelines.IPipeConnection' System.IO.Pipelines.CancelledState' System.IO.Pipelines.PipeCompletionCallback' System.IO.Pipelines.ExceptionArgument' System.IO.Pipelines.ExceptionResource
