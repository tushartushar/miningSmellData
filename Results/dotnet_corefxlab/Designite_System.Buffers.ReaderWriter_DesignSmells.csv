Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers,BufferReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Reader\BufferReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers,BufferReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Reader\BufferReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 41 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers,BufferReader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Reader\BufferReader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 121
Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers,ReaderExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Reader\BufferReader_binary.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods

Total methods in the class: 30 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers.Writer,BufferWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Writer\BufferWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 69 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers.Writer,BufferWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Writer\BufferWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 77 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System.Buffers.Writer,BufferWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Writer\BufferWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 157
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.Buffers.Writer,BufferWriter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.ReaderWriter\System\Buffers\Writer\BufferWriter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: ToString
