Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling.Properties,Strings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\Properties\Strings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,System.IO,PollingFileSystemWatcher,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PollingFileSystemWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: UpdateState which is more interested in members of the type: PathToFileStateHashtable
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO,Comparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\FileChangeList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Default
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO,Comparer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\FileChangeList.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Default
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO,FileState,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\FileState.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Path' Directory' LastWriteTimeUtc' Length
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO,Bucket,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PathToFileStateHashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Key' ValuesIndex
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO,FullPath,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PathToFileStateHashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Directory' File
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO,FileSystemChangeEnumerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\FileSystemChangesEnumerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.FileSystemChangeEnumerator' System.IO.PollingFileSystemWatcher
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.IO,FileSystemChangeEnumerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\FileSystemChangesEnumerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnDirectoryFinished' ShouldRecurseIntoEntry
