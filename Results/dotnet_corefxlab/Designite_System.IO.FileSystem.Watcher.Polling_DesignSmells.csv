Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.IO.FileSystem,FILETIME,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\InteropDeclarations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Time' TimeLow' TimeHigh
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO.FileSystem,PollingWatcher,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PollingWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,Comparer,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\Datastructures.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Default
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,Comparer,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\Datastructures.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: Default
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,FileState,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\Datastructures.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Path' Directory' LastWrite' FileSize
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,WIN32_FIND_DATAW,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\InteropDeclarations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: dwFileAttributes' ftCreationTime' ftLastAccessTime' ftLastWriteTime' nFileSizeHigh' nFileSizeLow' dwReserved0' dwReserved1' cFileName' cAlternate
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,FILETIME,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\InteropDeclarations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TimeLow' TimeHigh
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,Bucket,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PathToFileStateHashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Key' ValuesIndex
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,FullPath,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PathToFileStateHashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Directory' File
Deficient Encapsulation,System.IO.FileSystem,PollingWatcher,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PollingWatcher.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Changed' ChangedDetailed
Broken Modularization,System.IO.FileSystem,WIN32_FIND_DATAW,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\InteropDeclarations.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: FileSize' LastWrite' IsDirectory' MAX_PATH' MAX_ALTERNATE' dwFileAttributes' ftCreationTime' ftLastAccessTime' ftLastWriteTime' nFileSizeHigh' nFileSizeLow' dwReserved0' dwReserved1' cFileName' cAlternate
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.FileSystem,PathToFileStateHashtable,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PathToFileStateHashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.FileSystem.PathToFileStateHashtable' System.IO.FileSystem.Enumerator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.FileSystem,Enumerator,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher.Polling\System\IO\PathToFileStateHashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency.
