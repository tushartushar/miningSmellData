Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests,ArrowIntegrationTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests\ArrowIntegrationTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests,BufferTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests\BufferTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests,DataFrameTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests\DataFrame.IOTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests,DataFrameTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests\DataFrame.IOTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 54 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests,DataFrameTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests\DataFrame.IOTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 56 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests,DataFrameTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\Microsoft.Data.Analysis.Tests\DataFrame.IOTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 153
