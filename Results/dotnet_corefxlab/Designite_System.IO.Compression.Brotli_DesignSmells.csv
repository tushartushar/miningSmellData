Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.IO.Compression,Interop,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\Interop\Interop.Brotli.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.IO.Compression,Library,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\Interop\Library.Windows.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' BrotliEncoder' BrotliDecoder
Unutilized Abstraction,System.IO.Compression,Library,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\Interop\Library.Windows.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.Compression,Brotli,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\Interop\Interop.Brotli.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.Compression.Brotli' System.IO.Compression.BrotliNative
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.Compression,Brotli,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\Interop\Interop.Brotli.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.Compression.Brotli' System.IO.Compression.BrotliNative' System.IO.Compression.State
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.Compression,State,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\IO\Compression\Brotli.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.Compression.State' System.IO.Compression.Brotli' System.IO.Compression.BrotliNative
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.Compression,State,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\IO\Compression\Brotli.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.Compression.State' System.IO.Compression.Brotli' System.IO.Compression.BrotliNative
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.Compression,BrotliNative,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\IO\Compression\BrotliNative.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.Compression.BrotliNative' System.IO.Compression.Brotli
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System.IO.Compression,BrotliNative,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\IO\Compression\BrotliNative.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.IO.Compression.BrotliNative' System.IO.Compression.State' System.IO.Compression.Brotli
Rebellious Hierarchy,System.IO.Compression,BrotliStream,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.IO.Compression.Brotli\System\IO\Compression\BrotliStream.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Seek' SetLength
