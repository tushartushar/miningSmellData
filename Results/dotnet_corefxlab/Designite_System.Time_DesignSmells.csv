Duplicate Abstraction,System,Date,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Date.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Date (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Date.cs' [646' 666])' Time (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Time.cs' [718' 738])

Unutilized Abstraction,System,DateTimeExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\DateTimeExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System,DateTimeOffsetExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\DateTimeOffsetExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,System,Date,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Date.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 46 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System,Date,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Date.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 54 methods
Insufficient Modularization,System,Date,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Date.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 108
Insufficient Modularization,System,Time,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Time.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 44 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,System,Time,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Time.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,System,Date,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Time\System\Date.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: System.Date' System.Time
