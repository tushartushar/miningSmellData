Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Drawing.Graphics,gdInterpolationMethod,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\DLLImports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,System.Drawing.Graphics,gdStreamWrapper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\GDStreamWrapper.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: gdStreamWrapper which is more interested in members of the type: gdIOCtx
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Drawing.Graphics,ImageExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\ImageExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Drawing.Graphics,Jpg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\Jpg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,System.Drawing.Graphics,Jpg,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\Jpg.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Jpg (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\Jpg.cs' [64' 84])' Png (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\Png.cs' [67' 87])
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Drawing.Graphics,Png,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\Png.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Drawing.Graphics,gdImageStruct,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\DLLImports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: pixels' sx' sy' colorsTotal' red' green' blue' open' transparent' polyInts' polyAllocated' brushColorMap' tileColorMap' styleLength' stylePos' style' interlace' thick' alpha' trueColor' tpixels' alphaBlendingFlag' saveAlphaFlag' AA' AA_color' AA_dont_blend' cx1' cy1' cx2' cy2' res_x' res_y' paletteQuantizationMethod' paletteQuantizationSpeed' paletteQuantizationMinQuality' paletteQuantizationMaxQuality
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Drawing.Graphics,gdIOCtx,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\archived_projects\src\System.Drawing.Graphics\System\Drawing\Graphics\DLLImports.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility.
