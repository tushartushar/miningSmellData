Unutilized Abstraction,System.Buffers,BufferExtensions,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.Primitives\System\Buffers\BufferExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Buffers,IOutput,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.Primitives\System\Buffers\IOutput.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Buffers,OwnedArray<T>,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.Primitives\System\Buffers\OwnedArray.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Buffers,MemoryPool<T>,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.Primitives\System\Buffers\Pooling\MemoryPool.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Runtime,PrimitiveAttribute,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.Primitives\System\Runtime\PrimitiveAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime,PrimitiveAttribute,C:\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\src\System.Buffers.Primitives\System\Runtime\PrimitiveAttribute.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
