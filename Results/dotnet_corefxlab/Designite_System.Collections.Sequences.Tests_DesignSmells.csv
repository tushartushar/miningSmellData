Unutilized Abstraction,System.Collections.Sequences.Tests,SequenceTests,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Collections.Sequences.Tests\BasicUnitTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Collections.Sequences,Entry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Collections.Sequences.Tests\SampleCollections\Hashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: IsEmpty' _pair' _code
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Collections.Sequences,Node,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Collections.Sequences.Tests\SampleCollections\LinkedContainer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' _item' _next
Deficient Encapsulation,System.Collections.Sequences,Entry,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\dotnet_corefxlab\tests\System.Collections.Sequences.Tests\SampleCollections\Hashtable.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: _pair' _code
