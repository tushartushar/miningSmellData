Unnecessary Abstraction,FluentSecurity.TestHelper.Expectations,IExpectation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\Expectations\IExpectation.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,FluentSecurity.TestHelper,ExpectationExpressionExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\ExpectationExpressionExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FluentSecurity.TestHelper,ExpectationResultsExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\ExpectationResultsExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,FluentSecurity.TestHelper,ExpectationVerifyer,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\ExpectationVerifyer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: VerifyExpectationsOf
Unutilized Abstraction,FluentSecurity.TestHelper,SecurityConfigurationExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\SecurityConfigurationExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,FluentSecurity.TestHelper,PolicyContainerExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\PolicyContainerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unexploited Encapsulation,FluentSecurity.TestHelper,ExpectationGroup,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\ExpectationGroup.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: HasTypeExpectation' HasInstanceExpectation' DoesNotHaveInstanceExpectation (in method "ApplyExpectation" of class "ExpectationGroup").
Broken Hierarchy,FluentSecurity.TestHelper.Expectations,DoesNotHaveTypeExpectation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\Expectations\DoesNotHaveTypeExpectation.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FluentSecurity.TestHelper.Expectations.TypeExpectation
Broken Hierarchy,FluentSecurity.TestHelper.Expectations,HasTypeExpectation,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\kristofferahl_FluentSecurity\FluentSecurity.TestHelper\Expectations\HasTypeExpectation.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): FluentSecurity.TestHelper.Expectations.TypeExpectation
