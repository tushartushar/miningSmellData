Unutilized Abstraction,CoreTests,ContextSwitchTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,CoreTests,ContextSwitchTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  ContextSwitchTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs' [3' 26])' FakeToolkit (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\FakeToolkit.cs' [3' 26])

Unnecessary Abstraction,CoreTests,MainFakeToolkit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,CoreTests,SecondaryFakeToolkit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Broken Hierarchy,CoreTests,MainFakeToolkit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CoreTests.FakeToolkit
Broken Hierarchy,CoreTests,SecondaryFakeToolkit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\ContextSwitchTests.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CoreTests.FakeToolkit
Rebellious Hierarchy,CoreTests,FakeToolkit,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mono_xwt\Testing\CoreTests\FakeToolkit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: GetBackendForWindow' GetNativeWidget' GetNativeWindow' HasNativeParent
