Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,DirectionExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\Direction.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,GlyphInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\GlyphInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' codepoint' mask' cluster
Unnecessary Abstraction,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,GlyphPosition,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\GlyphPosition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' xAdvance' yAdvance' xOffset' yOffset
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,GlyphInfo,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\GlyphInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: codepoint' mask' cluster
Deficient Encapsulation,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,GlyphPosition,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\GlyphPosition.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: xAdvance' yAdvance' xOffset' yOffset
Insufficient Modularization,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,HB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\HB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 251 methods
Insufficient Modularization,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,HB,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\HB.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 251
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,Buffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\Buffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpFont.HarfBuzz.Buffer' SharpFont.HarfBuzz.HB
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,Font,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\Font.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpFont.HarfBuzz.Font' SharpFont.HarfBuzz.HB
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,SharpFont.HarfBuzz,Buffer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\Robmaister_SharpFont\Source\SharpFont.HarfBuzz\Buffer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SharpFont.HarfBuzz.Buffer' SharpFont.HarfBuzz.HB' SharpFont.HarfBuzz.Font
