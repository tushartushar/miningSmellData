Unutilized Abstraction,Rnwood.SmtpServer,ICompletedSession,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\ICompletedSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.Auth,AnonymousAuthenticationRequest,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Extensions\Auth\AnonymousAuthenticationRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.Auth,IAuthenticationRequest,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Extensions\Auth\AuthenticationRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions,IExtensionProcessor,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Extensions\Extension.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: EHLOKeywords
Deficient Encapsulation,Rnwood.SmtpServer,SmtpCommand,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\SmtpCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: COMMANDREGEX
Deficient Encapsulation,Rnwood.SmtpServer,SmtpCommand,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\SmtpCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: COMMANDREGEX
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rnwood.SmtpServer,Connection,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rnwood.SmtpServer.Connection' Rnwood.SmtpServer.Server
Insufficient Modularization,Rnwood.SmtpServer,DefaultServerBehaviour,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\DefaultServerBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
Broken Modularization,Rnwood.SmtpServer,ICompletedSession,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\ICompletedSession.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartDate' EndDate' ClientAddress' ClientName' SecureConnection' Log' Messages' CompletedNormally' Authenticated' AuthenticationCredentials' SessionError
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rnwood.SmtpServer,Server,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Server.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rnwood.SmtpServer.Server' Rnwood.SmtpServer.Connection
Broken Hierarchy,Rnwood.SmtpServer,DefaultServer,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\DefaultServer.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Rnwood.SmtpServer.Server
Rebellious Hierarchy,Rnwood.SmtpServer,DefaultServerBehaviour,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\DefaultServerBehaviour.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnMessageRecipientAdding' OnMessageStart' OnCommandReceived
Unfactored Hierarchy,Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.Auth,CramMd5Mechanism,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Extensions\Auth\CramMd5Mechanism.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  CramMd5Mechanism (C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Extensions\Auth\CramMd5Mechanism.cs' [94' 114])' LoginMechanism (C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Extensions\Auth\LoginMechanism.cs' [97' 117])
Wide Hierarchy,Rnwood.SmtpServer.Verbs,IVerb,C:\repos\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.SmtpServer\Verbs\IVerb.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: Rnwood.SmtpServer.DataVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.EhloVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.HeloVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.MailFromVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.MailVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.RcptToVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.RcptVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.QuitVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.Auth.AuthVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.StartTlsVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.Verbs.NoopVerb' Rnwood.SmtpServer.Verbs.RsetVerb
