Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Imperative Abstraction,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ViewMessage
Duplicate Abstraction,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AppContext (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs' [356' 378])' PartViewModel (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\MessageInspector\PartViewModel.cs' [191' 213])
Feature Envy,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: InitServer which is more interested in members of the type: ServerController
Feature Envy,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: MenuListenForConnections_Click which is more interested in members of the type: ServerController
Feature Envy,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ShowMainForm which is more interested in members of the type: MainForm
Duplicate Abstraction,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,MessageViewModel,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\MessageViewModel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Rnwood.Smtp4dev.MessageViewModel' Rnwood.Smtp4dev.MessageInspector.MessageViewModel
Unnecessary Abstraction,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,RegistrySettings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\RegistrySettings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: StartOnLogin
Unutilized Abstraction,XamlGeneratedNamespace,GeneratedInternalTypeHelper,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\obj\Debug\GeneratedInternalTypeHelper.g.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,MainForm,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\MainForm.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
Broken Modularization,Rnwood.Smtp4dev.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' StartInTray' BalloonNotifications' ListenOnStartup' PortNumber' ScrollMessages' AutoViewNewMessages' MinimizeToSysTray' BringToFrontOnNewMessage' SettingsUpgradeRequired' MaxMessages' EnableSSL' Enable8BITMIME' EnableSTARTTLS' SSLCertificatePath' DomainName' EnableSIZE' EnableAUTH' MaximumMessageSize' IPAddress' ReceiveTimeout' AutoInspectNewMessages' InspectOnBalloonClick' RequireSecureConnection' RequireAuthentication' OnlyAllowClearTextAuthOverSecureConnection' LastUpdateCheck' UpdateURL' EnableUpdateCheck' UpdateCheckInterval' UpdateCheckIncludePrerelease' SSLCertificatePassword' UseMessageInspectorOnDoubleClick' defaultInstance
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rnwood.Smtp4dev.AppContext' Rnwood.Smtp4dev.Program' Rnwood.Smtp4dev.OptionsForm
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Rnwood.Smtp4dev,AppContext,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\smorks_smtp4dev\Rnwood.Smtp4dev\AppContext.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rnwood.Smtp4dev.AppContext' Rnwood.Smtp4dev.Program' Rnwood.Smtp4dev.OptionsForm' Rnwood.Smtp4dev.MainForm
