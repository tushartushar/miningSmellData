Unutilized Abstraction,Zmanim.Scheduling,INextRun,C:\repos\Yitzchok_Zmanim\src\Zmanim.Scheduling\INextRun.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Zmanim.Scheduling,ShabbosCalendar,C:\repos\Yitzchok_Zmanim\src\Zmanim.Scheduling\ShabbosCalendar.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Zmanim.Scheduling,ShabbosTriggerListener,C:\repos\Yitzchok_Zmanim\src\Zmanim.Scheduling\ShabbosTriggerListener.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Zmanim.Scheduling,Location,C:\repos\Yitzchok_Zmanim\src\Zmanim.Scheduling\Location.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LocationName' Latitude' Longitude' Elevation' TimeZone
Broken Modularization,Zmanim.Scheduling,Location,C:\repos\Yitzchok_Zmanim\src\Zmanim.Scheduling\Location.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: LocationName' Latitude' Longitude' Elevation' TimeZone
Insufficient Modularization,Zmanim.Scheduling,ZmanimTrigger,C:\repos\Yitzchok_Zmanim\src\Zmanim.Scheduling\ZmanimTrigger.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
