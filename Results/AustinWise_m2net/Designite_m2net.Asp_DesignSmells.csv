Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Cassini,ByteParser,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\ByteParser.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Cassini,Connection,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Connection[1' 23]' Host[1' 23]
Deficient Encapsulation,Cassini,Messages,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: VersionString
Deficient Encapsulation,Cassini,Messages,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Messages.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: VersionString
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassini,Connection,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Connection' Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassini,Connection,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Connection' Host' Server' Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassini,Host,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Host' Server
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassini,Host,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Host' Server' Request
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassini,Host,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Host.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Host' Server' Messages' Request
Insufficient Modularization,Cassini,Request,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cassini,Request,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 50 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Cassini,Request,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 130
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Cassini,Request,F:\newReposMay17\AustinWise_m2net\m2net.Asp\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Request' Host' Server' Host' Server
