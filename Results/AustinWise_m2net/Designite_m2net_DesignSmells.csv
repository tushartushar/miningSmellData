Unutilized Abstraction,m2net,ByteArrayExtensions,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\ByteArrayExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,m2net,Connection,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Connection.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,m2net,Request,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Request.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Unutilized Abstraction,m2net,Tnetstring,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Tnetstring.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,m2net,TPair,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Tnetstring.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Key' Value' Extra
Deficient Encapsulation,m2net,TnetString,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Tnetstring.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Type' IntValue' FloatValue' DictValue' ListValue' BoolValue' StringValue
Deficient Encapsulation,m2net,TnetstringPayload,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Tnetstring.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Payload' PayloadType' Remain
Deficient Encapsulation,m2net,TParseResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\AustinWise_m2net\m2net\Tnetstring.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: Data' Remain
