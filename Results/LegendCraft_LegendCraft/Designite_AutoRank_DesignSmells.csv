Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,AutoRank,AutoRank,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\AutoRank.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AutoRank (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\AutoRank.cs' [2' 21])' Settings (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\Settings.cs' [2' 21])
Duplicate Abstraction,AutoRank,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: AutoRank.Settings' AutoRank.Properties.Settings
Unnecessary Abstraction,AutoRank.Properties,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\Properties\Settings.Designer.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Default' defaultInstance
Deficient Encapsulation,AutoRank,AutoRank,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\AutoRank.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: TreeList
Deficient Encapsulation,AutoRank,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: multiLayered' tempChildNodes' usedConditionals' validRankList
Deficient Encapsulation,AutoRank,Settings,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\LegendCraft_LegendCraft\AutoRank\Settings.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global (public static) fields. Following fields are declared with public static modifiers: multiLayered' tempChildNodes' usedConditionals' validRankList
