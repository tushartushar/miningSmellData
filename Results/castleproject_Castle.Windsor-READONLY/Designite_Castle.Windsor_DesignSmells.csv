List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are:  AbstractContainerDebuggerExtension (C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Windsor\Windsor\Diagnostics\Extensions\AbstractContainerDebuggerExtension.cs' [1' 22])' Facilities (C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Windsor\Windsor\Diagnostics\Extensions\Facilities.cs' [1' 22])
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Windsor.Proxy,AbstractProxyFactory,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Windsor\Windsor\Proxy\AbstractProxyFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Create' Create' RequiresTargetInstance
Missing Hierarchy,Castle.Windsor.Proxy,DefaultProxyFactory,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Windsor\Windsor\Proxy\DefaultProxyFactory.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IOnBehalfAware' IOnBehalfAware (in method "CreateProxyGenerationOptionsFrom" of class "DefaultProxyFactory").
