Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,AbstractAsyncResult,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\AbstractAsyncResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AbstractAsyncResult (C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\AbstractAsyncResult.cs' [1' 20])' Result<T> (C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs' [1' 20])' SynchronizeAttribute (C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeAttribute.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronizeContextReferenceType,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeContextReferenceType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,CreateOnUIThreadInspector,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\CreateOnUIThreadInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessModel
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result<T>,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Imperative Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronizeComponentInspector,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeComponentInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessModel
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronizeInterceptorSelector,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeInterceptorSelector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,AbstractAsyncResult,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\AbstractAsyncResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.AbstractAsyncResult' Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.Timeout
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Timeout,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\AbstractAsyncResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.Timeout' Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.AbstractAsyncResult
Broken Modularization,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Constants,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AmbientContextAttribute' ContextRefAttribute' ContextTypeAttribute' ControlProxyHookAttrib' SynchronizedAttrib' CreateOnUIThead' CustomActivator
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,MarshalingControl,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\CreateOnUIThreadInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnLayout' OnSizeChanged
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.Void.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.AbstractAsyncResult
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronousResult,C:\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronousResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.AbstractAsyncResult
