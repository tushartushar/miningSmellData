Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,AbstractAsyncResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\AbstractAsyncResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  AbstractAsyncResult (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\AbstractAsyncResult.cs' [1' 20])' Result<T> (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs' [1' 20])' SynchronizeAttribute (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeAttribute.cs' [1' 20])
Unutilized Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronizeContextReferenceType,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeContextReferenceType.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Feature Envy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: End which is more interested in members of the type: Result
Feature Envy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: End which is more interested in members of the type: Result
Feature Envy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: End which is more interested in members of the type: Result
Feature Envy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: End which is more interested in members of the type: Result
Imperative Abstraction,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronizeComponentInspector,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeComponentInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ProcessModel
Feature Envy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronizeMetaInfoStore,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronizeMetaInfoStore.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: CreateAttributeFromConfig which is more interested in members of the type: IConversionManager
Broken Modularization,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Constants,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Constants.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' AmbientContextAttribute' ContextRefAttribute' ContextTypeAttribute' ControlProxyHookAttrib' SynchronizedAttrib' CreateOnUIThead' CustomActivator
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result<T>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.Result<T>' Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.Result
Rebellious Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,MarshalingControl,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\CreateOnUIThreadInspector.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: OnLayout' OnSizeChanged
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,Result,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\Result.Void.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.AbstractAsyncResult
Broken Hierarchy,Castle.Facilities.Synchronize,SynchronousResult,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\castleproject_Castle.Windsor-READONLY\src\Castle.Facilities.Synchronize\SynchronousResult.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Castle.Facilities.Synchronize.AbstractAsyncResult
