Unnecessary Abstraction,FlagConsole.Controls,Panel,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\Panel.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Imperative Abstraction,FlagConsole.Drawing,Rectangle,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Drawing\Rectangle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Draw
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FlagConsole.Controls,Container,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\Container.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Container' Control
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FlagConsole.Drawing,Ellipse,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Drawing\Ellipse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ellipse' GraphicBuffer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FlagConsole.Drawing,Ellipse,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Drawing\Ellipse.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Ellipse' GraphicBuffer' Line' GraphicBuffer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FlagConsole.Drawing,Line,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Drawing\Line.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Line' GraphicBuffer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FlagConsole.Drawing,Rectangle,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Drawing\Rectangle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rectangle' GraphicBuffer
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,FlagConsole.Drawing,Rectangle,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Drawing\Rectangle.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Rectangle' GraphicBuffer' Ellipse' GraphicBuffer
Cyclic Hierarchy,FlagConsole.Controls,Control,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\Control.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Container
Broken Hierarchy,FlagConsole.Controls,ListControl,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\ListControl.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Control
Unfactored Hierarchy,FlagConsole.Controls,Menu,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\Menu.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Menu[101' 122]' TextField[50' 71]
Unfactored Hierarchy,FlagConsole.Controls,Menu,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\Menu.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of code clones has been found where at least one pair of classes belong to the same inheritance hierarchy. List of classes with start and end line numbers where clones has been found are: Menu[104' 125]' TextBox[70' 91]
Broken Hierarchy,FlagConsole.Controls,Panel,F:\newReposMay17\flagbug_FlagConsole\FlagConsole\FlagConsole\Controls\Panel.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Container
