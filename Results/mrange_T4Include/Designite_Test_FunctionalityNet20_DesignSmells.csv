Imperative Abstraction,Source.HRON,HRONSerializer,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Parse
Unnecessary Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,ExtensionAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,System.Runtime.CompilerServices,ExtensionAttribute,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Source.Common,Array<T>,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' Empty' Empty' Empty
Unnecessary Abstraction,Source.Common,InitConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DefaultCulture' DefaultCulture' DefaultCulture
Unutilized Abstraction,Source.Common,SubStringExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Multifaceted Abstraction,Source.Common,SubString,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 0.81
Unutilized Abstraction,FileInclude.Include,MetaData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Source.Common,InitConfig,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DefaultCulture' DefaultCulture' DefaultCulture
Insufficient Modularization,Source.Common,SubStringExtensions,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Source.Common,SubString,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Source.Common,SubString,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 36 methods
Broken Modularization,FileInclude.Include,MetaData,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' RootPath' IncludeDate' Include_0' Include_1' Include_2' Include_3' Include_4' Include_5
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Source.HRON,IHRONVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Source.HRON.IHRONVisitor' Source.HRON.HRONSerializer
Rebellious Hierarchy,Source.HRON,HRONWriterVisitor,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\mrange_T4Include\NonSource\Tests\Test_FunctionalityNet20\IncludeFiles.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: Document_Begin' Document_End
