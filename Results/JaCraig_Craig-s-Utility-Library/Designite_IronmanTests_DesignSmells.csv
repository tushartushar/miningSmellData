Unutilized Abstraction,IronmanTests.API,Manager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\IronmanTests\API\Manager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,IronmanTests.API,Manager,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\IronmanTests\API\Manager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  Manager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\IronmanTests\API\Manager.cs' [1' 21])' PluginManager (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\IronmanTests\Plugins\PluginManager.cs' [1' 21])
Unnecessary Abstraction,IronmanTests.API,TestClass,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\IronmanTests\API\Manager.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: A' B' C' D' E
