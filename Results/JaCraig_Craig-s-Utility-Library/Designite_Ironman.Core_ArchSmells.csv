Architecture smell,Project,Namespace,Cause
Cyclic Dependency,Ironman.Core,Ironman.Core.API.Manager.Interfaces,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Ironman.Core.API.Manager.Interfaces' Ironman.Core.API.Manager
Cyclic Dependency,Ironman.Core,Ironman.Core.Assets,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: Ironman.Core.Assets' Ironman.Core.Assets.Less
Unstable Dependency,Ironman.Core,Ironman.Core.ActionFilters,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Utilities.IO
Unstable Dependency,Ironman.Core,Ironman.Core.API.Manager,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): Utilities.Workflow.Manager' Ironman.Core.API.Manager.Interfaces
