Unutilized Abstraction,Utilities.Profiler,TimerExtensions,C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\ExtensionMethods\TimerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Utilities.Profiler,TimerExtensions,C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\ExtensionMethods\TimerExtensions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  TimerExtensions (C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\ExtensionMethods\TimerExtensions.cs' [1' 22])' Profiler (C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Profiler.cs' [1' 22])' IProfiler (C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Manager\Interfaces\IProfiler.cs' [1' 22])' Manager (C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Manager\Manager.cs' [1' 22])

Duplicate Abstraction,Utilities.Profiler,Profiler,C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Profiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Utilities.Profiler.Profiler' Utilities.Profiler.Manager.Default.Profiler
Duplicate Abstraction,Utilities.Profiler.Manager.Default,Profiler,C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Manager\Default\Profiler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class.

Unnecessary Abstraction,Utilities.Profiler.Manager.Interfaces,IResult,C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Manager\Interfaces\IResult.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: CalledFrom' Children' Entries
Unnecessary Abstraction,Utilities.Profiler.Manager.Interfaces,IResultEntry,C:\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\Utilities.Profiler\Profiler\Manager\Interfaces\IResultEntry.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
