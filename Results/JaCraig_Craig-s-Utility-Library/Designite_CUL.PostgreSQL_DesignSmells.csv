Unnecessary Abstraction,CUL.PostgreSQL.QueryProvider,PostgreSQLGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\QueryProvider\PostgreSQLGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: 
Unutilized Abstraction,CUL.PostgreSQL.QueryProvider,PostgreSQLGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\QueryProvider\PostgreSQLGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,CUL.PostgreSQL.QueryProvider,PostgreSQLGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\QueryProvider\PostgreSQLGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PostgreSQLGenerator (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\QueryProvider\PostgreSQLGenerator.cs' [1' 23])' PostgreSQLQueryProvider (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\QueryProvider\PostgreSQLQueryProvider.cs' [1' 23])

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,CUL.PostgreSQL.Schema,PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs' [405' 427])' PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs' [436' 458])
Unexploited Encapsulation,CUL.PostgreSQL.Schema,PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IManyToMany' IIEnumerableManyToOne' IListManyToOne (in method "SetupJoiningTables" of class "PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator").
Unexploited Encapsulation,CUL.PostgreSQL.Schema,PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IManyToMany' IIEnumerableManyToOne' IListManyToOne (in method "SetupProperties" of class "PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator").
Insufficient Modularization,CUL.PostgreSQL.Schema,PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 38 methods
Insufficient Modularization,CUL.PostgreSQL.Schema,PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 122
Missing Hierarchy,CUL.PostgreSQL.Schema,PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\JaCraig_Craig-s-Utility-Library\CUL.PostgreSQL\Schema\PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IMap' IManyToOne' IListManyToMany (in method "SetupJoiningTables" of class "PostgreSQLSchemaGenerator").
