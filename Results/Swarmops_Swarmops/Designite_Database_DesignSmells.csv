Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,Swarmops.Database,SwarmDb,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Swarmops.Database,DatabaseCondition,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\Database-Conditions.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Swarmops.Database,RecordLimit,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\RecordLimit.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Swarmops.Database,TableBase<TBasic>,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\TableBase.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Insufficient Modularization,Swarmops.Database,SwarmDb,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 592 public methods
Insufficient Modularization,Swarmops.Database,SwarmDb,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 700 methods
Insufficient Modularization,Swarmops.Database,SwarmDb,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e.' WMC) is: 1187
Missing Hierarchy,Swarmops.Database,SwarmDb,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Database\Configuration.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IHasIdentities' IHasSingularPluralTypes' DatabaseCondition' DbEnumField (in method "ConstructWhereClauseRecurse" of class "SwarmDb").
