Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,Swarmops.Backend,BackendLoop,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Backend\BackendLoop.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Swarmops.Backend.BackendLoop' Swarmops.Backend.SocketServices.BackendServices
Missing Hierarchy,Swarmops.Backend,CommsTransmitter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos1\Swarmops_Swarmops\Backend\CommsTransmitter.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: IHasGeography' IHasGeography (in method "Run" of class "CommsTransmitter").
