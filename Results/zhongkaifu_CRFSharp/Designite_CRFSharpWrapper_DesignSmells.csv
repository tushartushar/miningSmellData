Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unnecessary Abstraction,CRFSharpWrapper,SegToken,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\CRFSharpHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' offset' length' strTag' fWeight
Duplicate Abstraction,CRFSharpWrapper,Decoder,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\Decoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are: Decoder[68' 105]' Decoder[112' 149]
Imperative Abstraction,CRFSharpWrapper,Encoder,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\Encoder.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: Learn
Deficient Encapsulation,CRFSharpWrapper,EncoderArgs,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\Args.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: max_iter' min_feature_freq' min_diff' slot_usage_rate_threshold' threads_num' regType' strTemplateFileName' strTrainingCorpus' strEncodedModelFileName' strRetrainModelFileName' debugLevel' hugeLexMemLoad' C' bVQ
Deficient Encapsulation,CRFSharpWrapper,DecoderArgs,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\Args.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: strModelFileName' strInputFileName' strOutputFileName' strOutputSegFileName' nBest' thread' probLevel' maxword
Deficient Encapsulation,CRFSharpWrapper,SegToken,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\CRFSharpHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: offset' length' strTag' fWeight
Deficient Encapsulation,CRFSharpWrapper,crf_seg_out,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\CRFSharpHelper.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: termTotalLength' tokenList
Broken Modularization,CRFSharpWrapper,EncoderArgs,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\Args.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' max_iter' min_feature_freq' min_diff' slot_usage_rate_threshold' threads_num' regType' strTemplateFileName' strTrainingCorpus' strEncodedModelFileName' strRetrainModelFileName' debugLevel' hugeLexMemLoad' C' bVQ
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,CRFSharpWrapper,EncoderArgs,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\Args.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: EncoderArgs' Encoder
Broken Hierarchy,CRFSharpWrapper,SegDecoderTagger,D:\newReposJune17\zhongkaifu_CRFSharp\Core\CRFSharpWrapper\SegDecoderTagger.cs,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): DecoderTagger
