Unutilized Abstraction,Router,GCodeLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\GCodeLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Router,GCodeLoader,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\GCodeLoader.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  GCodeLoader (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\GCodeLoader.cs' [1' 22])' Router (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Router.cs' [1' 22])' PathPlanner (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs' [1' 22])' Tabs (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\Tabs.cs' [1' 22])
Imperative Abstraction,Router.Paths,PathPlanner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: PlanPaths
Unutilized Abstraction,Router.Paths,PathPlanner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Router.Paths,PathPlanner,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  PathPlanner (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs' [1' 25])' Tabs (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\Tabs.cs' [1' 25])
Imperative Abstraction,Router.Paths,PathTree,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: ObliterateSlice
Deficient Encapsulation,Router.Paths,Hole,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Router\Paths\PathPlanner.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: topPolygon' polygons' toolRadius' cleanRoutFactor
