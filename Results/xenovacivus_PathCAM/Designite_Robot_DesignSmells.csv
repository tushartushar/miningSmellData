Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Duplicate Abstraction,Robot,DataConverter,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\DataConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  DataConverter (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\DataConverter.cs' [1' 21])' IRobotCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\IRobotCommand.cs' [1' 21])' Robot (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\Robot.cs' [1' 21])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Robot,int_or_float,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\DataConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' FloatValue' IntValue
Duplicate Abstraction,Robot,IRobotCommand,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\IRobotCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  IRobotCommand (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\IRobotCommand.cs' [1' 22])' Robot (D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\Robot.cs' [1' 22])
Unutilized Abstraction,Robot,Robot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\Robot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Deficient Encapsulation,Robot,int_or_float,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\DataConverter.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: FloatValue' IntValue
Deficient Encapsulation,Robot,Robot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\Robot.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: onRobotStatusChange' z_offset
Unexploited Encapsulation,Robot,Robot,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\Robot.cs,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: IRobotCommandWithStatus' RobotDetectionCommand (in method "NewDataAvailable" of class "Robot").
Broken Modularization,Robot,IRobotCommandWithStatus,D:\research\architectureSmells\repos\xenovacivus_PathCAM\Robot\IRobotCommand.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Paused' Pausing' SteppersEnabled' CurrentPosition' Time' CanAcceptMoveCommand
