Unnecessary Abstraction,Signum.TSGenerator,AssemblyReference,C:\repos\signumsoftware_framework\Signum.TSGenerator\EntityDeclarationGenerator.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' ReactDirectory' AssemblyFullPath' AssemblyName' AllTypescriptFiles' NamespacesReferences
