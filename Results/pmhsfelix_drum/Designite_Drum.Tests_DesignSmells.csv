Imperative Abstraction,Drum.Tests,InjectionUsingUnityTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingUnity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: UriMaker_is_ctor_injected_using_Unity
Unutilized Abstraction,Drum.Tests,InjectionUsingUnityTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingUnity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Drum.Tests,InjectionUsingUnityTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingUnity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because a set of code clones has been found and at least one of the clones found in this class. List of code clones with start and end line numbers are:  InjectionUsingUnityTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingUnity.cs' [78' 109])' InjectionUsingAutofacTests (C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingAutofacTests.cs' [48' 79])
Unnecessary Abstraction,Drum.Tests,CurrentRequest,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingUnity.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: Value
Unutilized Abstraction,Drum.Tests,InjectionUsingAutofacTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\InjectionUsingAutofacTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Drum.Tests,MultipleRouteTests,C:\research\architectureSmells\repos\pmhsfelix_drum\src\Drum.Tests\MultipleRouteTests.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
