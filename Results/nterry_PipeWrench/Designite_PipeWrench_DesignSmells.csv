Design smell,Namespace,Class,File,Cause
Unutilized Abstraction,PipeWrench.Lib.Domain,TunnelInfo,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\Domain\TunnelInfo.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,PipeWrench.Lib.Util,ExtensionMethods,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\Util\ExtensionMethods.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PipeWrench.Lib,IMessageHandler,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\IMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMessageHandler' Tunnel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PipeWrench.Lib,IMessageHandler,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\IMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IMessageHandler' Tunnel' IServiceBinding
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PipeWrench.Lib,IServiceBinding,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\IServiceBinding.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IServiceBinding' IMessageHandler' Tunnel' IMessageHandler' Tunnel
Cyclically-dependent Modularization,PipeWrench.Lib.MessageHandlers,DefaultMessageHandler,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\MessageHandlers\DefaultMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: DefaultMessageHandler' TunnelManager
Rebellious Hierarchy,PipeWrench.Lib.MessageHandlers,DefaultMessageHandler,C:\repos\nterry_PipeWrench\PipeWrench\Lib\MessageHandlers\DefaultMessageHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: DispatchToServiceBinding' DispatchToTunnel' RecieveThreadDeathFromTunnel
